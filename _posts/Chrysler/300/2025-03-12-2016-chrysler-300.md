The 2016 Chrysler 300 is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and stylish design. Engine options for the 2016 model year include a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 292 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (or 300 hp/264 lb-ft in the 300S) and a 5.7L HEMI V8 producing 363 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 300's smooth ride, upscale interior, and powerful V8 option. Common complaints often include lower fuel economy (especially with the V8), some reliability concerns, and the relatively dated infotainment system compared to newer vehicles.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Rocker Arm Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, and potential engine damage. This is often caused by the rocker arms becoming worn or damaged due to poor lubrication or material defects.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed rocker arms. In some cases, the camshaft and lifters may also need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks near the oil filter, potentially causing low oil pressure and engine damage. The plastic oil filter housing is prone to cracking or warping.
    *   Solution: Replacing the oil filter housing with an updated design, often made of aluminum, to prevent future leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **HEMI Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A distinct ticking or tapping noise coming from the engine, especially at idle or low speeds. This is often attributed to exhaust manifold bolts breaking, or wear on the lifters or camshaft.

**Summary**

The 2016 Chrysler 300 can be a comfortable and stylish sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems like rocker arm failure, oil filter housing leaks (on the V6), the "HEMI tick", and excessive oil consumption (on the V8) can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, rough shifting and hesitation, or even total failure, are also something to watch out for. Other common issues include front suspension noises and electrical glitches with the Uconnect system or TIPM. While not all 2016 Chrysler 300s will experience these issues, pre-purchase inspections and a thorough maintenance history review are highly recommended. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars.
