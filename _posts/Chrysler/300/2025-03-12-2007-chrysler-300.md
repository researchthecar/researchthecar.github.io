The 2007 Chrysler 300 is a full-size sedan known for its bold styling and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.7L V6 (190 hp, 190 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L V6 (250 hp, 250 lb-ft of torque), a 5.7L Hemi V8 (340 hp, 390 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.1L Hemi V8 (425 hp, 420 lb-ft of torque) in the SRT8 model. The 2.7L and 3.5L engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.7L and 6.1L came with a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 300's spacious interior and distinctive looks, while common complaints include fuel economy (especially with the V8 engines), some reliability concerns, and the use of lower-quality interior materials in some areas.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Oil Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 engine is known for being prone to oil sludge buildup, especially if oil changes are neglected. This can lead to reduced oil flow, overheating, and eventually engine failure. Symptoms include engine knocking, poor performance, and low oil pressure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil are crucial to prevent sludge buildup. If sludge is already present, engine flushing or even engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Engine flush ($100-$200), Engine replacement ($3,000 - $5,000+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.5L engine may experience timing chain wear or failure, leading to rough running, misfires, and engine noise.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking noise originating from the engine, often most noticeable at idle. This is commonly attributed to exhaust manifold leaks, lifter issues, or other valve train components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is key. Exhaust manifold leaks can be repaired by replacing gaskets or manifolds. Lifter issues may require lifter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Exhaust manifold repair ($200 - $800), Lifter replacement ($1000 - $2500+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **MDS (Multi-Displacement System) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MDS system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can sometimes cause issues such as rough idling, misfires, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial to determine the cause. Solutions may include replacing faulty MDS solenoids, or disabling the MDS system altogether.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Solenoid replacement ($300 - $600), MDS delete (depending on parts and labor $500+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.1L Hemi V8 (SRT8)**
* No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Typically paired with 2.7L and 3.5L V6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can experience harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Fluid change may temporarily alleviate symptoms. However, a more thorough inspection is needed to determine the cause. It could be a faulty solenoid pack, or internal damage requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change ($100 - $200), Solenoid pack replacement ($400 - $800), Rebuild/Replacement ($2,000 - $4,000+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (Typically paired with 5.7L and 6.1L Hemi V8)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting, rough shifting, or complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the front lower control arm bushings resulting in clunking noises and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bushing Failure in the rear suspension results in clunking or rattling sounds coming from the rear suspension while driving over bumps or rough roads.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the bushings or associated suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls many electrical functions and is known to fail, causing a variety of symptoms including stalling, no-start conditions, fuel pump issues, and erratic operation of various accessories (windows, locks, lights).
