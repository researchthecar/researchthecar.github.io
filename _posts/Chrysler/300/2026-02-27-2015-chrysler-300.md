### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Chrysler 300 generally presents a solid reliability record, particularly for its powertrain when properly maintained. The Pentastar V6 and HEMI V8 engines are robust, though some owners have reported coolant and oil leaks, which are often manageable repairs. The 8-speed automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit shifting issues, often resolved with software updates or fluid services. Suspension components, especially on models with air suspension, may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Uconnect system and occasional battery drain, are the most frequently cited non-routine issues. Overall, the 2015 300 is a reliable choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and ensure a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
