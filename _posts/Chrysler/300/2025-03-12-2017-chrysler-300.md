The 2017 Chrysler 300 is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available V8 power. Engine options include a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 292 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (or 300 hp/264 lb-ft in the 300S), and a 5.7L HEMI V8 delivering 363 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the 300's stylish design, smooth ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. Some criticisms include lower fuel economy than some competitors and a somewhat dated interior design compared to newer vehicles.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Tick Sound After Oil Change**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported a ticking sound coming from the engine, particularly after an oil change. The sound is noticeable at idle and low speeds.
    *   Solution: The problem may be due to the use of an incorrect oil filter or incorrect oil type. Some owners report that using a Mopar oil filter and the correct oil specification (consult your owner's manual) resolves the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $30 for oil filter and oil.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **"Hemi Tick"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or tapping sound coming from the engine, especially at idle. This is sometimes referred to as the "Hemi Tick" and is more prevalent at startup or when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: There is no definitive fix, but some owners have had success using specific oil additives or switching to a higher viscosity oil. Some mechanics have suggested that it may be related to the MDS (Multi-Displacement System) lifters, but there is no service bulletin to confirm it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ depending on the fix.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough shifting, particularly between lower gears, as well as hesitation when accelerating.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In other cases, replacement of the valve body has been required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 for software update, $800-$1500+ for valve body replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In rare cases, some owners have reported complete transmission failure requiring replacement.
    *   Solution: Transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ depending on whether a new or refurbished transmission is used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Clunking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A clunking or rattling noise coming from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps or uneven surfaces. The noise is more noticeable at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: The issue may be due to worn sway bar links or bushings. Replacing these components can often resolve the noise. In some cases, worn strut mounts or ball joints may also contribute to the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per side for sway bar links/bushings. $300 - $600+ for struts and mounts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the Uconnect infotainment system, including freezing, lagging, and difficulty connecting to Bluetooth.
    *   Solution: Updating the Uconnect software to the latest version can often resolve these issues. In some cases, a complete system reset or replacement of the Uconnect module may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update, $500 - $1500+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Potential causes include parasitic draw from aftermarket accessories or a faulty module not properly shutting down. Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replace the faulty component. A failing battery may also cause this.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the source of the draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctioning, either not opening/closing properly or getting stuck.
    *   Solution: Check the sunroof tracks for debris or obstructions and clean them. Lubricate the tracks with a silicone-based lubricant. If the motor is failing, it needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $20 for cleaning/lubrication, $300-$700+ for motor replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chrysler 300, while generally reliable, can suffer from some common issues. Engine ticking noises are reported, especially on the HEMI V8, while transmission problems can range from rough shifting to complete failure. Electrical issues, particularly with the Uconnect system and battery drain, are also a concern. Suspension noises are also reported due to worn suspension components. Repair costs vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage, but can range from minor expenses to significant costs for major component replacement. Addressing these issues promptly is recommended to maintain the vehicle's reliability and performance.
