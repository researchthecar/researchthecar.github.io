### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Chrysler 300 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the standard 3.5L V6 engine and overall exterior are generally robust, owners may encounter issues with the 5.7L HEMI engine, particularly concerning oil leaks and the cylinder deactivation system. The 5-speed automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting and leaks. Suspension components like ball joints and struts may require replacement over time. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module or alternator failure, are also noted.
