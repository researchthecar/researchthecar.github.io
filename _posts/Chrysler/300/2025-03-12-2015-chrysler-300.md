The 2015 Chrysler 300 is a full-size sedan that offers a blend of comfort, style, and performance. Engine options include a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 292 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (or 300 hp and 264 lb-ft in the 300S trim), and a 5.7L Hemi V8 producing 363 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the 300 for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and distinctive styling. Common dislikes include its fuel economy and sometimes dated infotainment system. This list will cover common issues specific to the 2015 model year.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Engine Misfire/Check Engine Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may misfire, leading to rough idling, decreased power, and illumination of the check engine light. Codes P0300-P0306 (indicating misfires on specific cylinders) are common. Sometimes caused by failed ignition coils or faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of faulty ignition coils or fuel injectors, and spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per ignition coil/fuel injector (including labor). Spark plugs are $100-$200 for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic oil filter housing is prone to cracking and leaking. This can lead to oil loss and potential engine damage. Look for oil pooling under the vehicle or around the oil filter housing area.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing with an updated design, typically made from aluminum.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **"Hemi Tick"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking noise, often described as the "Hemi Tick," emanating from the engine. The cause is debated, but it is often attributed to issues within the valvetrain, such as lifter noise or exhaust manifold leaks.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, the fix can range from replacing exhaust manifold bolts/gaskets to replacing lifters or even the camshaft.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (exhaust manifold bolts) - $2,000+ (camshaft/lifter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts causing exhaust leaks. This can cause a ticking noise, reduced fuel economy, and an exhaust smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of broken exhaust manifold bolts and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (845RE/8HP45)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. Some owners report a "clunking" noise during shifts.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush, software updates, or, in more severe cases, valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (fluid flush), $500 - $1500+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid leak from the transmission pan gasket or other seals.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Squeaking/Creaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or creaking noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can be caused by worn-out bushings, ball joints, or sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components such as bushings, ball joints, or sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component (depending on location and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or exhibit software glitches. Bluetooth connectivity issues and navigation problems are also reported.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system resets, or, in some cases, replacement of the Uconnect module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software updates) - $1000+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TPMS light illuminates despite correct tire pressures, or the system provides inaccurate readings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty TPMS sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per sensor (including installation).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture accumulating inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Removal and resealing of the headlight housings, or replacement of the headlights.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chrysler 300 is a stylish and comfortable sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems, particularly oil leaks and the "Hemi tick," are relatively common and can be costly to address. Transmission issues, especially rough shifting, can also occur. Electrical problems, such as Uconnect glitches, can be frustrating. Suspension squeaks and interior issues such as sunroofs and heated/cooled seats, while less severe, can still be a nuisance. Overall, while the 2015 Chrysler 300 offers a lot of value and appeal, a thorough inspection and consideration of these potential issues is recommended before purchasing.
