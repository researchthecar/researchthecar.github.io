- **Solution:** Replacement of leaking seals (e.g., valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, crankshaft seal).
- **Cost:** $200 - $600


## Transmission

### 4-Speed Automatic (41TE/42LE)
**Slipping Gears**
- **Symptoms:** Delayed engagement, harsh shifting, loss of power during acceleration.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or complete transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2500

**Overheating**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission fluid smells burnt, erratic shifting, transmission warning light.
- **Solution:** Flushing transmission fluid, installing an auxiliary transmission cooler.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**Strut Mount Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Popping or creaking noises when turning, rough ride.
- **Solution:** Replacement of strut mounts and potentially the struts themselves.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows, locks, or interior lights malfunctioning randomly; dashboard warning lights illuminating without cause.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000


### Alternator
**Premature Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Dimming headlights, battery warning light, difficulty starting the engine.

### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chrysler Cirrus presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components can be durable if maintained, common issues such as head gasket failures on the 2.4L engine and transmission problems like slipping gears and overheating are frequently reported. Suspension components, particularly ball joints and tie rod ends, are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or alternator, can lead to frustrating and costly repairs. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior components like HVAC blend doors and power window regulators are known failure points. Overall, while not inherently unreliable, the Cirrus requires diligent maintenance and awareness of its common weak spots to ensure long-term serviceability.
