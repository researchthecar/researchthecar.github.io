### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chrysler Cirrus presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly the automatic transmission's tendency for slipping or overheating, and potential head gasket failures in the 2.4L engine. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and wear on suspension components like ball joints are also frequently reported. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these specific components. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate costs and prolong the vehicle's life.
