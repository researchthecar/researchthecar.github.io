The 2004 Chrysler Sebring (also known as the Cirrus in some markets) was a mid-size sedan offering a blend of comfort and affordability. Available engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 hp and 167 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 producing 200 hp and 190 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing 200 hp and 205 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Sebring's spacious interior and comfortable ride. Common complaints centered around reliability issues, particularly with electrical components and some engine/transmission combinations.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various seals and gaskets on the engine, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. Common leak points include the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and crankshaft seals.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the location of the leak and labor costs.

*   **Rough Idling/Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when accelerating, stalling at idle, and misfires
    * Solution: Check for vacuum leaks, ignition components, and fuel delivery issues. Replacing faulty sensors, such as the idle air control valve or oxygen sensor, or cleaning the throttle body can resolve this issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the problem and parts.

**2.7L V6**

*   **Sludging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 is notorious for developing oil sludge due to its cooling system design. This can lead to oil starvation, bearing failure, and catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include engine knocking, overheating, and low oil pressure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil are crucial. In severe cases, the engine may require extensive cleaning or complete replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil change) - $3000+ (engine replacement)

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump in the 2.7L V6 is prone to failure, leading to overheating. Signs include coolant leaks, engine temperature gauge rising, and steam coming from under the hood.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**3.0L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may originate from valve cover gaskets, rear main seals, or oil pan gaskets. Common symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn or damaged gaskets/seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $75 - $400+ depending on location and labor.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic or harsh shifting, delayed engagement, and slipping between gears are common complaints. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced, or the transmission may require a complete overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $2500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering, stalling, and a lack of power transfer.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll in corners, and increased stopping distance are signs of worn struts and shocks.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on parts and labor.

*   **Broken/Worn Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower to the ground or uneven, strange noises from one of the wheels/corners
    *   Solution: Replace the broken/worn springs
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ depending on parts and labor.

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Power Windows/Locks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows and door locks. This can be due to faulty switches, wiring issues, or a failing power window motor or door lock actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty switch, repair wiring issues, or replace the power window motor or door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per window/lock.

*   **Instrument Cluster Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster may experience issues such as flickering lights, inaccurate readings, or complete failure. This can be caused by a faulty cluster, wiring problems, or a bad sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the instrument cluster, repair wiring issues, or replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the problem.

*   **ABS Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABS light may illuminate on the dashboard, and the ABS system may not function properly. This can be caused by a faulty ABS module.

**Summary:**

The 2004 Chrysler Sebring (Cirrus) presents a mixed bag for potential owners. While it offered a comfortable ride and spacious interior, reliability issues, particularly with the 2.7L V6 and the 4-speed automatic transmission, are prevalent. The 2.7L engine's sludging issues are particularly concerning due to the potential for catastrophic engine failure. Electrical problems, suspension wear, and interior issues further contribute to the ownership experience. Repair costs can range from relatively minor fixes to substantial expenses for engine or transmission work. Careful inspection and a thorough maintenance history are essential before purchasing one of these vehicles.
