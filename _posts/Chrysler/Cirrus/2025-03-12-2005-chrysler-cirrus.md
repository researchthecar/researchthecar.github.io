The 2005 Chrysler Cirrus is a mid-size sedan that offered a mix of affordability and comfort. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Cirrus for its spacious interior and smooth ride, while common complaints included lackluster fuel economy and build quality.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often originating from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected gasket or seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the location of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rough Idling and Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling or hesitation during acceleration. This can be due to issues with the idle air control (IAC) valve, throttle position sensor (TPS), or vacuum leaks.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor or repairing vacuum leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6**

* **Sludge Buildup**
    * Description/Symptoms: This engine is notorious for sludge buildup in the oil passages, especially if oil changes are neglected. This can lead to oil starvation, overheating, and ultimately engine failure. Symptoms can include engine knocking, reduced performance, and oil pressure warning light.
    * Solution: In severe cases, engine replacement. In milder cases, a thorough engine flush and regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (flush) - $3000+ (engine replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The water pump is prone to failure, leading to coolant leaks and overheating.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting between gears. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn solenoids in the valve body, or internal damage to the transmission.
    * Solution: Checking and replacing the transmission fluid, replacing solenoids, or rebuilding/replacing the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (fluid change) - $2500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping, particularly when accelerating or going uphill. This indicates internal wear and tear.
    * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
