The 2002 Chrysler Cirrus was a mid-size sedan aimed at providing a comfortable and affordable driving experience. It was offered with a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing around 150 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L V6 engine producing around 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Cirrus for its spacious interior and smooth ride. However, common complaints included issues with reliability, particularly regarding electrical and cooling system components.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often originating from the valve cover gasket or oil pan gasket.  This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket(s).  Inspect other seals and gaskets for deterioration and replace as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 2.4L engine is an interference engine. If the timing belt breaks, the engine will experience catastrophic engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the timing belt before its service interval.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 is prone to oil sludge buildup, especially if oil changes are not performed regularly.  This can lead to poor lubrication, engine knocking, and ultimately, engine failure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality oil are crucial. In severe cases, the engine may require disassembly and cleaning, or even replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (oil change and flush), $2000 - $5000+ (engine repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump, located inside the timing chain case, is prone to failure, leading to overheating and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump.  This often requires removing the timing chain cover, which is a labor-intensive process.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (41TE/A604)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting gears, harsh or jerky shifts, or transmission slipping. This can be due to wear and tear on the internal components, or issues with the valve body.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may temporarily alleviate the symptoms. More serious issues may require valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $500 - $1500+ (valve body replacement), $2000 - $4000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Stalling, shuddering, or vibrations, particularly at low speeds or when coming to a stop.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during turns, and poor handling.  Noises (clunking or squeaking) coming from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, often one or more windows becoming inoperable. This can be due to a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor and/or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per window)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning (speedometer, fuel gauge, etc.), the cluster not lighting up properly, or intermittent failure.
    *   Solution:  In some cases, the cluster can be repaired. Otherwise, replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

**Summary**

The 2002 Chrysler Cirrus, while offering a comfortable ride and spacious interior, is prone to several reliability issues. The most concerning problems relate to the 2.7L V6 engine's sludge buildup and potential for catastrophic failure. Transmission issues are also common. Suspension and electrical problems contribute to the overall cost of ownership. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major repairs that can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, and should have a qualified mechanic perform a pre-purchase inspection.
