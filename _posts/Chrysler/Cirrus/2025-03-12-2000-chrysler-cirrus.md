The 2000 Chrysler Cirrus was a mid-size sedan offered with three engine choices: a 2.0L inline-4, a 2.4L inline-4, and a 2.5L V6. The 2.5L V6 produced approximately 168 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. It was designed to offer a blend of comfort and affordability. Owners often praised its spacious interior and smooth ride, but common complaints included reliability issues, particularly with electrical components and some engine variants. The Cirrus was also known for its attractive styling, but some found its handling less sporty than competitors.
