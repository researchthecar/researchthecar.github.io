**2.7L V6**

*   **Sludging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This engine is prone to oil sludge buildup if oil changes are not performed regularly with the correct oil type. Sludging can lead to poor engine performance, increased wear, and potential engine failure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with synthetic oil and potentially engine flush treatments. In severe cases, engine teardown and cleaning or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3000+

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump is located inside the timing cover on the 2.7L engine, so when it fails, coolant leaks into the oil. This can cause serious engine damage if not addressed quickly. Symptoms include coolant loss, overheating, and milky oil.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump, timing chain, and potentially other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
