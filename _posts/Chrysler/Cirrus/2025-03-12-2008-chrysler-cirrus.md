The 2008 Chrysler Cirrus, also known as the Sebring in some markets, offered a blend of comfort and style aimed at the mid-size sedan market. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing around 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 generating approximately 186 horsepower and 191 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 that put out around 235 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 engines used a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally liked the Cirrus's comfortable ride and spacious interior, but common complaints centered around build quality, reliability issues, and some unrefined powertrain characteristics.
