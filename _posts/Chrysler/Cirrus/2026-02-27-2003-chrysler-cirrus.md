- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2500+

**Torque Converter Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Shuddering at low speeds, slipping, whining noise, difficulty accelerating.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the torque converter, often done in conjunction with a transmission service.
- **Cost:** $600 - $1200


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, loose steering, uneven tire wear, pulling to one side.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Strut Mount Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Popping or creaking noises when turning, rough ride, uneven vehicle height.
- **Solution:** Replacement of strut mounts and potentially the struts themselves.
- **Cost:** $250 - $500


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Malfunctioning power windows, door locks, interior lights, or dashboard warning lights. Can be sporadic.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chrysler Cirrus, while offering a comfortable ride, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of its age and class. Engine issues like head gasket failures and oil leaks, particularly with the 2.4L, and transmission problems such as slipping gears and torque converter issues are notable. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and alternator, can be frustrating. Exterior rust and interior wear, particularly dashboard cracking and HVAC blend door failures, are also points to consider. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections.
