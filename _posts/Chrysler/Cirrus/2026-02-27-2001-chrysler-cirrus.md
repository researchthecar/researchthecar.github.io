### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chrysler Cirrus, while offering a comfortable ride, exhibits common issues for its age and class. The engines, particularly the 2.0L and 2.4L, are prone to head gasket failures and oil leaks. Automatic transmissions can develop shifting problems and cooler line leaks. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can arise. Exterior rust and interior HVAC/power window issues are also frequently reported. Despite these potential problems, many issues are repairable, but buyers should be aware of these common failure points and factor potential repair costs into their ownership considerations.
