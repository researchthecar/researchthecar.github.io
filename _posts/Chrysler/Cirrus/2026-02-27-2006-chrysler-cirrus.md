## Engine

### 2.4L DOHC I4
**Head Gasket Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, milky oil.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the head gasket and potentially resurfacing the cylinder head.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500

**Oil Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil drips under the vehicle, low oil level, burning oil smell.
- **Solution:** Replacement of seals and gaskets (e.g., valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket).
- **Cost:** $200 - $600


## Transmission

### 4-Speed Automatic (41TE/42LE)
**Slipping Gears**
- **Symptoms:** Delayed engagement, difficulty shifting, engine revving without acceleration.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or full transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2500

**Harsh Shifting**
- **Symptoms:** Jerking or clunking during gear changes.
- **Solution:** Transmission control module (TCM) reset, solenoid replacement, or fluid flush.
- **Cost:** $300 - $1000


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**Premature Strut/Shock Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Bouncy ride, poor handling, visible leaks from struts/shocks.
- **Solution:** Replacement of struts and/or shocks.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows, locks, or interior lights malfunctioning intermittently.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1200


### Alternator
**Premature Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Dimming headlights, battery warning light, dead battery.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Exterior

### Body Panels and Trim
**Rust and Corrosion**
- **Symptoms:** Visible rust spots, particularly on wheel wells, rocker panels, and door bottoms.
- **Solution:** Rust repair and repainting, or replacement of affected panels.
- **Cost:** $300 - $1500+


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blend Door Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Inability to control temperature or direct airflow (e.g., stuck on defrost).
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blend door actuator(s).
- **Cost:** $200 - $500


### Power Window Regulators
**Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows not operating, slow operation, or falling into the door.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the power window regulator and motor assembly.
- **Cost:** $250 - $500

### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chrysler Cirrus presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to center around the powertrain, particularly the 2.4L engine's susceptibility to head gasket problems and oil leaks, and the automatic transmission's potential for slipping or harsh shifting. Suspension components like ball joints and struts can also wear prematurely. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module or alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate, and interior components like HVAC blend doors and power window regulators are also known failure points. While not inherently unreliable, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and consider a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
