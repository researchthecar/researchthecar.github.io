The 2003 Chrysler Cirrus was a mid-size sedan offering comfortable transportation at an affordable price. It was available with three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Cirrus for its spacious interior and smooth ride, but criticized it for its reliability issues and somewhat bland styling.
