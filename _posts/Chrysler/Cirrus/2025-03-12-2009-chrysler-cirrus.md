The 2009 Chrysler Cirrus, also sold as the Sebring in some markets, was a mid-size sedan available in various trims. While appreciated for its affordability and spacious interior, it also had its share of issues. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 hp and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 producing 189 hp and 191 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 235 hp and 232 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L was typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.7L and 3.5L usually came with a 6-speed automatic. Owners often liked the comfortable ride and ample trunk space but disliked the somewhat dated styling and perceived build quality issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, leading to the need for frequent oil top-offs. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and addressing any leaks or worn valve stem seals. More serious cases may require piston ring replacement or engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors. Symptoms include rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of the misfire (spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors). Then replace as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6**

*   **Sludge Buildup/Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This engine is known for sludge buildup if oil changes are not performed regularly. This can lead to reduced oil flow, overheating, and eventually engine failure.
    *   Solution: Frequent oil changes with high-quality oil and filter. Engine flush treatments can sometimes help in milder cases. In severe cases, engine replacement or rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water pump failure can lead to overheating. Look for coolant leaks near the front of the engine and temperature gauge rising rapidly.
    *   Solution: Water pump replacement. It's often recommended to replace the timing chain at the same time, as the water pump is often driven by the timing chain in this engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report rough or jerky shifting, especially between gears. This can worsen over time.
    *   Solution: Begin with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.7L and 3.5L)**

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping can manifest as a delay in gear engagement, revving without acceleration, or difficulty maintaining speed.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter change might help. However, slipping often indicates internal wear and tear, potentially requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common symptoms include clunking noises over bumps, excessive bouncing, uneven tire wear, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the suspension system, replacing worn struts, shocks, control arms, ball joints, and tie rod ends as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls many electrical functions. Problems can manifest as fuel pump relay failure (leading to stalling or no-start conditions), intermittent starting, power window issues, lighting malfunctions, and other electrical gremlins.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm TIPM failure. Replacement of the TIPM is often the only solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can occur on the undercarriage, rocker panels, and other areas, especially in regions with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, patching, and repainting. Rust prevention treatments can help slow down future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks over time, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement is possible but costly. Options include dashboard covers or professional repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Chrysler Cirrus can be an affordable used car option, but it's essential to be aware of the potential problems. Engine issues, particularly with the 2.7L V6, can be severe and expensive to fix. Electrical problems related to the TIPM are also common and can be frustrating. Suspension wear is typical for a vehicle of this age. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the car, check its maintenance history, and be prepared for potential repairs.
