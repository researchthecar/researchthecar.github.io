The 2003 Chrysler PT Cruiser is a retro-styled, compact wagon that was popular for its unique design and versatility. Engine options included a 2.4L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing around 150 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, a 2.4L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 180-215 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L four-cylinder engine for the European market. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciated the PT Cruiser's cargo space and distinctive look. Common complaints included build quality issues, relatively poor fuel economy for its size, and some reliability concerns.
