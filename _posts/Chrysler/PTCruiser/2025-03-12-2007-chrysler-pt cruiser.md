The 2007 Chrysler PT Cruiser is a quirky, retro-styled wagon that offers a surprising amount of interior space and practicality. The base engine is a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. A turbocharged 2.4L inline-4, making 180 hp and 210 lb-ft of torque, was also available. The 2.4L turbo engine was standard on the GT trim. Both engines were offered with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the PT Cruiser's distinctive look and versatility, but it's often criticized for its lackluster fuel economy, dated interior, and some reliability concerns.
