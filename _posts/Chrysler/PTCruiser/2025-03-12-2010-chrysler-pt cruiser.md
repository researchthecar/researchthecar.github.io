The 2010 Chrysler PT Cruiser, a quirky and retro-styled compact wagon, offered a unique alternative to mainstream vehicles. While discontinued after this model year, it remains recognizable for its distinctive design. The 2010 PT Cruiser came standard with a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 engine producing 150 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. A higher-output turbocharged version of the 2.4L was also available, delivering 180 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some drivers liked the PT Cruiser's distinctive styling and practical cargo space. However, it was often criticized for its outdated platform, lackluster fuel economy, and questionable build quality. Common complaints revolved around reliability issues, cheap interior materials, and overall driving experience compared to newer competitors.
