### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chrysler PT Cruiser, while charming, exhibits common reliability concerns typical for its age and class. Key areas to monitor include potential oil and coolant leaks from the engine, particularly with the 2.4L variants, and transmission issues like harsh shifting or cooler line leaks in automatic models. Suspension components such as ball joints and strut mounts can wear out, leading to noise and handling problems. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or window regulators, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a significant issue depending on climate. Interior wear, especially on seats, and HVAC blend door failures are also noted. Despite these potential issues, many PT Cruisers remain on the road with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
