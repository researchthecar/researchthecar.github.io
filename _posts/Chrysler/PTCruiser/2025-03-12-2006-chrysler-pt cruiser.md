Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2006 Chrysler PT Cruiser, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2006 Chrysler PT Cruiser is a quirky, retro-styled compact car that was popular for its unique design and practicality. Engine options included a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 engine producing 150 hp and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 180 hp and 210 lb-ft of torque. The 2006 model year offered either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission depending on the engine. Some people liked the PT Cruiser's spacious interior, versatile cargo area, and distinctive look.
