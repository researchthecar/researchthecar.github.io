The 2004 Chrysler PT Cruiser is a retro-styled, front-wheel-drive compact car known for its distinctive design and surprising versatility. The 2004 model year offered several engine choices: a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing around 150 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque, a 2.4L Turbocharged inline-4 producing around 180 hp and 210 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L High Output Turbocharged inline-4 producing around 220 hp and 245 lb-ft of torque in the GT Model. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (available with the naturally aspirated and turbocharged engines) and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the PT Cruiser's unique look, cargo space, and relatively affordable price point. Common criticisms included its lackluster fuel economy, build quality issues, and somewhat dated driving dynamics.
