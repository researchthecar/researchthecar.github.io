The 2002 Chrysler PT Cruiser is a retro-styled compact car known for its unique appearance and relatively spacious interior. It came with two primary engine options: a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing around 150 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4L turbocharged inline-4 with 180 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. A 2.0L Inline 4 cylinder was available in other markets, but not in the United States. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. People generally liked the PT Cruiser for its distinctive styling, versatility, and affordability. Criticisms often centered on its somewhat lackluster fuel economy and build quality.

**Summary**

The 2002 Chrysler PT Cruiser is prone to several common issues, impacting its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical systems, interior, and exterior. Engine issues like crankshaft sensor failures and valve cover leaks, particularly in the naturally aspirated engine, can lead to drivability problems. Turbocharger-related issues are more common in the turbocharged version. Transmission problems, such as slipping and hard shifting, can be costly to address. Suspension issues, like strut mount and shock absorber failures, affect ride quality and handling. Electrical problems with power windows and instrument clusters can also be frustrating. Exterior rust, especially on the liftgate, is a concern, while interior issues like dashboard cracking and headliner sagging detract from the vehicle's appearance. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems when considering a 2002 PT Cruiser. The transmission, turbocharger and rust issues have the highest potential cost, while sensor and suspension work is more manageable for most people.
