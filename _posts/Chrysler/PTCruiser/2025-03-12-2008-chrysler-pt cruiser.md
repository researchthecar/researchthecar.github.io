The 2008 Chrysler PT Cruiser is a retro-styled, front-wheel-drive compact wagon that aimed to blend practicality with a unique aesthetic. Engine options included a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 150 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L turbocharged inline-4 producing 180 hp and 210 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic transmission were available depending on the engine and trim level. Owners often liked the PT Cruiser for its distinctive looks, relatively spacious interior for its size, and affordability. Common complaints revolved around its fuel economy, perceived lack of build quality, and engine reliability.
