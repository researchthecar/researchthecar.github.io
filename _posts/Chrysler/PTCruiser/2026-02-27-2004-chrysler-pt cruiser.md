### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chrysler PT Cruiser presents a unique styling choice but comes with a moderate reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the electrical system, particularly the Body Control Module and window regulators, as well as potential leaks within the engine's cooling and oil systems. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting in automatics and clutch wear in manuals, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear prematurely, and interior upholstery may show signs of age. While not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, prospective buyers should be aware of these recurring issues and factor in potential repair costs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble are key to managing the PT Cruiser's longevity.
