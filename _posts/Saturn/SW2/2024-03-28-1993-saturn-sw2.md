**Introduction:**

The 1993 Saturn SW2 is a compact station wagon that offers a spacious interior, good fuel economy, and a comfortable ride. It is available with two engine options: a 1.9L I4 and a 2.2L I4, both paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. The SW2 has received praise for its reliability, practicality, and value. However, it has also been known to experience some issues over the years.

**Engine**

**1.9L I4**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak. Symptoms include overheating, reduced engine performance, and a rough idle. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Exhaust Manifold Cracking:** The exhaust manifold can crack, causing a loud exhaust noise. The solution is to replace the exhaust manifold. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**2.2L I4**

* **Head Gasket Failure:** The head gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak. Symptoms include overheating, reduced engine performance, and a rough idle. The solution is to replace the head gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Transmission Fluid Leak:** The transmission fluid seal can fail, causing transmission fluid to leak. Symptoms include a low transmission fluid level and difficulty shifting gears. The solution is to replace the transmission fluid seal. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
* **Synchros Worn:** The synchronizers in the transmission can wear out over time, causing difficulty shifting gears. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mounts Worn:** The strut mounts can wear out over time, causing a clunking noise when driving over bumps. The solution is to replace the strut mounts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Ball Joints Worn:** The ball joints can wear out over time, causing a clunking noise when turning or braking. The solution is to replace the ball joints. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to not charge. Symptoms include a dim or flickering dashboard light and difficulty starting the car. The solution is to replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
* **Starter Solenoid Failure:** The starter solenoid can fail, causing the car to not start. Symptoms include a clicking noise when trying to start the car. The solution is to replace the starter solenoid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+

**Exterior**

* **Door Handles Break:** The door handles can break, making it difficult to open the doors. The solution is to replace the door handles. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ per handle

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking:** The dashboard can crack, especially on cars exposed to sunlight. The solution is to replace the dashboard. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Climate Control Knobs Break:** The climate control knobs can break, making it difficult to adjust the temperature. The solution is to replace the climate control knobs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+

**Summary:**

The 1993 Saturn SW2 is a reliable and practical vehicle that can experience some issues over time. The most common engine problems include intake manifold gasket failure and head gasket failure. Transmission issues include transmission fluid leaks and worn synchros. Suspension issues include worn strut mounts and ball joints. Electrical issues include alternator and starter solenoid failure. Exterior issues include broken door handles. Interior issues include dashboard cracking and climate control knobs breaking. Overall, the severity and cost of the issues are moderate, but some repairs, such as transmission rebuilds and head gasket replacements, can be expensive.
