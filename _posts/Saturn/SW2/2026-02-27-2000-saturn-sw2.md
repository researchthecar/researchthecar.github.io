### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Saturn SW2 is a generally reliable vehicle, but like many cars of its age, it can develop specific issues. Common problems tend to revolve around the engine's intake manifold gaskets and valve cover gaskets, as well as potential transmission issues, particularly with the automatic transmission, which can manifest as harsh shifting or leaks. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are also common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument clusters, can occur. Exterior rust, especially in the lower body panels, and interior issues like a failing HVAC blower motor are also noted. Despite these potential problems, the SW2 can be a cost-effective and practical choice if well-maintained, with most repairs being moderately priced.
