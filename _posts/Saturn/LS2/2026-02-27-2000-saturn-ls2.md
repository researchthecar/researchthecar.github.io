### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Saturn LS2, while offering a comfortable ride, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and manufacturing era. The most frequently reported issues revolve around the engine, particularly leaks from the intake manifold and oil pan gaskets, which can lead to overheating and performance degradation. Transmission problems, such as slipping gears and TCM failures, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and springs can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues.
