### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Saturn Relay presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to center around the powertrain, particularly the transmission's torque converter and solenoids, and engine components like intake manifold gaskets and EGR valves. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or power door mechanisms, are also noted. Suspension wear, especially ball joints and tie rods, is typical for a vehicle of this age and type. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential repair areas and budget accordingly for maintenance and unexpected fixes to keep the Relay running smoothly.
