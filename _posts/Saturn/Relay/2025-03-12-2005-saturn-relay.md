The 2005 Saturn Relay was a minivan offering seating for up to seven passengers. It was available with a 3.5L V6 engine, producing approximately 200 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Relay's spacious interior and relatively smooth ride. Criticisms commonly focused on its bland styling, perceived lack of refinement compared to competitors, and reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (LX9)**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine may run rough, have poor fuel economy, and the check engine light may illuminate. Coolant leaks are also possible.
    * Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of coolant, overheating, and a sweet smell emanating from the engine compartment.
    * Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak. Common culprits include water pump, radiator, hoses, and the aforementioned intake manifold gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the source and severity of the leak, ranging from $100 for a hose replacement to $800+ for a water pump or radiator replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4T65-E)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly. The transmission may make unusual noises.
    * Solution: This issue can stem from low transmission fluid, a faulty shift solenoid, or wear and tear within the transmission itself. A fluid flush and filter change might help in milder cases. Replacing faulty solenoids or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 for fluid flush and filter change, $200-$500+ for solenoid replacement, $2000 - $4000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll during turns, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace worn struts and shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per axle (front or rear) for parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Stabilizer Bar Links**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    * Solution: Replace the worn stabilizer bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per pair (front or rear) for parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Door Lock Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power door locks failing to operate properly, intermittent operation, or only working on some doors.
    * Solution: Could be a faulty door lock actuator, wiring issues, or a problem with the body control module (BCM). Replacing the faulty component is the fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door for actuator replacement; higher for wiring or BCM issues.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Windows may not roll up or down, or they may move slowly or erratically.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window for parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sliding doors becoming difficult to open or close, sticking, or making grinding noises. The power sliding door mechanism may fail.
    * Solution: Lubricate the tracks and rollers. Repair or replace damaged rollers, tracks, or the power sliding door motor/mechanism.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 for lubrication and minor adjustments; $200 - $800+ for roller/track replacement or power sliding door motor repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor only works on certain speeds, or not at all.
    * Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.

    * Recalls: None Found

* **Seatbelt Retractor Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Seatbelts retracting slowly or not at all, or becoming difficult to pull out.
    * Solution: Inspect the seatbelt mechanism for debris or damage. Clean or replace the seatbelt retractor assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per seatbelt for retractor replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Saturn Relay, while offering a spacious interior and decent ride, is prone to several issues, particularly with its engine, transmission, electrical system, and sliding doors. Repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing a blower motor resistor to more costly repairs such as transmission rebuilds or replacements. The severity of these issues and associated repair costs can make maintaining an older Relay a potentially expensive endeavor. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
