**Introduction:**

The 2007 Saturn Relay is a midsize minivan that was offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.2-liter four-cylinder that produced 144 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque. A 3.5-liter V6 engine was also available, which produced 200 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. The 2.2-liter engine was paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.5-liter engine was paired with a five-speed automatic transmission.

Owners of the Saturn Relay have reported a variety of issues with the vehicle, including:

**Engine**

**2.2-liter four-cylinder engine**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a loss of coolant and engine overheating. Symptoms include a check engine light, coolant leaks, and poor engine performance. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $600+

* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to skip. This can lead to catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, poor engine performance, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner. Estimated cost to fix: $800 - $1,200+

**3.5-liter V6 engine**

* **Intake valve carbon buildup:** Carbon buildup on the intake valves can reduce engine performance and fuel economy. Symptoms include a loss of power, poor fuel economy, and a rough idle. The solution is to clean the intake valves. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500+

**Transmission**

**Four-speed automatic transmission**

* **Torque converter clutch failure:** The torque converter clutch can fail, causing the transmission to slip and shudder. Symptoms include a loss of power, transmission slipping, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the torque converter clutch. Estimated cost to fix: $1,200 - $1,800+

**Five-speed automatic transmission**

* **Shift solenoid failure:** The shift solenoids can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or not shift at all. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, a check engine light, and transmission slipping. The solution is to replace the shift solenoids. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $600+

**Suspension**

* **Front strut failure:** The front struts can fail, causing the vehicle to bounce and handle poorly. Symptoms include a rough ride, poor handling, and a clunking noise from the front of the vehicle. The solution is to replace the front struts. Estimated cost to fix: $600 - $800+

* **Rear shock absorber failure:** The rear shock absorbers can fail, causing the vehicle to bounce and handle poorly. Symptoms include a rough ride, poor handling, and a clunking noise from the rear of the vehicle. The solution is to replace the rear shock absorbers. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $600+

**Electrical**

* **Battery failure:** The battery can fail, causing the vehicle to not start. Symptoms include a dead battery, a lack of power, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the battery. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200+

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to not charge. Symptoms include a dead battery, a lack of power, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the alternator. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $600+

**Exterior**

* **Rear liftgate latch failure:** The rear liftgate latch can fail, causing the liftgate to open unexpectedly. Symptoms include the liftgate opening on its own, difficulty closing the liftgate, and a rattling noise from the liftgate. The solution is to replace the rear liftgate latch. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+

* **Side mirror failure:** The side mirrors can fail, causing the mirror to wobble or fall off. Symptoms include a loose or wobbly side mirror, difficulty adjusting the side mirror, and a rattling noise from the side mirror. The solution is to replace the side mirror. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200+

**Interior**

* **Dashboard rattle:** The dashboard can rattle, causing a noise inside the vehicle. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the dashboard, a loose or wobbly dashboard, and a vibration from the dashboard. The solution is to tighten or replace the dashboard components that are causing the rattle. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $300+

* **HVAC blower motor failure:** The HVAC blower motor can fail, causing the air conditioning or heating system to not work. Symptoms include a lack of airflow from the vents, a squealing noise from the blower motor, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the HVAC blower motor. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+

**Summary:**

The 2007 Saturn Relay has a number of reported issues, including engine problems, transmission problems, suspension problems, electrical problems, exterior problems, and interior problems. The severity and cost of the issues vary depending on the specific issue. Some of the issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, while others can be more severe and expensive.
