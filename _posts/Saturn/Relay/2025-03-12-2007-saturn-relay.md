The 2007 Saturn Relay is a minivan known for its spacious interior and relatively affordable price point. Engine options for this model year included a 3.5L V6 engine producing 200 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque and a 3.9L V6 engine producing 240 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.
