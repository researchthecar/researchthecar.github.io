## Engine

### 2.4L Ecotec (LE5)
**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning between changes, potential for low oil levels.
- **Solution:** Engine internal inspection, piston ring replacement, or PCV system check.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500

**Timing Chain Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise from the front of the engine, especially on startup; check engine light.
- **Solution:** Timing chain and tensioner replacement.
- **Cost:** $700 - $1200


### 3.6L High Feature V6 (LLT)
**Timing Chain Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Severe rattling noise, engine stalling, check engine light with timing codes.
- **Solution:** Replacement of timing chains, guides, tensioners, and related components.
- **Cost:** $1500 - $2500

**Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Rough idle, P0010, P0011, P0014, P0015 codes, reduced engine power.
- **Solution:** Replacement of VVT actuators and solenoids.
- **Cost:** $500 - $900


## Transmission

### 6-Speed Automatic (AF23/AF30)
**Harsh Shifting / Slipping**
- **Symptoms:** Jerky gear changes, delayed engagement, slipping between gears, transmission warning light.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $400 - $2500

**Torque Converter Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Shuddering at low speeds, slipping, delayed acceleration.
- **Solution:** Torque converter replacement.
- **Cost:** $700 - $1300

### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Saturn Aura presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.4L Ecotec engine can suffer from oil consumption and timing chain issues, while the more powerful 3.6L V6 is prone to more significant timing chain and VVT problems. Automatic transmissions have also seen reports of harsh shifting and torque converter failures. Suspension components like strut mounts and control arm bushings are common wear items that can lead to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and infotainment system, are also noted. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be mindful of these powertrain and electrical concerns, as repairs can be costly. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these issues.
