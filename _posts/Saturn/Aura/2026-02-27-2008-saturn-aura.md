### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Saturn Aura presents a mixed reliability profile. The most significant concerns revolve around the powertrain, particularly the 3.6L V6 engine's timing chain issues and the automatic transmission's tendency for harsh shifting or slipping. The 2.4L engine can also experience oil consumption and timing chain problems, while the 2.0L turbo has potential turbocharger and PCV issues. Electrical components, such as the Body Control Module and alternator, have also been noted for premature failure. Interior issues are less common, with blend door actuators being a notable, albeit repairable, problem. Overall, while the Aura offers a comfortable and stylish package, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs, especially concerning the engine and transmission.
