**Introduction to the 2008 Saturn Aura**

The 2008 Saturn Aura was a midsize sedan powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 224 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. A 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine was initially offered but was discontinued in 2009. The Aura was available with a four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual transmission.

Drivers praised the Aura for its comfortable interior, responsive handling, and stylish design. However, it faced criticism for its lackluster engine performance and mediocre fuel economy.
