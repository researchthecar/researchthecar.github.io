### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Saturn Aura presents a mixed reliability profile. The most significant concerns revolve around the 3.6L V6 engine's timing chain issues and potential torque converter problems in the automatic transmission. While the 2.4L Ecotec and 2.0L Turbo engines have their own specific issues like oil leaks and turbo problems, they are generally less severe than the V6 timing chain concerns. Suspension components and some electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are also noted. Owners should be aware of these potential repair costs when considering this vehicle. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate some of these reliability challenges.
