The 2008 Saturn Aura was offered in several trims, each with varying engine options. The base engine was a 2.4L Ecotec Inline-4 producing 169 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. A step up was the 3.5L V6 producing 219 horsepower and 219 lb-ft of torque, and the top-of-the-line engine was a 3.6L V6 producing 252 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. The Aura was generally appreciated for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. However, it was often criticized for its somewhat bland styling and some reliability issues.

The 2008 Saturn Aura, while generally a comfortable sedan, is prone to a range of issues. The most concerning problems involve the engine (specifically timing chain issues in both the 2.4L and 3.6L engines) and transmission, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical problems, particularly with the ignition switch, are also a significant concern. Suspension and other interior/exterior issues, while less severe, can still contribute to overall ownership costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, budgeting accordingly for potential repairs.
