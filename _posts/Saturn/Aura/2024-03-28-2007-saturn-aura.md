**Introduction to the 2007 Saturn Aura**

The 2007 Saturn Aura was a mid-size sedan that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The standard engine was a 3.5-liter V6 that produced 224 horsepower and 218 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 3.6-liter V6 that produced 252 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission.

The Aura was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong V6 engines. However, it was also criticized for its bland styling, low fuel economy, and lack of features.
