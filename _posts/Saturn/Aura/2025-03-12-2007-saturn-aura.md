**Summary**

The 2007 Saturn Aura is a mixed bag. While praised for its styling and ride, it suffers from a number of reliability concerns. Engine issues like timing chain wear and oil consumption, along with transmission problems, can be costly to address. Electrical issues like the steering column lock can also be a significant headache. Rust can be an issue in areas where road salt is used. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of the issues varies, but some repairs can be expensive, potentially reaching several thousand dollars. A pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic is highly recommended.
