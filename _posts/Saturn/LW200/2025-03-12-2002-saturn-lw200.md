The 2002 Saturn LW200 is a mid-size wagon that offered a combination of practicality and affordability. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L V6 producing 182 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the LW200 for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency, but common complaints revolved around reliability issues and build quality.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some 2.2L Ecotec engines experienced high oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This could lead to engine damage if not monitored closely.
    * Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings or performing a valve job could mitigate the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner and guides in some 2.2L Ecotec engines were prone to wear, leading to rattling noises, poor performance, and potential engine damage if the chain jumped timing.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides is recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 3.0L V6 engine could develop coolant leaks from various locations, including the water pump, intake manifold gaskets, and head gaskets. Overheating could result.
    * Solution: Locate and repair the source of the leak by replacing the affected components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the source of the leak)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported harsh or erratic shifting, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Transmission slipping could also occur, particularly under load.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush may help in some cases. In more severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $2,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time, the struts and shocks on the LW200 could wear out, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks is recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (for all four corners)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Broken Sway Bar Links**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sway bar links are prone to breakage, which causes a rattling sound from the front when traveling over bumps.
    * Solution: Replace the sway bar links
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows were a common source of problems, with motors failing or regulators breaking.
    * Solution: Replacing the window motor or regulator is the common fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Instrument Cluster Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster could experience intermittent failures, with gauges ceasing to function or displaying incorrect readings.
    * Solution: Sometimes, resoldering connections on the circuit board can resolve the issue. Otherwise, replacement of the instrument cluster is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can form on the rocker panels, quarter panels, and around the wheel wells.
    * Solution: Minor rust can be sanded and repainted. Major rust will require panel replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Headliner Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The headliner material may start to sag or detach from the roof of the car.
    * Solution: Replace or re-glue the headliner.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

**Summary**
The 2002 Saturn LW200 has a history of reliability concerns, especially in the engine and electrical systems. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, issues like engine oil consumption and transmission problems can be costly to fix. Rust can also be an issue in some environments. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems and factor in potential repair costs.
