### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Saturn LW2 presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around aging components such as the engine's seals and gaskets, transmission solenoids and torque converters, and suspension wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, can also arise. Exterior concerns like rust and paint degradation are prevalent, especially on higher-mileage vehicles or those from harsher climates. Interior climate control and dashboard lighting can also be points of failure. While not inherently unreliable, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
