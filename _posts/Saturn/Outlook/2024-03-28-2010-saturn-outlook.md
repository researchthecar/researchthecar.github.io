**Summary:**

The 2010 Saturn Outlook has a range of issues that vary in severity and cost. The most common issues are related to the engine, transmission, and suspension. The 3.0L V6 engine is prone to oil leaks, timing chain tensioner failures, and excessive oil consumption, while the 6-speed automatic transmission may experience shuddering, hesitation, or slipping gears. The suspension can also suffer from worn strut mounts, sagging rear coil springs, and failed sway bar links. Some electrical issues, such as alternator and starter failures, have also been reported. The Outlook also has a few interior issues, including dashboard panel cracking and HVAC control malfunctions. While some of these issues can be relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more serious and costly to repair.
