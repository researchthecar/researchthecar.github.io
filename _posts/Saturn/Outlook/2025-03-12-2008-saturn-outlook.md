The 2008 Saturn Outlook is a full-size crossover SUV that offers a spacious interior and comfortable ride, making it a popular choice for families. It was available with a single engine option: a 3.6L High Feature V6 engine that produced around 270 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with an Aisin AFV 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and seating for up to eight passengers. However, some common complaints include issues with the timing chain, transmission problems, and electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**3.6L High Feature V6**

*   **Timing Chain Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illumination, and potential engine damage. The timing chain stretches over time, causing the engine timing to be off.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and possibly the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, stalling, rough idling, and check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replace the high pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin AFV 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Wave Plate Failure (3-5-R)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, loss of 3rd, 5th, or reverse gear. This is a common issue with the Aisin AFV transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the wave plate and potentially rebuild the transmission if damage is extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, rough shifting, transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Leveling System Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sags, the ride becomes bouncy, and the compressor motor may be constantly running or not running at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the air compressor and potentially the air springs if they are leaking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a few days, requiring frequent jump starts. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the parasitic draw by isolating the faulty component and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks may intermittently fail to lock or unlock, or may not work at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor only works on certain settings (e.g., high only) or doesn't work at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The liftgate struggles to stay open, slams shut, or is difficult to lift.
    *   Solution: Replace the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inadequate or no cold air coming from the vents. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, compressor failure, or a faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Recharge the refrigerant, replace the compressor, or replace the blend door actuator, depending on the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Saturn Outlook, while spacious and comfortable, is prone to several issues, particularly with the engine and transmission. Timing chain problems are a significant concern, leading to expensive repairs. Transmission failures, especially the wave plate, are also common and costly. Electrical gremlins and suspension issues add to the potential maintenance burden. Overall, owners should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly for repairs. The severity of the issues ranges from minor electrical glitches to major engine and transmission overhauls, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
