The 2007 Saturn Outlook was a full-size crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and car-like handling. All 2007 Outlooks were equipped with a 3.6L LY7 High Feature V6 engine producing approximately 270 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. A Hydra-Matic 6T75 6-speed automatic transmission was the only transmission option. Owners generally liked the Outlook for its passenger and cargo space, making it a good family vehicle. Common complaints included some reliability issues and lower-than-expected fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.6L LY7 High Feature V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive timing chain wear can lead to engine misfires, rough running, and illumination of the check engine light. The problem often stems from oil starvation, particularly if oil changes are neglected. Symptoms include a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chains, guides, and tensioners is usually required. Performing an engine flush may help prevent future issues if caught early.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water pump failure can cause engine overheating, coolant leaks, and potential engine damage. Look for coolant leaks near the water pump area and a temperature gauge reading that is higher than normal.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump. It is often recommended to replace the thermostat at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The high-pressure fuel pump has been known to fail prematurely. A failed HPFP will prevent the vehicle from starting, or will cause it to stall frequently and run poorly.
    *   Solution: The high-pressure fuel pump needs to be replaced, which requires removing the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Hydra-Matic 6T75 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Wave Plate Failure (3-5-R)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3-5-R wave plate inside the transmission is prone to cracking or breaking, leading to loss of 3rd and 5th gears, as well as reverse. This can cause the transmission to slip, shudder, or fail to shift correctly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the wave plate with an updated, stronger version. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary if the damage is extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension, particularly the coil springs, can sag over time, leading to a lower ride height in the rear and a less comfortable ride.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear coil springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the door lock actuators can prevent doors from locking or unlocking properly with the remote or door switch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate properly, often due to a failed window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The liftgate struts that hold the liftgate open can weaken and fail, causing the liftgate to fall unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no air conditioning output can be caused by a variety of issues, including a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a clogged evaporator.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause and repairing or replacing the faulty components. This could involve recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, or replacing other A/C components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,200+ depending on the issue
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **HVAC Actuator Failure**
     * Description/Symptoms: Clicking sounds from behind the dashboard, temperature inconsistencies, or failure to direct airflow properly are common indicators of a failing HVAC actuator. These actuators control the blend doors that regulate temperature and airflow distribution within the cabin.
     * Solution: Replacing the faulty HVAC actuator.
     * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the actuator and location
     * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Saturn Outlook can be a good family vehicle due to its space and comfort. However, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to the timing chain and transmission, as these can be costly to repair. Regular maintenance, especially frequent oil changes, is crucial to prolonging the life of the engine and transmission. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor electrical problems to major powertrain failures, with repair costs varying accordingly.
