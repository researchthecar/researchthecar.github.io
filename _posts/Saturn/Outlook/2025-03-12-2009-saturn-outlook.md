The 2009 Saturn Outlook is a full-size crossover SUV that offers seating for up to eight passengers. It was offered with a 3.6L V6 engine, producing approximately 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Outlook for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and relatively fuel-efficient V6 engine. Common complaints included issues with reliability, particularly concerning the timing chain and transmission.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or wear prematurely, leading to symptoms like a rough idle, misfires, engine noise (rattling or ticking), and a check engine light. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) such as P0008, P0016, P0017, P0018, or P0019 may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially the variable valve timing (VVT) actuators.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficult starting, long cranking times, or engine stalling. Check engine light with fuel pressure related codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Wave Plate Failure (3-5-R Clutch)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping, especially when shifting between 3rd, 5th, and reverse gears. Harsh or delayed shifting. Eventually, complete loss of those gears.
    *   Solution: Transmission removal and rebuild, including replacement of the damaged wave plate. Updated wave plates are available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at certain speeds, particularly under light acceleration. Transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, transmission damage may have occurred, requiring a rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Weakness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, especially when loaded with passengers or cargo. This can lead to a rougher ride and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shocks and springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more power windows failing to operate, or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor for the heating and air conditioning only working on certain speeds (e.g., only high), or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The liftgate (rear hatch) failing to stay open on its own, or slamming shut.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Saturn Outlook, while appreciated for its spaciousness and ride quality, has some notable reliability concerns. The most serious and costly issues revolve around the engine's timing chain and the transmission's wave plate and torque converter. Electrical issues like power window and blower motor failures are also common. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, making a thorough inspection and maintenance history check crucial before purchasing a used 2009 Saturn Outlook.
