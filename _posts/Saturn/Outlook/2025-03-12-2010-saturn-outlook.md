The 2010 Saturn Outlook is a full-size crossover SUV that offers seating for up to eight passengers. It was available with a 3.6L V6 engine producing around 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. People generally appreciated the Outlook's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and relatively stylish exterior. Common complaints included subpar fuel economy, some reliability issues, and the fact that the Saturn brand was discontinued shortly after this model year, which caused some concern about parts availability.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**
* **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 3.6L V6 engine is known for timing chain issues. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough running, engine noise (especially rattling at startup), and potential misfire codes. This is often due to oil degradation, which can accelerate wear on the timing chain components, especially the chain guides and tensioners.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chains, guides, and tensioners. Sometimes, the variable valve timing (VVT) solenoids also need replacement. Regular oil changes are critical to prevent this.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Causes engine to stall out while running, sputtering and poor acceleration.
    * Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Hydra-Matic 6T70)**

* **Wave Plate Failure (3-5-R Clutch)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 6T70 transmission, commonly paired with the 3.6L V6, is susceptible to wave plate failure within the 3-5-R clutch assembly. This leads to delayed or harsh shifting, especially between 3rd and 5th gears. You may also experience a loss of 3rd, 5th or reverse gears, or slipping during acceleration.
    * Solution: Full transmission rebuild or replacement is often recommended to address this issue comprehensively, as the failed wave plate can send debris throughout the transmission. Alternatively, you can replace the 3-5-R clutch assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ for rebuild/replacement. $1,000 - $2,000+ for clutch assembly replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes. Poor gas mileage. Transmission overheating.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter and flushing the transmission fluid is commonly recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Sag/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension, particularly the rear coil springs or the optional auto-leveling system (if equipped), can be prone to sagging or failure, especially with age and heavy use. This results in a lower rear ride height, reduced ride quality, and potentially accelerated tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs and/or shocks. If equipped with the auto-leveling system, the air shocks and compressor may require replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power window motors, especially in the front doors, are prone to failure. Symptoms include the window moving slowly, intermittently, or not at all.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ per window
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators are prone to failure. Doors may not lock or unlock with the remote, or the power lock switch on the door.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The gas struts that support the rear liftgate can weaken over time, causing the liftgate to fall down unexpectedly or not stay open on its own.
    * Solution: Replacement of the liftgate struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The AC system in the Outlook can experience issues such as refrigerant leaks, compressor failure, or blend door actuator problems, leading to weak or no cold air.
    * Solution: Leak repair, compressor replacement, or blend door actuator replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the problem, ranging from $200 for a refrigerant recharge to $1000+ for a compressor replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Saturn Outlook, while appreciated for its spaciousness and ride comfort, has some notable reliability concerns. The most significant and potentially costly issues relate to the engine's timing chains and the transmission's wave plate. Other problems, such as suspension sagging and electrical component failures, are less severe but still require attention. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and ensure that a thorough inspection is performed before purchasing a used Outlook.
