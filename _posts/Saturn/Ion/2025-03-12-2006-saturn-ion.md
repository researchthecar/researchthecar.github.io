The 2006 Saturn Ion was a compact car offered as a sedan or a coupe (Quad Coupe). Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec I4 producing 140 hp and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L Supercharged Ecotec I4 producing 205 hp and 200 lb-ft of torque (Red Line Only). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the Ion's fuel economy and relatively sporty handling (especially the Red Line). Common complaints included the cheap interior materials, unrefined engine, and quirky center-mounted gauges.

**Summary**

The 2006 Saturn Ion has a mix of minor and more significant issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the BCM and ignition switch (covered by a recall), can be frustrating and costly. Engine issues are relatively common, with the 2.0L supercharged version having expensive supercharger repairs as a possibility. Suspension components also tend to wear out. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission work or supercharger replacement, can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
