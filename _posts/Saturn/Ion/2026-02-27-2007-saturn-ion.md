### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Saturn Ion presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanical components can be durable with proper maintenance, specific issues are frequently reported. The Ecotec engines, particularly the naturally aspirated 2.4L, can suffer from oil consumption and timing chain problems, while the supercharged 2.0L may have belt-related concerns. Automatic transmissions can develop shifting issues over time. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and exterior paint degradation are also notable. Interior wear, especially on seats, is typical for a vehicle of this age and class. Overall, the Ion can be a cost-effective vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
