The 2007 Saturn Ion was a compact car offered in sedan and coupe (Quad Coupe) body styles. It was available with a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 engine producing 145 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciated the Ion's fuel efficiency and relatively spacious interior for its class. Common complaints included the car's cheap interior materials, unrefined ride, and somewhat awkward styling. The Quad Coupe's rear-hinged access doors were a distinctive feature, but not always universally liked.
