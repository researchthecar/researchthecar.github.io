The 2003 Saturn Ion was a compact car known for its unique features like dent-resistant polymer body panels and center-mounted gauges. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing around 140 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consisted of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Some owners appreciated the Ion's fuel efficiency and durable body panels, while others disliked the unconventional interior layout and reported various mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported the 2.2L Ecotec engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored. Symptoms included needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue exhaust smoke, and a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replacing piston rings or the entire engine can resolve the issue, though the solution's effectiveness varies.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
