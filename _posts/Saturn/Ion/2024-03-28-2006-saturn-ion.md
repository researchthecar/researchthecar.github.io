**Introduction:**

The 2006 Saturn Ion is a compact car that was available as a sedan, coupe, and quad coupe. It was equipped with a variety of engine and transmission options, including a 2.2-liter Ecotec inline-four engine with 145 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, a 2.4-liter Ecotec inline-four engine with 164 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, a 2.4-liter Ecotec inline-four engine with 170 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque, a 2.4-liter Ecotec inline-four engine with 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter LNF inline-four engine with 205 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. The Ion was offered with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

Owners of the Saturn Ion have reported issues with various components, including the engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, exterior, and interior.

**Engine**

* **2.2-liter Ecotec I-4**
    * **Oil consumption:** Excessive oil consumption can lead to engine damage. The issue is caused by worn piston rings. The solution is to replace the piston rings. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000-$2,000
    * **Timing chain failure:** The timing chain can stretch or break, which can cause the engine to lose timing. The solution is to replace the timing chain. Estimated cost to fix: $600-$1,200
* **2.4-liter Ecotec I-4 (164 hp)**
    * **Oil leak from VVT solenoid:** The VVT solenoid can develop a leak, which can cause oil to leak onto the engine. The solution is to replace the VVT solenoid. Estimated cost to fix: $300-$500
* **2.4-liter Ecotec I-4 (182 hp)**
    * **Knocking noise from engine:** A knocking noise from the engine can be caused by worn piston rings. The solution is to replace the piston rings. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000-$2,000
* **2.0-liter LNF I-4**
    * **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail, which can cause a loss of power. The solution is to replace the turbocharger. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500-$2,500

**Transmission**

* **Five-speed manual transmission**
    * **Grinding gears:** Grinding gears when shifting can be caused by worn synchronizers. The solution is to replace the synchronizers. Estimated cost to fix: $500-$1,000
* **Four-speed automatic transmission**
    * **Shifting problems:** The transmission may not shift smoothly or may refuse to shift into certain gears. The solution is to replace the transmission fluid and filter. Estimated cost to fix: $150-$250
