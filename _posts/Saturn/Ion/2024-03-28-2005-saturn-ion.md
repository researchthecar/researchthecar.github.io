**Introduction to the 2005 Saturn Ion**

The 2005 Saturn Ion is a compact car that was available in three trim levels: base, mid-level, and top-of-the-line. The Ion was powered by a 2.2-liter Ecotec four-cylinder engine that produced 160 horsepower and 169 pound-feet of torque and could be paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Ion was praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride, but it was also criticized for its poor handling, weak brakes, and lackluster interior.
