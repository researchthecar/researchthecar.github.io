The 2001 Saturn LW300 was part of Saturn's L-Series, a mid-size car intended to offer a blend of practicality and affordability. This model came with either a 2.2L Ecotec Inline-4 engine (140 hp, 150 lb-ft torque) or the 3.0L L81 V6 (182 hp, 190 lb-ft torque). Both engines were available with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Saturn's fuel efficiency and comfortable ride, but disliked the styling and some reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2001 Saturn LW300, particularly with the V6 engine, is prone to oil leaks, intake manifold gasket failure, and automatic transmission issues. The 2.2L Inline-4 is also known for timing chain and catalytic converter issues. Suspension and electrical problems, such as strut mount failure and ABS module failure, are also common. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds, can be costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in possible repair costs when considering this vehicle.
