The 2003 Saturn LW300 is a mid-size sedan known for its spacious interior and unique polymer body panels that resist dents and rust. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 and a 3.0L V6. The 3.0L V6 produced 182 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. It was praised for its comfortable ride, but criticized for its bland styling and less-than-stellar fuel economy with the V6. Common complaints included electrical issues and some mechanical problems, contributing to its mixed reputation.

**Summary**

The 2003 Saturn LW300, while appreciated for its dent-resistant panels and comfortable ride, suffers from a range of issues affecting various systems. The electrical problems (BCM and Instrument cluster) are common and can be frustrating to diagnose. Engine issues such as coolant leaks, timing chain problems (V6), and oil consumption (I4) can be costly. Suspension issues like strut mount failures are also fairly common. The severity and cost of repairs can vary, but addressing these potential issues is crucial for maintaining the vehicle's reliability and safety.
