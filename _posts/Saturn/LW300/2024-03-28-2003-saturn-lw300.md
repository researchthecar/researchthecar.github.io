**Introduction:**

The 2003 Saturn LW300 is a mid-size sedan that was available with two engine options and two transmission options. The base engine was a 2.2-liter inline-four that produced 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 3.0-liter V6 that produced 185 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.
