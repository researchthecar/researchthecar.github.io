The 2002 Saturn SC2 is a compact coupe known for its dent-resistant polymer body panels and relatively sporty handling. It came equipped with a 1.9L DOHC inline-four engine producing 124 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, and a four-speed automatic transmission was optional. Owners often appreciate the car's fuel economy and unique styling, while common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly electrical problems and oil consumption.

**Engine**

**1.9L DOHC Inline-Four**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes oil at a higher than normal rate, requiring frequent top-offs. This can be due to worn piston rings or valve stem seals. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings and/or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of coolant, overheating, and a sweet smell emanating from the engine bay. Common leak points include the water pump and radiator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty water pump or radiator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates to shift, shifts roughly, or slips out of gear. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn clutch packs, or a faulty valve body.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may temporarily alleviate the issue. However, a valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush/filter), $500 - $1,000 (valve body), $1,500 - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Five-Speed Manual**

*   **Grinding During Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding noise while shifting gears, particularly into 2nd or 3rd. This could indicate worn synchronizers.
    *   Solution: Replacing the synchronizers or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000 (for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can also lead to poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 per control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Instrument Cluster**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster, including speedometer, tachometer, and fuel gauge.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working or operate very slowly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Fog Light Housing Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks in the fog light housing, leading to moisture ingress and bulb failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the fog light assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per fog light
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaches from the roof and sags down.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headliner fabric or the entire headliner board.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Saturn SC2 is a somewhat unique vehicle with some specific issues. The most concerning issues are related to engine oil consumption and transmission problems. Electrical glitches and suspension wear are also fairly common. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. While the polymer body panels resist dents, the mechanical components require attention as the car ages.
