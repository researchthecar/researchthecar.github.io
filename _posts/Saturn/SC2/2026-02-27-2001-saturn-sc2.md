### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Saturn SC2 offers a unique blend of sporty styling and affordability. While its polymer body panels are distinctive, they can be prone to fading and cracking over time. Mechanically, the 1.9L engine is generally robust, but owners should be aware of potential intake manifold gasket leaks and oil leaks from the valve cover. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can include solenoid failures and torque converter problems. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods may require attention, and electrical gremlins stemming from the BCM or alternator failure are not uncommon. Overall, the SC2 can be a reliable car if well-maintained, but prospective buyers should inspect for these common issues.
