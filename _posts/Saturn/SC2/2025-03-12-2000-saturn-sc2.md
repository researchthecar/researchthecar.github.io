The 2000 Saturn SC2 is a compact coupe known for its dent-resistant polymer body panels and relatively fuel-efficient engine. The SC2 was equipped with a 1.9L DOHC Inline 4-cylinder engine producing approximately 124 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the car's affordability and unique styling, but common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly electrical and cooling system problems, and the somewhat basic interior.

**Engine**

**1.9L DOHC Inline 4-Cylinder**

*   **Coolant Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are a common issue, often stemming from the water pump, radiator, or various hoses. This can lead to overheating if not addressed. Visible coolant puddles under the vehicle and a low coolant warning light are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking component is the standard solution. A pressure test of the cooling system can help pinpoint the source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve cover gasket and oil pan gasket are prone to leaking over time. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, low oil levels, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $250+ per gasket depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Crankshaft Position Sensor, Oxygen Sensor)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: These sensors can fail, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, stalling, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can develop issues with harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or complete failure. This is often due to worn clutches or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush *may* temporarily alleviate minor issues, but a rebuild or replacement is often necessary for more severe problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (flush) - $1500-$3000+ (rebuild or replace).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**
* **Clutch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The clutch can wear out prematurely, leading to slipping, difficulty shifting, or complete failure to engage gears.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased braking distance.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ for a complete replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: These components can wear, causing loose steering, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows can fail due to worn motors, faulty switches, or broken regulators.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty motor, switch, or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, leading to a dead battery, dimming headlights, and other electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Grounding Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to age, corroded ground wires create erratic electrical behaviors. Lights flicker, gauges act incorrectly, and starting issues can occur.
    *   Solution: Clean and restore grounding points to bare metal, replacing damaged or corroded wires.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exterior door handles are known to break, especially in colder climates.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric can detach from the backing board and sag.
    *   Solution: Re-glue or replace the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Saturn SC2, while generally affordable and fuel-efficient, suffers from a number of common issues as it ages. Engine problems, particularly coolant and oil leaks, are relatively frequent. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can be more expensive to address. Suspension and electrical problems are also common, contributing to the overall maintenance cost. Repair costs range from relatively minor expenses for sensor replacements and gasket replacements to substantial costs for transmission rebuilds or replacements.
