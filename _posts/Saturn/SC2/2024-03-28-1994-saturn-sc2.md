**Summary**

The 1994 Saturn SC2 had some reliability concerns, particularly with engine head gaskets and transmission solenoids. The cost of repairs can be significant, especially for major issues like head gasket failure. While the SC2 offers low maintenance costs and unique plastic body panels, these issues may make it a less desirable option for those seeking a reliable vehicle.
