The 2001 Saturn SC2 is a sporty coupe known for its dent-resistant polymer body panels and relatively fuel-efficient engine. It came standard with a 1.9L DOHC inline-4 engine producing 124 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. Other engine option for the 2001 Saturn SC2 included a 1.9L SOHC engine which produced 100 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. The transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the car's distinctive look, peppy engine (especially the DOHC version), and easy handling. Common complaints include the relatively noisy engine, less-than-stellar interior quality, and some reliability concerns, particularly with age.

**Engine**

**1.9L DOHC Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to fouled spark plugs, catalytic converter damage, and eventual engine failure. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing piston rings, valve stem seals, or the entire engine may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of coolant, overheating, and white smoke from the exhaust. Often originates from the water pump, thermostat housing, or radiator.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking component(s). Thoroughly flush the cooling system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.9L SOHC Inline-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission shifts hard between gears, slips out of gear, or hesitates during acceleration. The "Check Engine" light may illuminate with transmission-related trouble codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission filter and fluid may provide a temporary fix. More serious issues might require rebuilding or replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll when cornering, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends. An alignment is required after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls intermittently, difficulty starting, and "Check Engine" light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows fail to operate, or operate intermittently. This is often due to a faulty window motor or switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust around body panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming around the metal part of the vehicle. Usually on the underbody, but can form around the doors and wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Cut out the rusted areas, and weld in new panels or patches. After patching, the area will need to be coated with primer and painted to match the vehicle color.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaches from the roof and sags down.
    *   Solution: Remove the old headliner and replace it with new fabric and adhesive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Saturn SC2, while generally reliable, exhibits some common issues, especially given its age. The most significant concerns revolve around excessive oil consumption in the DOHC engine and potential transmission problems in the automatic variant. Suspension wear is also common, but relatively inexpensive to address. Electrical issues like sensor failures and power window malfunctions can also occur. While some repairs are relatively minor, engine and transmission work can be costly. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
