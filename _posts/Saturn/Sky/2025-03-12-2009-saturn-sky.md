The 2009 Saturn Sky is a stylish roadster, known for its attractive design and sporty handling. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 177 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 generating 260 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Sky's head-turning looks and open-air driving experience. However, some common complaints include a somewhat cramped interior, limited trunk space, and concerns about reliability and parts availability due to Saturn's demise.
