### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Saturn Sky offers an attractive package for those seeking a sporty roadster. While its naturally aspirated 2.4L engine and manual transmission are generally robust, owners of the turbocharged 2.0L variant should be aware of potential turbocharger and PCV system issues. Automatic transmission owners may encounter shifting problems. Electrical components like window regulators and lighting can also be a source of concern. Exterior issues, particularly with the convertible top and paint, are not uncommon for a vehicle of this age and design. Overall, the Sky can be a reliable choice if well-maintained, with potential repair costs focused on the powertrain and electrical systems.
