### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Saturn Sky, while offering a fun driving experience, exhibits some common issues primarily related to oil leaks from the engine, potential VVT actuator problems, and wear on suspension components like ball joints and tie rods. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can manifest as harsh shifting. Electrical concerns include power window motor failures and fuel level sensor inaccuracies. The convertible top mechanism can also require attention. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these potential issues should be considered during ownership, with proactive maintenance and timely repairs being key to maintaining reliability.
