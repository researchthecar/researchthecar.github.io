The 2008 Saturn Sky is a sporty two-seat roadster that offers a fun driving experience. Two engine options were available: a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 177 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.0L Ecotec inline-4 producing 260 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (the Red Line trim). Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the car's stylish design, open-air driving experience, and (in Red Line form) the peppy turbocharged engine. Downsides often mentioned include limited storage space, a somewhat cramped interior, and some reliability concerns.
