The 2001 Saturn SL2 is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and dent-resistant polymer body panels. It primarily came equipped with a 1.9L DOHC inline-four engine producing 124 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the SL2 for its affordability and reliability; however, some dislike its somewhat bland styling and occasionally underpowered performance.

**Engine**

**1.9L DOHC Inline-Four**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage if not monitored and corrected. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve stem seals and piston rings can help reduce oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall or fail to start. The check engine light will likely illuminate, and a diagnostic code related to the crankshaft position sensor will be stored.
    *   Solution: Replacing the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, especially noticeable during acceleration and deceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid and filter is a low-cost solution that may help. A more expensive solution would be replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ or $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates or fails to engage properly when shifting gears. The engine may rev higher than normal without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: Complete transmission replacement, or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and reduced handling precision. The vehicle may bottom out over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Instrument Cluster**
    * Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster becomes dim, the gauges stop working, the cluster flashes, or the cluster stops working completely.
    * Solution: Replace or repair the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Headlight Switch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The headlights may fail to turn on, or they may flicker intermittently.
    * Solution: Replacing the headlight switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to go up or down or getting stuck, often attributed to a failing power window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Handle Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Both interior and exterior door handles, particularly the interior handles, are prone to breaking, making it difficult to open the doors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per handle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Saturn SL2, while appreciated for its durability and fuel efficiency, exhibits several common issues, particularly related to its engine, transmission, electrical system, suspension, interior, and exterior. Engine issues like oil consumption and crankshaft position sensor failure can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic transmission, are also prevalent and can be costly to fix. Electrical faults and worn suspension components contribute further to the overall maintenance burden. Interior parts are prone to breaking and may affect the usability of the vehicle. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission overhauls or engine work, can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing and maintenance considerations.
