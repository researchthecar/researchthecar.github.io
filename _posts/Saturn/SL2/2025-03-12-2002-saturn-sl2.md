The 2002 Saturn SL2 is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and dent-resistant polymer body panels. In 2002, the SL2 was only available with a 1.9L DOHC inline-four engine producing 124 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the car's affordability, simple design, and decent gas mileage. Common complaints include a somewhat noisy engine, basic interior, and some reliability concerns that come with an older vehicle.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust, especially upon startup.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, options range from using a higher viscosity oil, replacing valve stem seals, or, in more extreme cases, engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (oil change) - $2000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Catalytic Converter**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine light goes on (OBD code P0420), failed emissions test, rattling noise from underneath the car.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Summary**

The 2002 Saturn SL2, while appreciated for its affordability and unique body panels, can present several common issues related to its age and design. Engine problems such as oil consumption and catalytic converter failures are relatively common. Transmission issues like harsh shifting and slipping can also occur, especially in the automatic models. Suspension components are prone to wear and electrical problems can arise. Rust, especially on the underbody, is also a concern, depending on the climate where the car has spent its life. Costs to repair these issues can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to more substantial investments for engine or transmission work. Before purchasing, a thorough inspection is highly recommended.
