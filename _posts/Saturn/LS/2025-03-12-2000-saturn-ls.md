The 2000 Saturn LS was a mid-size sedan offering a more European driving experience compared to its domestic rivals. Engine options included a 2.2L inline-4 producing around 137 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing around 182 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Saturn's responsive handling and unique polymer body panels that resisted dents and rust. Common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the electrical and cooling systems.

The 2000 Saturn LS is plagued by several issues impacting reliability. Engine issues, such as coolant and oil leaks in the V6 and piston ring problems in the inline-4, are prevalent and can lead to costly repairs. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic transmission, are also common. Suspension components wear out, affecting ride quality and handling. Electrical issues such as faulty sensors and ignition switches are also common. Interior issues such as broken window regulators and cracked dashboards add to the list of potential problems. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs such as engine or transmission work can be quite costly, making the overall ownership experience potentially expensive.
