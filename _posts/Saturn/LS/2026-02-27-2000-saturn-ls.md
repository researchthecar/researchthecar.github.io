- **Solution:** Replacement of struts and shocks.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

**Ball Joint Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking or popping noises when turning, uneven tire wear, loose steering.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Malfunctioning power windows, door locks, interior lights, or dashboard indicators.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1200


### Alternator
**Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Dimming headlights, battery warning light, dead battery, electrical system malfunctions.

### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Saturn LS presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine (oil and coolant leaks, intake manifold gaskets on V6), transmission (slipping or harsh shifting), and suspension components like struts and ball joints. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, can also arise. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, and interior wear like dashboard cracking are also points to consider. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, potential buyers should be aware of these common problem areas and budget for potential repairs, especially on higher-mileage examples.
