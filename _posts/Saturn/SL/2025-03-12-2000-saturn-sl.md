The 2000 Saturn SL is a compact sedan known for its dent-resistant polymer body panels and fuel efficiency. The base engine option is a 1.9L SOHC 8-valve inline-4 engine producing around 100 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. A higher output 1.9L DOHC 16-valve inline-4 engine is also available which produces 124 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the car's affordability and simple design, but common complaints include engine issues related to oil consumption and issues with the automatic transmissions.

**Engine**

**1.9L SOHC 8-Valve I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience high oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs. This can be caused by worn piston rings or valve seals. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: A mechanic can perform a compression test and leak-down test to diagnose the source of the oil consumption. The solution may involve replacing the piston rings, valve seals, or, in severe cases, rebuilding the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.9L DOHC 16-Valve I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the SOHC engine, this engine is also reported to consume oil. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: As with the SOHC, diagnosis includes compression and leak-down tests. Repair involves replacing piston rings, valve seals, or engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to a rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup. If left unaddressed, this can cause the timing chain to skip, potentially leading to serious engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner and inspect the timing chain and guides for wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can develop issues such as harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly. These issues can be caused by worn transmission fluid, internal wear, or a faulty valve body.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required, potentially leading to a valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid/filter) - $2,500+ (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks can wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distance.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 (for a pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken/Worn Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The suspension springs can become broken or worn out causing a saggy ride and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken/worn springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 (for a pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor can fail, causing the engine to stall, run poorly, or not start at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Ignition Switch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ignition switch can fail leading to a no start condition or intermittent electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the ignition switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack due to sun exposure and age, particularly in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard (expensive) or install a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $1000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows can fail due to a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Saturn SL, while affordable and practical, is prone to certain issues, particularly with oil consumption and automatic transmission performance. Other less severe, but still notable, problems include suspension wear and electrical component failures. The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for sensors and suspension parts to several thousand for engine or transmission work, making it important to carefully inspect the vehicle before purchase and budget for potential repairs.
