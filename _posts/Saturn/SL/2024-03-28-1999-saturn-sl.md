## 1999 Saturn SL

The 1999 Saturn SL is a compact sedan that was offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 1.9-liter inline-four that produced 100 horsepower and 120 lb-ft of torque. A 2.2-liter inline-four that produced 124 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque was also available. Both engines could be paired with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The SL was praised for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and spacious interior. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power and its unrefined ride quality.
