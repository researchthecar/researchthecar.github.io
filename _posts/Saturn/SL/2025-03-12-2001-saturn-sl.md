The 2001 Saturn SL is a compact sedan known for its dent-resistant polymer body panels and fuel efficiency. It was offered with a 1.9L inline-four engine. The base SOHC engine produced 100 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, while the DOHC version delivered 124 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. Both were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the car's durability and affordability. Common complaints include the somewhat unrefined engine and potential reliability issues, especially as the car ages.

**Summary**

The 2001 Saturn SL, while praised for its fuel efficiency and dent-resistant panels, does suffer from common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues such as coolant and oil leaks, particularly in the intake manifold gasket and valve cover gasket areas, can lead to moderate repair costs. The automatic transmission is prone to slipping and hard shifting. Suspension components such as struts, shocks, ball joints, and tie rod ends wear out. Electrical issues like a faulty ignition switch and Check Engine Light can require diagnostics. The door handles are prone to breaking, and power windows may fail. Overall, while individual repair costs may vary, addressing these common issues can add up and should be factored into the ownership cost.
