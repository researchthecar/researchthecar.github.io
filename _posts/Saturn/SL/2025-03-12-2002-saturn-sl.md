The 2002 Saturn SL is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and dent-resistant polymer body panels. The base engine for the SL was a 2.2L Inline 4-cylinder engine producing approximately 100 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 124 horsepower version of the 2.2L engine was also available. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the car's practicality, affordability, and relatively low maintenance costs, but dislike its somewhat bland styling, basic interior, and limited performance compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2002 Saturn SL, while generally reliable, can suffer from a range of issues as it ages. The most common issues revolve around engine oil leaks, coolant leaks, transmission shifting problems, and suspension wear. Electrical gremlins with power windows and headlight issues can also occur. Interior issues, such as dashboard cracking and headliner sagging, are also common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more serious mechanical failures that can be costly to repair. Overall, the cost of repairs can vary widely, but some of the more significant repairs, such as transmission replacement or body panel work, can be quite expensive.
