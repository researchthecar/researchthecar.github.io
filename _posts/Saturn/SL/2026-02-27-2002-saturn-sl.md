### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Saturn SL is a basic compact car that, while economical to purchase, can present several common reliability concerns as it ages. Key areas to watch for include potential oil and coolant leaks from the 1.9L engines, and wear-and-tear items on the manual clutch or automatic transmission. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also common replacement items. Electrical issues, particularly related to the Body Control Module and alternator, can lead to frustrating problems. The unique polymer body panels, while resistant to rust, can suffer from cosmetic degradation over time. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in maintenance costs.
