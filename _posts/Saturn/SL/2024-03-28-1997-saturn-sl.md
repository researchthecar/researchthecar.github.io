## 1997 Saturn SL

The 1997 Saturn SL is a compact sedan available with two engine options: a 1.9-liter inline-4 and a 2.2-liter inline-4. The 1.9-liter engine produces 100 horsepower and 120 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.2-liter engine produces 124 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The SL has a reputation for reliability and fuel efficiency, but it has also been known to have some common issues.

**Engine**

**1.9-liter Inline-4**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include a rough idle, decreased engine performance, and coolant or oil leaks. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $600
* **Exhaust manifold gasket failure:** The exhaust manifold gasket can also fail, causing exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a loud exhaust noise and decreased engine performance. The solution is to replace the exhaust manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $300

**2.2-liter Inline-4**

* **No major issues found**

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual Transmission**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch can wear out over time, causing difficulty shifting gears or slipping. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, slipping gears, or a burning smell. The solution is to replace the clutch. Estimated cost to fix: $800 - $1,200
* **Transmission fluid leak:** The transmission fluid can leak from the transmission housing or seals. Symptoms include low transmission fluid levels and difficulty shifting gears. The solution is to identify and repair the source of the leak and replace the lost fluid. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500

**4-speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shift solenoid failure:** The shift solenoid can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or not shift at all. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, slipping gears, or no movement from the transmission. The solution is to replace the shift solenoid. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500

**Suspension**

* **No major issues found**

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to discharge and the vehicle to lose power. Symptoms include dim headlights, a dead battery, or a warning light on the dashboard. The solution is to replace the alternator. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $600
* **Battery failure:** The battery can fail due to age or a faulty charging system. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle, dim headlights, or a dead battery. The solution is to replace the battery. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200

**Exterior**

* **Door lock actuator failure:** The door lock actuator can fail, causing the door locks to not work properly. Symptoms include difficulty locking or unlocking the doors, or the doors locking or unlocking on their own. The solution is to replace the door lock actuator. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400
