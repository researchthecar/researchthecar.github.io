### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Saturn SL is a vehicle that, while economical to purchase, can present several common issues that require attention. Engine-related problems often involve gasket leaks and oil seepage, which are not uncommon for vehicles of this age. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can be costly if they escalate to internal component failure. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also wear items that may need replacement. Electrical gremlins, especially those related to the BCM and alternator, can be frustrating. The unique polymer exterior panels, while resistant to rust, can degrade over time. Interior components like the blower motor and power window regulators are also known failure points. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for managing the reliability of a 2000 Saturn SL.
