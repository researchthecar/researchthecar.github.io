The 2002 Saturn SC1 is a small coupe known for its fuel efficiency and dent-resistant polymer panels. It was available with a 1.9L inline-four engine, producing approximately 100 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the SC1's affordability and simple design, while common dislikes include its basic interior and somewhat unrefined driving experience.

**Summary**
The 2002 Saturn SC1, while a reliable and economical vehicle for its time, can suffer from a variety of issues related to its age. Engine problems such as oil consumption and coolant leaks are common, and the automatic transmission may experience shifting problems. Suspension components can wear out, and electrical issues can arise. Interior trim such as the headliner and dashboard are also prone to age-related problems. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission work, can be costly.
