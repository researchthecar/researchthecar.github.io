### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Saturn SC1, while offering a stylish package, exhibits common age-related issues. The 1.9L DOHC engine can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and general oil leaks.

Suspension components like struts, shocks, ball joints, and tie rods are common wear items that may need replacement. Electrical issues can include failing window regulators and instrument cluster problems. Externally, rust and clear coat degradation are prevalent. Internally, sagging headliners and HVAC blower motor failures are noted. Manual transmissions generally fare better. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs, especially concerning the powertrain and suspension, as the vehicle ages.
