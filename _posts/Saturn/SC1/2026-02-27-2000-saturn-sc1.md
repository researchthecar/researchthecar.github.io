### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Saturn SC1 is a car that can offer decent reliability if well-maintained, but it is not without its common issues. Owners frequently report problems with the automatic transmission, particularly slipping gears and torque converter issues. Engine-wise, intake manifold gasket leaks and valve cover gasket oil leaks are prevalent. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM failures and window regulator issues, can also arise. On the exterior, rust can be a concern on lower body panels, and interior dashboards are prone to cracking. While many of these issues are repairable, potential buyers should be aware of these common failure points and factor them into their purchase and maintenance considerations.
