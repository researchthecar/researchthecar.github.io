The 2000 Saturn SC1 is a small coupe known for its dent-resistant polymer body panels and fuel efficiency. The SC1, in particular, features a more sporty trim than the base SC model. Engine options for the 2000 SC1 include a 1.9L SOHC inline-four engine producing 100 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, or a 1.9L DOHC inline-four engine producing 124 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consist of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the SC1 for its affordability, easy handling, and unique styling. Common dislikes include a somewhat unrefined engine, basic interior, and limited rear seat space.

**Summary**

The 2000 Saturn SC1 has some common issues, mainly related to its age. Engine knocking, excessive oil consumption, and transmission problems are potential major concerns, with repair costs potentially reaching into the thousands for rebuilds. Suspension wear is typical for a vehicle of this age, but relatively inexpensive to address. Electrical gremlins and interior degradation are also common. While many of these issues are relatively minor, some can be costly to repair. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into the purchase price.
