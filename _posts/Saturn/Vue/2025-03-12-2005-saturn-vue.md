The 2005 Saturn Vue was available with several engine options: a 2.2L Ecotec Inline-4 producing 143 hp and 152 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L Honda-sourced V6 producing 250 hp and 242 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing 181 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (I4 only), a 4-speed automatic, and a CVT (I4 only, discontinued mid-year). Owners often appreciated the Vue's spacious interior and fuel efficiency (particularly with the 4-cylinder), but some disliked its bland styling and the CVT's performance.

**Summary**

The 2005 Saturn Vue has a range of potential issues depending on the engine and transmission configuration. The 2.2L Ecotec engine can suffer from oil consumption and timing chain problems. The Honda-sourced 3.5L V6 is generally reliable but may need valve adjustments. The V6 engines are paired with the 4-speed automatic transmission that can experience shifting issues. The CVT on the 2.2L is known to be unreliable. Suspension and electrical issues, along with rust, are also common. Repair costs can vary widely, from minor fixes to major engine or transmission work. The CVT is the most costly issue that can befall the vehicle.
