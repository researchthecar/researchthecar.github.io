### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Saturn Vue presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.4L Ecotec engine is prone to oil consumption and timing chain issues, while the 3.6L V6 also suffers from timing chain problems. The 3.5L V6 appears more robust. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4-speed, can experience harsh shifting or slipping. Suspension components like struts and ball joints may require replacement over time. Electrical issues such as battery drain and faulty window regulators are also noted. Interior concerns include HVAC blower motor failures and clogged sunroof drains. While not universally problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs, especially concerning the powertrain.
