The 2010 Saturn Vue, produced in the final year of the Saturn brand, offered a blend of practicality and comfort. Engine options included a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 169 hp and 161 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L V6 producing 257 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 producing 257 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic (with the 2.4L engine), and a 6-speed automatic (with the V6 engines). Owners often appreciated the Vue's spacious interior and comfortable ride, but some found the fuel economy lacking, particularly with the V6 engines. Reported reliability could be a concern for some owners, with some issues cropping up.

**Engine**

**2.4L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported higher-than-normal oil consumption. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil between changes and blue smoke from the exhaust.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to engine noise, poor performance, and potential engine damage. Symptoms can include a rattling sound, especially on startup, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners is the standard repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission may exhibit rough or delayed shifting, or even slip out of gear.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush might help in mild cases, but often requires a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (flush) / $1,500 - $3,500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with V6 engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6-speed transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh or abrupt shifts, especially between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Software updates may sometimes improve the issue, but valve body issues or internal damage may require more extensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (software update) / $500 - $2,500+ (valve body or rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride comfort, excessive bouncing after bumps, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ (for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Turn Signal Bulb Sockets**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turn signal bulbs burn out very frequently and the electrical contacts become corroded inside of the bulb socket causing a loss of electrical connection.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turn signal bulb socket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per light
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**

**Summary**

The 2010 Saturn Vue presents a mix of potential issues. Engine issues, particularly timing chain problems on the V6 models and oil consumption on the I4, can be relatively expensive to address. Transmission issues, especially rough shifting, are also a concern. Suspension and electrical problems are typical for a vehicle of this age. While some issues may be relatively minor, others could lead to significant repair costs. The severity and cost of these repairs underscore the importance of a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2010 Saturn Vue.
