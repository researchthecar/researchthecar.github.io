The 2009 Saturn Vue was available with a variety of engine options, including a 2.4L inline-4, a 3.5L V6, and a 3.6L V6. The 2.4L produced approximately 169 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciated the Vue's comfortable ride and spacious interior. Common complaints included build quality issues and some reliability concerns, particularly with certain engine and transmission combinations.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be indicated by the low oil pressure light illuminating or the engine running rough.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and addressing any leaks. A compression test may be needed to evaluate the condition of the piston rings. Some owners have reported that switching to a higher viscosity oil helped to slow down the consumption. Replacing the piston rings may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ for piston ring replacement depending on the shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to engine misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*No Issues Found*

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.4L, the 3.6L V6 can experience timing chain wear, leading to similar symptoms such as engine misfires, rough running, and a rattling noise. The check engine light may illuminate with codes related to timing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Generally Paired with 2.4L)**

*No Issues Found*

**6-Speed Automatic (Generally Paired with 3.5L & 3.6L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with harsh or erratic shifting, as well as slipping between gears. These issues may be more prevalent as the transmission ages.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may help in some cases. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement, or even a complete transmission rebuild, may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid/filter change. $500 - $1500 for valve body work. $2,500 - $4,500 for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the strut mounts, leading to clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts. Replacing the struts at the same time is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per pair (struts and mounts).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of one or more power window motors, resulting in the inability to raise or lower the affected window.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Stabilitrak/Traction Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Stabilitrak and/or traction control systems may intermittently activate or display error messages, potentially affecting vehicle handling. This can be caused by faulty wheel speed sensors or issues with the electronic stability control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause of the issue, which may involve scanning for diagnostic trouble codes. Repair or replacement of faulty wheel speed sensors or the electronic stability control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per wheel speed sensor. $500 - $1500+ for ESC module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the sunroof seal, potentially leading to water damage inside the cabin.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof seals. Replacing the sunroof seal or the entire sunroof assembly if necessary. Clearing the sunroof drain tubes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for seal cleaning/lubrication and drain cleaning. $200 - $500+ for seal replacement.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric may begin to sag or detach from the headliner board, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing or re-gluing the headliner fabric.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Saturn Vue has some potential issues that buyers should be aware of. The 2.4L engine is known to burn oil and have timing chain issues. The 3.6L engine is known to have timing chain issues. The 6-speed automatic transmission, particularly when paired with the V6 engines, can experience shifting problems. Other common problems include suspension strut mount failure, electrical issues with power windows and the Stabilitrak system, sunroof leaks, and headliner sagging. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, engine and transmission work can be costly. Pre-purchase inspections are recommended.
