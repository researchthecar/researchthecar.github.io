The 2008 Saturn Vue was a compact SUV offered with several engine and transmission choices. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4, a 3.5L V6, and a 3.6L V6. The 2.4L produced around 169 hp and 161 lb-ft of torque. The 3.5L V6 made around 222 hp and 219 lb-ft of torque. The 3.6L V6 made around 257 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciated the Vue's comfortable ride and spacious interior, while common complaints revolved around build quality and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Symptoms included low oil levels, potential engine knocking, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and topping off as needed. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the timing chain can occur. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup, check engine light with codes related to timing, and potential engine misfires or stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, sprockets, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report oil leaks from various locations, including valve cover gaskets and rear main seal. These leaks can lead to reduced oil levels and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**All Transmissions**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience harsh shifting or transmission slipping, particularly in higher mileage vehicles. This can be due to worn clutches or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change may alleviate minor issues. More significant problems may require valve body repair/replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front strut mounts are prone to failure, leading to clunking noises over bumps and compromised handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (for both sides)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**Summary**

The 2008 Saturn Vue presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine-related problems, particularly timing chain wear and oil consumption, can be costly to address, especially on the V6 models. Transmission issues, while less common, can also lead to expensive repairs. Suspension and electrical problems, like strut mount and power window failures, are relatively common and can add to the overall ownership cost. Rust is another concern, particularly in certain climates. While some issues are minor, others can be significant, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2008 Saturn Vue.
