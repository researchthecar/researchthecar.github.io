The 2002 Saturn Vue was the first SUV produced by Saturn, aiming to blend practicality with a more stylish and car-like driving experience. It offered two engine choices: a 2.2L L61 Inline-4 producing around 143 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L L81 V6 generating approximately 181 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The I4 was available with a 5-speed manual or a CVT, while the V6 was paired with a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciated the Vue's unique exterior styling and relatively spacious interior for its class. However, common complaints included unrefined engine options, build quality issues, and a somewhat lackluster driving experience compared to competitors.

**Summary**

The 2002 Saturn Vue presents owners with a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the I4 and timing chain issues in the V6, can lead to costly repairs. The CVT transmission, if equipped, is a significant concern due to its high failure rate. Suspension and electrical issues are also common, contributing to maintenance costs. Overall, the 2002 Saturn Vue can be an affordable SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs.
