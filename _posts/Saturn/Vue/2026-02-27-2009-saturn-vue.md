### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Saturn Vue presents a mixed reliability profile. While some owners report good experiences, common issues include oil leaks and timing chain problems with the Ecotec engines, and potential transmission issues like harsh shifting or solenoid failures. Suspension components like struts and bushings can wear out, leading to ride quality issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the Body Control Module and alternators, are also noted. Interior comfort can be affected by HVAC blend door actuator failures. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
