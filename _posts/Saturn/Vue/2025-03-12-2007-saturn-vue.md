The 2007 Saturn Vue was a compact SUV offered with several engine and transmission options. The base model came with a 2.2L Ecotec Inline-4 engine producing 143 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque. A 3.5L Honda-sourced V6 engine rated at 250 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, as well as a 3.6L GM-sourced V6 engine outputting 257 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque were also available. Transmission options varied depending on the engine and included 4-speed automatic, 5-speed automatic, and 6-speed automatic transmissions. Owners often praise the Vue for its comfortable ride and spacious interior, but some criticize its build quality and reliability.
