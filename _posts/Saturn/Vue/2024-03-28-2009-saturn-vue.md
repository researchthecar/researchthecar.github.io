**Introduction:**

The 2009 Saturn Vue is a mid-size SUV that was available with a range of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 164 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. A 3.5-liter V6 with 224 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque was optional. Both engines could be paired with a five-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission.

Drivers appreciate the Vue's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and versatile cargo space. However, it receives criticism for its lackluster performance, especially with the base engine, and its subpar fuel economy.
