### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Saturn Vue presents a mixed reliability profile. The Ecotec engines, while generally robust, can suffer from oil leaks and timing chain issues. The V6 option is more prone to intake manifold gasket problems. Transmission reliability varies significantly; the manual is quite solid, but the automatic and especially the CVT have documented issues with shifting, slipping, and overheating, which can be costly to repair. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can lead to frustrating and expensive repairs. Exterior rust can be a concern, especially in certain climates. Interior climate control actuators are a known weak point. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and consider the potential for ongoing maintenance and repair costs.
