The 2003 Saturn Vue was a compact SUV offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 143 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. A more powerful option was the 3.0L L61 V6 engine producing 181 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, exclusively paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Vue for its fuel economy (with the 4-cylinder), comfortable ride, and relatively spacious interior. Common complaints included the cheap interior materials, lackluster performance from the base engine, and some reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2003 Saturn Vue can be a decent vehicle, but it's important to be aware of the potential issues. Engine issues, particularly with the 2.2L Ecotec (oil consumption and timing chain), can be expensive to repair. The automatic transmissions (both 4-speed and 5-speed) can also be problematic, leading to costly rebuilds or replacements. Suspension and electrical issues are generally less severe and less expensive to fix. Overall, a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a 2003 Saturn Vue, and potential buyers should factor in the possibility of needing to address some of these common problems.
