### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Saturn Vue presents a mixed reliability profile. The Ecotec engine is generally robust but can suffer from common oil and coolant leaks. The Honda V6, while powerful, requires diligent maintenance, especially regarding the timing belt. CVT transmissions are a notable concern, with slipping and overheating being reported, often leading to significant repair costs. The 4-speed automatic is more conventional but can exhibit harsh shifting. Suspension components like struts and bushings are typical wear items. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can be costly. Exterior rust and interior wear are also points to consider. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, potential buyers should be aware of the specific powertrain and component vulnerabilities, especially the CVT.
