### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Saturn Vue presents a mixed reliability profile. Powertrain options, particularly the V6 engine and both automatic and CVT transmissions, have documented issues that can lead to significant repair costs if not addressed. Engine oil consumption and timing chain problems are notable concerns for the Ecotec and V6 engines, respectively. Transmission issues like harsh shifting or hesitation can also be costly. Suspension components like strut mounts and control arm bushings are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical issues such as faulty alternators and power window motors are also reported. While exterior and interior issues are less severe, sunroof leaks and HVAC blower motor problems can be inconvenient. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential mechanical and electrical vulnerabilities and factor in potential maintenance costs.
