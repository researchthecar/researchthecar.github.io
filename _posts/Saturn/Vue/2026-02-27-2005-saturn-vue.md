### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Saturn Vue presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.2L Ecotec engine is prone to oil leaks and timing chain issues, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmission problems, such as harsh shifting, are also a concern. On the suspension side, worn components like ball joints and bushings are common. Electrical issues, particularly with the Body Control Module and alternator, can lead to frustrating intermittent problems. Exterior rust, especially on wheel arches, and interior wear on seats are aesthetic and comfort concerns. The 3.5L V6 engine and manual transmission appear to be more robust. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these common problem areas and factor potential repair costs into their decision.
