### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Saturn Vue presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.2L Ecotec engine is prone to common issues like oil and coolant leaks, which require attention but are generally repairable. The 3.5L V6 appears more robust. Automatic transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, are a notable concern. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear out, leading to ride quality and steering issues. Electrical problems, particularly with window regulators and the instrument cluster, are also reported. Exterior rust can be an issue depending on climate. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
