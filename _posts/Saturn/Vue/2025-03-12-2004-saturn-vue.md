The 2004 Saturn Vue was a compact SUV offered with a few different powertrain options. The base engine was a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 143 hp and 152 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. A 3.5L Honda-sourced V6 producing 250 hp and 242 lb-ft of torque was also available, exclusively paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Uniquely, Saturn also offered a hybrid version called the Vue Green Line which featured a 2.2L Ecotec I4 paired with an electric motor to produce 143 hp and 129 lb-ft of torque combined. Owners generally appreciated the Vue's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. Common dislikes included perceived cheap interior materials, unrefined engine options (excluding the Honda V6), and some reliability concerns.

**Summary:**

The 2004 Saturn Vue can be a decent vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The severity of these issues ranges from minor electrical glitches to more serious engine and transmission problems. The costs associated with repairs can vary widely, but addressing potential issues proactively can help prevent more expensive repairs down the road. The 2.2L engine is more prone to timing chain and oil leak issues. The Honda-sourced V6 is fairly reliable but can have some expensive issues with the transmission. Rust is another common issue, particularly in areas with harsh winters. Overall, a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is recommended to assess the vehicle's condition and identify any potential problems. The hybrid model can have expensive battery replacement costs.
