### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Saturn Astra presents a mixed reliability profile. While its base 1.8L engine and manual transmission are generally robust, the turbocharged 2.0L engine can be prone to turbocharger issues and oil leaks. Automatic transmissions may experience harsh shifting. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts are common wear items. Electrically, window regulators and instrument clusters have been noted as potential failure points. Interior issues are less common, with HVAC blower motors being a notable concern. Overall, the Astra can be a reliable car if well-maintained, but owners should be aware of these specific potential repair areas, particularly concerning the turbocharged engine and automatic transmission.
