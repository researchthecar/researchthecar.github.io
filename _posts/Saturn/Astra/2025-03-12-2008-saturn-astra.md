The 2008 Saturn Astra was a compact car offered in two body styles: a three-door hatchback and a five-door hatchback. Both models came with a 1.8L inline-4 engine producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the Astra's European handling and distinctive styling. However, some common complaints included reliability issues, especially with the electrical system and the availability of parts due to Saturn's short lifespan and eventual discontinuation.

**Summary**

The 2008 Saturn Astra, while praised for its European handling and styling, suffers from a number of common issues that can affect its reliability. Engine-related problems like coolant and valve cover gasket leaks are relatively common and can lead to more serious engine damage if left unaddressed. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, can be costly to repair. Electrical problems, especially those related to the instrument panel and BCM, can be frustrating and expensive to diagnose and fix. While individual repair costs may vary, owners should be prepared for potential expenses related to these common issues. The cost and severity of these problems suggest potential buyers should get a pre-purchase inspection.
