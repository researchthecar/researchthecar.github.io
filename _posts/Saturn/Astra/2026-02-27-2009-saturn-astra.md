### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Saturn Astra presents a mixed reliability profile. While its European-tuned chassis and available turbocharged engine offer engaging driving, potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine-related problems like oil and coolant leaks are notable, particularly with the Ecotec engines. Transmission issues, especially with the manual gearbox's bearing wear and automatic transmission solenoid failures, require attention. Suspension components, such as control arm bushings, can wear prematurely, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, like failing window regulators and instrument clusters, are also reported. Despite these points, many Astras remain reliable with proper maintenance. Addressing these known issues proactively can significantly enhance the long-term ownership experience.
