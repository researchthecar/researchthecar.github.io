The 2009 Saturn Astra was offered as a compact hatchback available in both three-door and five-door configurations. All Astras came equipped with a 1.8-liter inline-four engine producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Astra's European-inspired handling and relatively spacious interior for its class. Common complaints include the availability of parts and the car's somewhat unrefined engine compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**1.8L Inline-Four (LWE)**

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are a common problem, often stemming from the thermostat housing or the water pump. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant leaks under the vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2009 Saturn Astra is a generally reliable vehicle, but it's not without its common problems. Engine and transmission issues are generally manageable and not catastrophically expensive, with coolant leaks and harsh shifting being among the more prevalent concerns. Suspension issues, particularly worn strut mounts and rear axle beam bushings, can impact ride quality and handling. Electrical issues like headlight bulb failures and ignition switch problems are also relatively common. Interior trim issues, while annoying, are generally minor and inexpensive to address. Considering the age of the vehicle, potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in the possibility of repairs when assessing its overall value. Parts availability can be a challenge.
