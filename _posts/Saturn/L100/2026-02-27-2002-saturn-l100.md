# 2002 Saturn L100

### Overview
The 2002 Saturn L100, part of GM's L-body platform, was designed as a compact to mid-size sedan and wagon. While offering a comfortable ride and decent practicality for its era, its reliability can be a mixed bag. Owners often report issues related to the powertrain, particularly with specific engine and transmission combinations. Electrical gremlins and interior wear are also noted concerns. However, the suspension generally holds up well, and exterior components are typically robust, barring age-related degradation. Prospective buyers should be aware of common failure points to budget for potential repairs.
