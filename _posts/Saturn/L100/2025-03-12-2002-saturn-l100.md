The 2002 Saturn L100 was a mid-size sedan offered by General Motors. It came standard with a 2.2L Inline-4 engine producing 135 horsepower and 142 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 3.0L V6 engine was available as an option producing 182 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciated the Saturn's dent-resistant polymer body panels and relatively spacious interior. However, some common complaints included uninspired styling, a somewhat rough-riding suspension, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2002 Saturn L100 faces a range of potential issues, from engine-related problems like timing chain and intake manifold gasket failures to transmission slippage and electrical gremlins. Suspension wear and interior trim problems are also commonly reported. The severity of these issues varies, but repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection to identify any potential problems.
