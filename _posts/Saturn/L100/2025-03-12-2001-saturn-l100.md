The 2001 Saturn L100 was a mid-size sedan offering a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy for its time. Engine options included a 2.2L inline-4 and a 3.0L V6. This guide focuses on the 2.2L inline-4, which produced around 135 horsepower and 142 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciated the L100 for its affordability and relatively spacious interior. Common complaints centered around reliability issues and overall build quality.

**Engine**

**2.2L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported the 2.2L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, sometimes requiring frequent top-offs. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, or low oil levels on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: The fix depends on the cause. It could involve replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. In severe cases, an engine rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+

*   **Check Engine Light - P0420 Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates with code P0420, indicating that the catalytic converter is not functioning efficiently. Symptoms can include reduced fuel economy and potential failure to pass emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter is the most common solution. Before replacing the catalytic converter, confirm the O2 sensors and fuel trims are operating correctly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Transmission**

**Automatic Transmission**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience erratic shifting patterns, where the transmission may hesitate to shift or shift harshly. Slipping can occur, where the engine revs up but the car does not accelerate properly.
    *   Solution: The issue could stem from low transmission fluid, a faulty valve body, or worn clutches. A transmission fluid flush and filter change might help, but a valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary in more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2500+

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased braking distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises coming from the front end, especially when going over bumps. Can cause vibrations.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

**Electrical**

*   **Dim Headlights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlights appear dim, reducing visibility at night. This could be due to corroded headlight connectors or a failing headlight switch.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the headlight connectors. If that doesn't solve the problem, replace the headlight switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working intermittently or completely. This is often due to a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
