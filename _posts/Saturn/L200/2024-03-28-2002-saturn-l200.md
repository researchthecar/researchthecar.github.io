**Introduction to the 2002 Saturn L200**
The 2002 Saturn L200 is a compact car that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. 
The base engine was a 2.2-liter inline-four that produced 140 horsepower and 150 pound-feet of torque. 
The optional engine was a 3.0-liter V6 that produced 185 horsepower and 205 pound-feet of torque. 
Both engines were available with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission. The L200 was praised for its comfortable ride and spacious interior, but it was criticized for its lack of power and poor fuel economy.
