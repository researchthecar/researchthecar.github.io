### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Saturn L200 presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly with the automatic transmission experiencing slipping or torque converter problems. Engine concerns like oil leaks and timing chain issues on the Ecotec engines are also noted. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM, can lead to frustrating intermittent problems. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also susceptible to wear. While the exterior can suffer from rust, and interior wear is typical for its age, these are often cosmetic or less critical. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
