### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Saturn L200, while offering a comfortable ride, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of vehicles from its era. Engine issues like oil leaks and timing chain problems on the 2.2L Ecotec, along with intake manifold leaks on the V6, are notable. Automatic transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting, are also reported. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, can be a source of frustration. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates, and interior components like HVAC blend doors and power window regulators are prone to failure. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs.
