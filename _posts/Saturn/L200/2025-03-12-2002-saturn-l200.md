The 2002 Saturn L200 was a mid-size sedan offered in several trim levels. It was known for its dent-resistant polymer panels and relatively spacious interior. However, it also garnered criticism for its unrefined engine, lackluster handling, and some reliability concerns. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec Inline-4 producing 135 horsepower and 142 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing 182 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough running, check engine light illuminated with codes related to the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Catalytic Converter**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated (likely with P0420 code), reduced engine performance, potential rattling sound from the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, coolant loss, overheating, check engine light illuminated.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, transmission slipping between gears, failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Typically requires a full transmission rebuild or replacement. A valve body issue could also be the cause, but less likely.

**Summary**

The 2002 Saturn L200 faces a mix of mechanical and electrical problems that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly with the crankshaft position sensor and intake manifold gaskets, can lead to performance problems and costly repairs. Transmission issues, especially erratic shifting, can be a major concern. Suspension components like struts and sway bar links wear out over time, impacting ride quality and handling. Electrical problems, like faulty window regulators, are common, while interior elements like headliners can degrade. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission overhauls, can be significant financial burdens. The overall reliability of the 2002 Saturn L200 can be a concern.
