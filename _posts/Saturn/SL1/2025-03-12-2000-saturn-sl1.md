The 2000 Saturn SL1 is a compact sedan known for its dent-resistant polymer body panels, fuel efficiency, and affordable price point. It was part of Saturn's effort to offer a different kind of American car, focusing on customer satisfaction. The SL1 came standard with a 1.9L SOHC 8-valve inline four-cylinder engine producing around 100 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful DOHC version was available in the SL2 model. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the car's durability and fuel economy, while some criticized its relatively low power, sometimes rough engine, and basic interior features.

**Engine**

**1.9L SOHC 8-Valve I4**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine runs rough, poor idle, check engine light illuminated (codes related to lean condition or misfires). Coolant loss might be observed if the leak is severe enough.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls, difficulty starting, check engine light illuminated (code P0335).
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay when shifting between gears, particularly from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd. Harsh engagement when shifting.
    *   Solution: Fluid change and filter replacement may alleviate the problem. In more severe cases, valve body issues or internal damage could necessitate a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $1500+ (rebuild/replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll during cornering, increased stopping distance, tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front suspension, loose steering, uneven tire wear, vibration at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard (battery light), difficulty starting, stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

    *   Solution: Replacement of the broken door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaches from the backing and begins to sag.
    *   Solution: Replace the headliner or re-glue the existing fabric.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400

**Summary**

The 2000 Saturn SL1, while appreciated for its fuel economy and dent-resistant panels, has common issues affecting its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical systems, interior and exterior components due to age and material degradation. Engine problems like intake manifold leaks and crankshaft position sensor failures can lead to drivability issues. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic variant, can cause shifting issues requiring costly repairs. Suspension wear and tear can affect ride quality and handling. Electrical issues with the alternator and ignition switch can cause starting and running problems. Headliner sagging and brittle door handles are common cosmetic issues. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively inexpensive fixes like sensor replacement to more costly repairs such as transmission rebuilds or suspension overhauls. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and consider the age of the vehicle.
