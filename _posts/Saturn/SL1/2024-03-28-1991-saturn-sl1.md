**1991 Saturn SL1**

The 1991 Saturn SL1 was a compact sedan that was praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and reliability. It was available with two engine options: a 1.9-liter inline-four that produced 85 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter inline-four that produced 110 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a standard five-speed manual transmission or an optional three-speed automatic transmission.

Despite its overall positive reputation, the 1991 Saturn SL1 had a few common issues that owners reported.

    - **Head Gasket Failure:** The head gasket could also fail, causing similar symptoms to intake manifold gasket failure. The repair was more complex and costly, ranging from $1,000 - $2,000+.
