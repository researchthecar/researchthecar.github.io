The 2002 Saturn SL1 is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It came standard with a 2.2L inline-4 engine producing around 100 horsepower and 120 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the SL1's simplicity and ease of maintenance, but common complaints revolve around reliability issues as the vehicles age. Some owners find the engine underpowered and the interior materials cheap.

**Engine**

**2.2L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the engine consuming large amounts of oil, often more than 1 quart per 1,000 miles. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and fouled spark plugs. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, solutions range from replacing valve stem seals and piston rings to a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light Due to EVAP System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, often accompanied by diagnostic trouble codes related to the evaporative emission control system (EVAP). This may be due to leaks in hoses, a faulty purge valve, or a failing gas cap.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause of the EVAP leak using a smoke test or scan tool. Replace faulty components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may stall intermittently, experience rough idling, or fail to start. Check engine light will likely illuminate with a code related to the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, shifts harshly, or fails to shift at all. This can be caused by worn-out clutches, low transmission fluid, or a faulty valve body.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is dark or smells burnt, a transmission flush and filter change may help. If the problem persists, a valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2500+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car stalls when put into drive or reverse, the transmission will not engage, or a shuddering sensation is felt.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, nose-diving during braking, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks. Consider replacing the strut mounts at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lopsided, clunking noises when driving over bumps, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken coil spring(s). It's recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2002 Saturn SL1, while economical, is prone to several issues related to its age. The most concerning are engine oil consumption and transmission problems, both of which can be expensive to repair. Suspension wear and electrical faults are also common. Rust, while not affecting all vehicles, can be a significant issue in certain climates. Overall, while the SL1 can be a cost-effective car, potential buyers should carefully inspect it for these common problems and factor in potential repair costs.
