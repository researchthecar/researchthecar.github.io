The 2004 Saturn L300 was a mid-size sedan that aimed to offer a blend of value and features. Engine options included a 2.2L Inline-4 producing 140 hp and 150 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L V6 engine which made 182 hp and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciated the car's spacious interior and comfortable ride, while others were less impressed with its somewhat bland styling and tendency for certain mechanical issues.
