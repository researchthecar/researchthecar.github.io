The 2003 Saturn L300 was a mid-size sedan intended to offer European-style handling and distinctive styling. Engine options included a 2.2L inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing 182 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciated its spacious interior and comfortable ride, while others disliked its unrefined engine and transmission, as well as some reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.2L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2.2L engines experience excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to replace the piston rings, however, this is only a temporary fix, and the issue will likely reappear down the line.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold gasket on the 3.0L V6 can fail, causing coolant leaks and potentially overheating. Symptoms include coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust (especially on startup), and an engine that runs rough.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gasket with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4T45E transmission can exhibit harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or complete failure. These issues are often attributed to worn valve bodies, or internal components.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the valve body or overhauling the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,800 - $3,500+ for rebuild or replacement, $500 - $1200 for valve body replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks can wear out prematurely, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The coil springs can break, leading to a sagging suspension, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the broken coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Summary**

The 2003 Saturn L300 is plagued by a number of reliability concerns, ranging from engine and transmission issues to electrical and interior problems. The most significant issues include excessive oil consumption in the 2.2L engine, intake manifold gasket failure in the 3.0L engine, and transmission problems in the 4-speed automatic. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the severity of the issue, but some repairs can be quite expensive.
