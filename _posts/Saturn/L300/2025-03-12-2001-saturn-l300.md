The 2001 Saturn L300 was intended to be a more upscale offering from Saturn, available as a sedan. Engine options included a 2.2L inline-4 engine producing 136 horsepower and 142 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine producing 182 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual (limited availability) or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
