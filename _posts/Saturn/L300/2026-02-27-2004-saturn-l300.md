### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Saturn L300 presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine's oil seals and timing components, particularly with the 2.2L Ecotec. Automatic transmissions can experience slipping or torque converter problems. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are also noted for wear. Electrically, the Body Control Module and alternator are potential failure points. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior components like HVAC blend doors and power window regulators are not immune to failure. While not a universally problematic vehicle, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas.
