### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Maserati Ghibli, while a desirable luxury vehicle, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of its performance-oriented nature and complex systems. The most frequently reported issues revolve around the engine, particularly oil leaks and turbocharger problems in the gasoline variants, and DPF/EGR issues in the diesel models. Transmission issues are less common but can include fluid leaks or software glitches. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are also noted.
