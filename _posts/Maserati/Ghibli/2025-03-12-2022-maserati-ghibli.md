The 2022 Maserati Ghibli is a luxury sedan that combines Italian styling with performance. Engine options include a 3.0L twin-turbo V6 producing either 345 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque or 424 horsepower and 428 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L twin-turbo V8 that produces 572 horsepower and 538 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Ghibli for its distinctive exhaust note, luxurious interior, and sporty handling. However, some criticisms include concerns about reliability, dated infotainment technology, and relatively high maintenance costs.
