The 2016 Maserati Ghibli is a luxury sedan that blends Italian styling with performance. It was offered with two engine options: a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 and a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 in a higher state of tune. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The base 3.0-liter V6 produced 345 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The higher-output version delivered 404 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. Many owners appreciate the Ghibli for its distinctive exhaust note, stylish design, and sporty handling. However, some criticisms include its reliability, build quality, and relatively dated infotainment system compared to its rivals.
