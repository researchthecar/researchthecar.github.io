Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2014 Maserati Ghibli, categorized by major component. The 2014 Ghibli marked Maserati's return to the mid-size executive sedan segment. Available engines included a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 producing either 345 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque or 404 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque (Ghibli S), and a 3.0-liter turbodiesel V6 in some markets. All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission (ZF 8HP). The Ghibli was praised for its stylish Italian design, sporty handling, and distinctive exhaust note. However, it also faced criticism for its reliability, build quality, and use of some Chrysler-sourced components within the interior.
