The 2007 Maserati Quattroporte is a luxury sedan known for its Italian styling, powerful engine, and luxurious interior. In 2007, the Quattroporte was primarily offered with a 4.2-liter V8 engine producing around 400 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission (ZF 6HP26). Some owners love the car's distinctive exhaust note, elegant design, and comfortable ride. Common complaints include high maintenance costs, electrical gremlins, and the sometimes-unreliable DuoSelect automated manual transmission offered in earlier model years. While the 2007 model mainly featured the automatic transmission, it's essential to differentiate potential issues arising from the engine and transmission, and other components of the car.
