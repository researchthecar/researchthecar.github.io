### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Maserati Quattroporte offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but it is not without its potential reliability concerns. Owners should anticipate potential issues primarily within the engine (turbochargers, coolant leaks), transmission (fluid leaks, shifting issues), and the advanced air suspension system (air spring leaks). Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, specific components like door handles and climate control can require attention. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for mitigating these risks and ensuring a more dependable ownership experience. Prospective buyers should factor in potential repair costs and prioritize vehicles with a well-documented service history.
