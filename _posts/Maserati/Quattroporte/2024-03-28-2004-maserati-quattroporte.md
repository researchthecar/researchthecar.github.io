The Quattroporte is known for its stylish design, spacious interior, and powerful engine. However, like all vehicles, it has its share of issues.

**Engine**

* **4.2L V8**
    * **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt can fail prematurely, leading to catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a loss of power, rough idle, and knocking noises. The solution is to replace the timing belt and any damaged components. Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    * **Valve Seat Recession:** Over time, the valve seats can wear down, allowing the valves to sink into the head. This can cause a loss of compression, misfires, and reduced performance. The solution is to replace the valve seats and valves. Estimated cost to fix: $4,000 - $6,000+

**Transmission**

* **6-Speed Automatic**
    * **Slipping:** The transmission may experience slipping gears or difficulty shifting. This is often caused by worn-out clutch packs or a faulty valve body. The solution is to rebuild the transmission or replace it. Estimated cost to fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    * **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter may fail, leading to a loss of power and shuddering. The solution is to replace the torque converter and any damaged components. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

**Suspension**

* **Front Control Arm Bushings:** The front control arm bushings can wear out, causing clunking noises and reduced stability. The solution is to replace the bushings. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+
* **Rear Shock Absorbers:** The rear shock absorbers can fail, leading to a rough ride and poor handling. The solution is to replace the shock absorbers. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery may drain prematurely due to a faulty alternator or parasitic draw. The solution is to replace the alternator or find and fix the parasitic draw. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $1,000+
* **Window Switch Failure:** The window switches may fail, preventing the windows from operating. The solution is to replace the window switches. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200+

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation:** Condensation may build up inside the headlights, reducing visibility. The solution is to replace the headlights. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Door Lock Failure:** The door locks may fail to operate due to faulty actuators or a damaged wiring harness. The solution is to replace the actuators or repair the wiring harness. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+

**Interior**

* **Navigation System Malfunction:** The navigation system may malfunction or become unresponsive. This is often caused by a software glitch or a faulty GPS module. The solution is to update the software or replace the GPS module. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $1,000+

**Summary**

The 2004 Maserati Quattroporte is a capable luxury sedan with a potent engine, but it is not without its issues. Some of the most common problems include timing belt failure, valve seat recession, transmission slipping, and front control arm bushing wear. The cost to fix these issues can be substantial, so it is important to factor this into your ownership decision.
