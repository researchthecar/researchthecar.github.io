The 2006 Maserati Quattroporte is a luxury sedan renowned for its Ferrari-derived engine, Italian styling, and luxurious interior. It came with a 4.2L naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. This engine was exclusively paired with a DuoSelect automated manual transmission. Owners appreciate the Quattroporte for its distinctive exhaust note, elegant design, and driving experience that sets it apart from more common luxury sedans. However, some common complaints include high maintenance costs, electrical gremlins, and the DuoSelect transmission's jerky operation at low speeds.
