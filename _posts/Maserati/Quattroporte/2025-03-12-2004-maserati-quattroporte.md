The 2004 Maserati Quattroporte marked the return of the legendary nameplate and brought Italian luxury and performance to the sedan market. The engine option available for this model year was a 4.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine that produced 394 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a DuoSelect automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the Quattroporte for its stunning design, luxurious interior, and distinctive Ferrari-derived engine sound.
