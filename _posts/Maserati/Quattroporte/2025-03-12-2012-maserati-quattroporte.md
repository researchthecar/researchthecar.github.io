The 2012 Maserati Quattroporte is a luxury sedan that blends Italian styling with performance. It was offered with two engine options: a 4.2-liter V8 producing 400 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.7-liter V8 generating 425-440 horsepower and 362-369 lb-ft of torque, depending on the trim.
