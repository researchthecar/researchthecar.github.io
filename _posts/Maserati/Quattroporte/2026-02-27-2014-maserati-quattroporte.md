### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Maserati Quattroporte is a high-performance luxury vehicle that demands a premium ownership experience, including higher maintenance and repair costs. While the core V6 and V8 engines are generally robust, potential issues with turbochargers and coolant leaks require attention. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission can experience shifting anomalies. Suspension components, particularly the adaptive system, are prone to leaks and wear. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and battery drain, are not uncommon. Exterior and interior components, while luxurious, can also present wear-related issues. Prospective buyers should budget for above-average maintenance and be prepared for potential repairs, especially as the vehicle ages.
