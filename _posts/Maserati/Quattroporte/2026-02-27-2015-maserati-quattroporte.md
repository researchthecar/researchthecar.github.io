### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Maserati Quattroporte offers a blend of performance and luxury, but its reliability requires careful consideration. Potential buyers should be prepared for the possibility of issues related to the twin-turbocharged engines, particularly with turbochargers and coolant systems. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, while generally robust, can experience shifting problems or torque converter issues. The adaptive suspension, a key feature, may develop leaks or wear in its components. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment system and keyless entry, are also noted. While the exterior and interior materials are generally well-regarded, specific components like the HVAC blower motor can fail. Regular, specialized maintenance is paramount to managing these potential reliability concerns.
