### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Maserati Quattroporte offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential owners should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair costs. Key areas to monitor include the twin-turbocharged engines (especially turbochargers and coolant systems), the ZF 8-speed automatic transmission (fluid leaks and shifting issues), and the adaptive air suspension (air spring leaks). Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, the Quattroporte demands attentive ownership and a budget that accounts for potential premium repair expenses. It's a car that rewards passionate drivers but requires a commitment to its upkeep.
