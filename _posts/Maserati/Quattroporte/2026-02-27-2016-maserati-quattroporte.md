### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Maserati Quattroporte offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but it is not without its potential reliability concerns. Owners should be prepared for possible issues related to the twin-turbocharged engines, particularly with turbochargers and coolant systems. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, while generally robust, can experience leaks or shifting anomalies. The adaptive suspension, a key feature, may require attention due to air suspension leaks or worn bushings. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment system, and minor exterior and interior component issues like door handles and climate control are also noted. While not as consistently reliable as some German luxury rivals, the Quattroporte's unique appeal and driving dynamics can outweigh these concerns for enthusiasts who prioritize style and performance and are willing to invest in diligent maintenance.
