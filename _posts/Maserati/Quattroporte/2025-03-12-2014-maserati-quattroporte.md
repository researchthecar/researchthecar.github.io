The 2014 Maserati Quattroporte is a luxury sedan that combines Italian styling with performance. For the 2014 model year, it came with three engine options: a 3.0-liter Twin-Turbo V6 producing 404 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque, a 3.8-liter Twin-Turbo V8 generating 523 horsepower and 524 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter Turbo Diesel V6 generating 271 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. The automatic transmission option is a ZF 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Quattroporte for its distinctive design, powerful engines, and luxurious interior. However, common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, higher maintenance costs, and the user-friendliness of the infotainment system.
