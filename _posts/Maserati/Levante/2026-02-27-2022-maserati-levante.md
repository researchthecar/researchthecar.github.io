### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Maserati Levante presents a mixed reliability profile. While the powertrain options, particularly the V6 and V8 engines, can be prone to issues like turbocharger problems and coolant leaks, and the air suspension system has documented concerns with leaks and compressor failures, other areas like the standard transmission and basic electrical components show fewer widespread problems. Owners should be aware of potential costs associated with the more complex systems, especially the performance-oriented engines and the air suspension. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential issues and ensuring the longevity of the vehicle.
