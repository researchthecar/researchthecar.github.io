### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Maserati Levante presents a mixed reliability profile. While its powerful engines and sophisticated transmission generally perform well, owners should be aware of potential issues with the air suspension system, particularly air spring leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted concerns. The V6 engine can experience turbocharger problems and oil leaks, though the V8 in the Trofeo model appears more robust in reported data. Addressing these potential issues proactively can help maintain the Levante's luxury and performance experience.
