The 2017 Maserati Levante marked Maserati's entry into the luxury SUV market. It offered a blend of Italian styling, performance, and exclusivity. While admired for its striking design, powerful engines, and sporty handling, it also faced criticism for its reliability, build quality, and electronic quirks. The Levante came with two engine options: a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 producing either 345 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, or 424 horsepower and 428 lb-ft of torque in the Levante S model. Both engines were paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Levante's unique character and driving experience, while others are disappointed by the frequency and cost of repairs.
