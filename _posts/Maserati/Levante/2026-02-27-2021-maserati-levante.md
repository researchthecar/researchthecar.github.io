### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Maserati Levante presents a mixed reliability profile. While the powertrain, particularly the V6 and V8 engines, can be robust, owners have reported issues such as oil leaks and turbocharger problems, with the V8 Trofeo occasionally experiencing overheating. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, while generally good, can sometimes exhibit hesitation or rough shifting. The air suspension system is a notable area for concern, with potential leaks in air springs and compressor failures leading to significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, also appear. Exterior and interior components are generally less problematic, though the unique pop-out door handles have seen some reports of sticking. Overall, the Levante requires diligent maintenance and awareness of its specific potential issues, especially concerning the air suspension and powertrain components.
