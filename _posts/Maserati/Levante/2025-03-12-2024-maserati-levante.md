The 2024 Maserati Levante is a luxury SUV that blends Italian style with performance. Engine options include a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 producing 345 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque in the base model and 424 horsepower and 428 lb-ft of torque in the Modena trim. A more powerful 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8, generating 572 horsepower and 538 lb-ft of torque, is available in the Trofeo trim. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Levante for its distinctive styling, luxurious interior, and engaging driving dynamics. However, some common criticisms include its reliability, infotainment system quirks, and relatively high maintenance costs compared to other luxury SUVs.

**Summary**

The 2024 Maserati Levante, while stylish and powerful, may present owners with a range of issues. Engine problems, particularly oil leaks and turbocharger issues with the V6 and potential cooling system concerns with the V8, can be costly to repair.
