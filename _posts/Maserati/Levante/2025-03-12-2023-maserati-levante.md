The 2023 Maserati Levante is a luxury SUV that blends Italian style with performance. Available engine options include a 3.0L twin-turbo V6 producing 345 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque (base model) or 424 hp and 428 lb-ft of torque (Modena trim), and a 3.8L twin-turbo V8 delivering 550 hp and 538 lb-ft of torque (Trofeo trim). All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Levante for its distinctive design, powerful engines, and sporty handling. However, common complaints often center around reliability issues, high maintenance costs, and a somewhat dated infotainment system compared to its competitors.
