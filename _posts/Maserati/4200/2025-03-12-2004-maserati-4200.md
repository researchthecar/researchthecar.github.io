The 2004 Maserati 4200, also known as the GranSport in later years, is a captivating Italian sports car known for its Ferrari-derived engine and luxurious interior. Powered by a 4.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine, it produces around 390 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque. The engine is known for its exhilarating sound and high-revving nature. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automated manual called "Cambiocorsa." People appreciate the 4200 for its distinctive styling, powerful engine, and the prestige associated with the Maserati brand. However, it has also been criticized for its high maintenance costs, the reliability of its Cambiocorsa transmission, and some electrical quirks.

**Engine**

**4.2L F136 V8**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon cold start, potential for catastrophic engine damage if the chain breaks. Can also cause the car to misfire.
    *   Solution: Replace timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Variator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased power, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace camshaft variators (often requires engine removal).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks from various engine seals and gaskets. Oil spots on the ground.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking gaskets and seals. Common areas include valve cover gaskets, timing cover gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on location of leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Cambiocorsa Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, clutch wear warning light. Cambiocorsa transmissions are notorious for rapid clutch wear, especially with aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Replace clutch, often including pilot bearing and throw-out bearing. The car is also highly dependent on proper calibration after the clutch install.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (including labor and calibration)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slow or erratic shifting, inability to select gears, transmission failure light. The Cambiocorsa system relies on a hydraulic pump to actuate the clutch and shift gears. The pump can fail due to age and wear.
    *   Solution: Replace hydraulic pump and potentially accumulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Actuator Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure to engage the gears, jerking, clunking, inability to shift gears. This could be one or more of the solenoids or sensors in the actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the actuator unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Skyhook Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking fluid from shocks, poor ride quality, clunking noises. The Skyhook system is an adaptive damping system and can be prone to failure with age.
    *   Solution: Replace Skyhook dampers (expensive). Alternative: Replace with aftermarket conventional dampers (less expensive but eliminates Skyhook functionality).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (for Skyhook replacement), $1,500 - $3,000 (for conventional replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, loose handling, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints (upper and lower).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on which ball joints need replacing)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures (Various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, other warning lights, erratic engine behavior. Common culprits include O2 sensors, mass airflow sensor, and crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per sensor, depending on location and type)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ECU Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent engine performance issues, failure to start, communication errors with diagnostic tools.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the ECU can be repaired or re-flashed. Otherwise, replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dim or failing displays, intermittent operation, incorrect readings.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door handles breaking or becoming difficult to operate. Often the plastic internals break.
    *   Solution: Replace door handles.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per handle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Buttons**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Interior plastic trim (especially buttons) becoming sticky and tacky due to the degradation of the coating.
    *   Solution: Cleaning with specific solvents or replacing the affected trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the extent of the problem and whether cleaning or replacement is chosen)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Shrinkage/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leather on the dashboard shrinking, pulling away from the edges, or cracking due to sun exposure and age.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the dashboard leather (expensive).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Maserati 4200 is a beautiful and exhilarating car, but potential buyers should be aware of the potential for significant maintenance costs. The most common issues revolve around the engine, transmission (especially the Cambiocorsa), suspension, and electrical systems. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousands of dollars for major overhauls. Pre-purchase inspections by a Maserati specialist are highly recommended. The Cambiocorsa is very expensive to repair if not maintained properly, with clutch replacements being very common. The Cambiocorsa transmission is known for being jerky and unrefined, so the manual transmission is often the more desirable option.
