### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Maserati Spyder is a desirable exotic car with a passionate following. Its reliability is a mixed bag, with the 3.2L V8 engine requiring diligent maintenance, particularly regarding its timing belt. The automated manual transmission (DuoSelect) is more prone to issues than the manual, with hydraulic and actuator problems being common. Suspension components like shock absorbers can wear out, and electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance costs and the need for specialized servicing. Overall, it's a car that rewards enthusiasts willing to invest in its upkeep.
