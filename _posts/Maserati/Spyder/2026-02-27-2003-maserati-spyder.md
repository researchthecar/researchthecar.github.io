### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Maserati Spyder is a desirable exotic sports car, but its ownership experience is characterized by higher maintenance costs and a greater likelihood of encountering specific, non-wear-and-tear related issues compared to more common luxury vehicles. Key areas to monitor include the engine's timing belt and potential oil leaks, the DuoSelect transmission's hydraulic system, and the convertible top's mechanical and electrical components. While the V8 engine is generally robust, its maintenance is critical. Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are also possibilities. Prospective buyers should budget for potential repairs and ensure a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a specialist familiar with Italian exotics.
