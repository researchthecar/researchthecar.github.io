The 2005 Maserati Spyder is a luxurious Italian convertible known for its beautiful design, exotic engine note, and open-top driving experience. It features a 4.2-liter V8 engine producing around 390 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual and a six-speed automated manual transmission (Cambiocorsa) were available. Owners appreciate the Spyder for its distinctive styling, powerful engine, and the prestige associated with the Maserati brand.
