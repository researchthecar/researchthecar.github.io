The 2010 Maserati GranTurismo is a luxury grand tourer known for its stunning Italian design, powerful engine, and luxurious interior. The 2010 model year primarily features a 4.7-liter V8 engine producing around 405 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. Some models, like the GranTurismo S, offer an even more potent version of the same engine. This engine is paired with either a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed automated manual transmission (DuoSelect). Owners love the car's exhilarating performance, distinctive exhaust note, and head-turning aesthetics. However, common complaints include high maintenance costs, electrical gremlins, and the sometimes-unreliable automated manual transmission.

**Engine**

**4.7L V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, often originating from valve cover gaskets, timing chain cover, or the oil pan. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty gaskets or seals. Thoroughly cleaning the affected area after the repair is crucial to ensure proper sealing and to detect any potential re-leaks early on.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioners can wear, causing the timing chain to stretch. Symptoms include a rattling noise on start-up, rough idling, and potential loss of power. If left unaddressed, this can lead to serious engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, especially during downshifts. Can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body issues may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automated Manual (DuoSelect)**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automated manual transmission uses a clutch that wears down over time. Symptoms include slipping during acceleration, difficulty engaging gears, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is necessary. This typically involves replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing. Ensure the automated system is properly calibrated after installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DuoSelect system relies on a hydraulic pump to actuate the clutch and gear changes. The pump can fail, leading to transmission failure or inability to shift gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump. Some owners choose to replace the accumulator at the same time, as it is also a wear item.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Skyhook Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with the Skyhook adaptive suspension can experience issues with the dampers. Symptoms include a harsh ride, knocking noises, and uneven handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty dampers. Skyhook dampers are expensive, so this can be a costly repair. Some owners opt to replace the Skyhook system with a conventional suspension setup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The control arm bushings can wear out, resulting in play in the suspension. Symptoms include clunking noises, especially over bumps, and vague steering feel.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings. Replacing the entire control arm assembly may be necessary if the bushings cannot be pressed in and out easily.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors can fail, causing warning lights to illuminate on the dashboard. Common culprits include oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and crankshaft position sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car can experience excessive battery drain, especially when left sitting for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the drain, which could be a faulty module, aftermarket accessory, or simply an aging battery. Parasitic draw tests can help pinpoint the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the bulbs or electrical components.

**Summary**

The 2010 Maserati GranTurismo, while beautiful and exciting to drive, is prone to several issues that can lead to high ownership costs. Engine oil leaks and timing chain problems are potentially serious and expensive. Transmission issues, particularly with the DuoSelect automated manual, can also be costly. Electrical problems and suspension issues add to the list of potential headaches. Buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs. A thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
