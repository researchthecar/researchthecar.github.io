The 2019 Maserati GranTurismo is a grand tourer known for its stunning Italian styling, powerful engine, and luxurious interior. This model year marked the end of the GranTurismo's production run, making it a potentially desirable collector's item. The 2019 GranTurismo features a 4.7-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 454 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car's exhaust note, elegant design, and comfortable ride. However, criticisms frequently include the outdated infotainment system, relatively poor fuel economy, and high running costs.

**Engine**

**4.7L V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently than normal and blue smoke from the exhaust, especially after startup.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the issue may be related to worn valve stem seals or piston rings. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source. Depending on the severity, the solution can range from using a higher viscosity oil to a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the timing chain. Symptoms include rattling noises, especially upon start-up, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. It's recommended to replace all related components as a set.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have noted harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. Some have also reported slipping or hesitation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Begin with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, valve body issues or worn clutch packs may be the cause, necessitating a rebuild or replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Skyhook Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The GranTurismo's adaptive "Skyhook" suspension can experience issues with the electronic dampers. Symptoms may include a rough ride, uneven handling, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific damper or sensor that is failing using diagnostic tools. Replace the faulty damper(s) and recalibrate the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system is known for being outdated and prone to glitches. This can include freezing, screen blackouts, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation errors.
    * Solution: Try a system reset or software update, if available. If the issues persist, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the vehicle, such as those related to the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), parking sensors, and airbag system, can fail. This can trigger warning lights and potentially impact system functionality.
    *   Solution: Identify the faulty sensor using diagnostic tools and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor

    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause of the issue, which may involve inspecting hydraulic lines, cylinders, sensors, or the top's latching mechanism. Repair or replace the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a sticky or tacky feel to certain interior trim pieces, particularly those made of plastic or coated with a soft-touch material. This is often due to the material degrading over time.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly clean the affected areas with a mild cleaner specifically designed for automotive interiors. For severe cases, the trim piece may need to be replaced or refinished.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Maserati GranTurismo, while a beautiful and desirable grand tourer, can present some notable issues to potential owners. The engine, particularly the potential for high oil consumption and timing chain concerns, is a point to watch. Transmission issues, electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and sensors, and suspension problems can contribute to higher maintenance costs. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing thousands of dollars, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential.
