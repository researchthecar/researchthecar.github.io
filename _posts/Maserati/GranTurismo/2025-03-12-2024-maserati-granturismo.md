The 2024 Maserati GranTurismo marks a significant return for the iconic grand tourer. Available with a range of powerful engine options and a focus on Italian design and luxury, the GranTurismo aims to blend performance and comfort. Engine choices include the Nettuno V6 engine in varying states of tune and a fully electric powertrain for the GranTurismo Folgore. The Nettuno engine is a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 that produces 483 hp in the Modena configuration and 542 hp in the Trofeo configuration. Torque figures are equally impressive, providing strong acceleration and a responsive driving experience. The fully electric Folgore, which replaces the traditional engine with three 300 kW electric motors, boasts over 750 hp and all-wheel drive. Power is routed through an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GranTurismo for its striking aesthetics, exhilarating performance, and luxurious interior. However, potential downsides can include reliability concerns, high maintenance costs, and complex electronics, which can sometimes lead to issues.

**Summary**

The 2024 Maserati GranTurismo, while offering stunning design and performance, presents some potential issues. Engine problems, especially turbocharger failure and oil leaks in the Nettuno V6, can be costly. Transmission issues such as harsh shifting could be early indicators of valve body failure. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system, seem to be recurring. Suspension issues, especially air suspension failure, can also be expensive to address. While not every GranTurismo will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and factor them into their purchasing decision, especially considering the higher repair costs associated with luxury vehicles.
