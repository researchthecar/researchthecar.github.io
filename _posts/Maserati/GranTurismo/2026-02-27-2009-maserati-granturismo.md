### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Maserati GranTurismo is a desirable exotic car with a passionate following. While its V8 engines are generally robust, owners should anticipate potential issues related to camshaft/lifter wear and oil seals, particularly as mileage increases. The ZF automatic transmission, while generally reliable, can experience torque converter or mechatronic unit problems. The adaptive suspension, a key feature, can be a source of expensive repairs if shock absorbers or sensors fail. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment and body control modules, are not uncommon in vehicles of this era and complexity. Exterior and interior components, while aesthetically pleasing, may require more diligent care to prevent premature wear. Prospective buyers should factor in the higher cost of specialized maintenance and repairs associated with a luxury Italian performance vehicle.
