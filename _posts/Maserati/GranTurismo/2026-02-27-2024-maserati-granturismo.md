# 2024 Maserati GranTurismo

### Overview
The 2024 Maserati GranTurismo represents a significant evolution for the iconic Italian grand tourer, blending performance, luxury, and cutting-edge technology. As a new model year, particularly with a redesigned platform and powertrain options, initial reliability data is still emerging. However, Maserati's recent efforts to improve build quality and component longevity are expected to carry over. The GranTurismo is offered with potent V6 Nettuno engines and an all-electric Folgore variant, each with distinct engineering considerations. Early reports suggest a focus on refined driving dynamics and a premium interior experience. While comprehensive long-term reliability data will take time to accumulate, the initial outlook for the 2024 GranTurismo is cautiously optimistic, with a strong emphasis on performance and luxury.
