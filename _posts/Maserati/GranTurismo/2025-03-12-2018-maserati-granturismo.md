The 2018 Maserati GranTurismo is a luxury grand tourer known for its stunning Italian design, powerful engine, and distinctive exhaust note. This model year features the 4.7L naturally aspirated V8 engine, producing 454 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option is a 6-speed automatic. While owners often praise the car's aesthetics and exhilarating driving experience, common complaints revolve around reliability, dated infotainment system, and high maintenance costs. The infotainment system is the most common complaint about the vehicle, and the car is known to have other electrical issues.
