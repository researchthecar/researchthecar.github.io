The 2017 Maserati GranTurismo is a luxurious and stylish grand tourer known for its stunning Italian design, powerful engine, and distinctive exhaust note. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. While owners appreciate the car's performance and aesthetics, some common complaints revolve around reliability, maintenance costs, and outdated technology.
