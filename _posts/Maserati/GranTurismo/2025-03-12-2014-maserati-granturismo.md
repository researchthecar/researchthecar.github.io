The 2014 Maserati GranTurismo is a stylish and luxurious grand tourer, powered by a naturally aspirated 4.7-liter V8 engine. The engine produced 454 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. All GranTurismos from this year were equipped with a ZF 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car's striking Italian design, the intoxicating exhaust note of the V8, and the comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include the high cost of maintenance and repairs, the dated infotainment system, and some reliability concerns.
