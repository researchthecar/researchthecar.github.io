The 2015 Maserati GranTurismo is a luxurious and sporty coupe/convertible known for its distinctive Italian styling and powerful performance. The heart of the GranTurismo is a naturally aspirated 4.7-liter V8 engine, producing around 454 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a ZF 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GranTurismo for its exhaust note, elegant design, and comfortable ride. However, some common criticisms include its outdated infotainment system, relatively poor fuel economy, and higher maintenance costs compared to other luxury cars.
