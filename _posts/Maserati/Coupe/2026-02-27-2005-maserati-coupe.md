### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Maserati Coupe is a performance-oriented vehicle that demands diligent maintenance. Key areas of concern include the V8 engines, particularly regarding timing chain tensioners and potential oil leaks, and the automated manual transmission's hydraulic system and actuators. Suspension components, especially on models with the Skyhook system, can also be a source of costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and battery drain, are not uncommon. While interior wear is typical for its age, mechanical and electrical issues are more prevalent than in less performance-focused vehicles. Prospective buyers should budget for higher-than-average maintenance and repair costs and ensure a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a marque specialist.
