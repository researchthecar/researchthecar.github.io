**Summary**

The 2003 Maserati Coupe, while visually stunning and offering a thrilling driving experience, is plagued by a variety of issues that can be both costly and frustrating to address. Engine oil and coolant leaks, along with variable valve timing problems, are common concerns. The Cambiocorsa transmission is particularly notorious for its high maintenance demands and the potential for expensive repairs related to the clutch, hydraulic pump, and actuators. Suspension issues with the Skyhook system and electrical problems due to sensor failures and wiring harness degradation further add to the ownership challenges. Sticky interior trim and failing navigation systems also detract from the overall ownership experience. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate to severe, and the cumulative cost of repairs can be substantial, potentially exceeding several thousand dollars annually for a well-maintained example. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decisions.
