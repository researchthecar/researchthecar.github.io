The 2007 Maserati Coupe is a beautiful and sporty Italian grand tourer powered by a Ferrari-derived 4.2-liter V8 engine. This engine produced around 400 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque. It was generally praised for its exotic sound and responsive performance. The Coupe came with a choice of two transmissions: a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed DuoSelect automated manual transmission. People often loved the styling, the engine sound, and the exclusivity of the Maserati Coupe. However, they often disliked the high maintenance costs, the quirky electronics, and the sometimes-unreliable DuoSelect transmission.

**Engine**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets, most commonly the valve cover gaskets or rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the location of the leak and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The variators (variable valve timing) can develop issues, leading to rattling noises, especially at startup. This can affect engine performance and fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the variators and potentially associated components like the timing chains.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed DuoSelect Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear and Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DuoSelect transmission is known for its clutch wear. Symptoms include jerky shifting, slipping, difficulty engaging gears, and eventually complete clutch failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch and potentially the throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ due to the complexity of the system and the need for specialized tools and knowledge.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DuoSelect transmission relies on a hydraulic pump to operate the gear changes. This pump can fail, leading to a complete loss of gear selection or erratic shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the hydraulic pump and potentially the associated hydraulic fluid and accumulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ per shock, depending on the shop and parts availability.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as the mass airflow sensor or oxygen sensors, can fail, leading to poor engine performance, fault codes, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the sensor and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Maserati Coupe, while a desirable vehicle, is prone to several issues that can be both costly and frustrating to address. Engine oil leaks and variator issues are common, and the DuoSelect transmission is particularly known for its clutch wear and potential hydraulic failures. Electrical issues with sensors and ECUs are also prevalent. While the manual transmission is generally more reliable, the potential for high repair bills across the board makes thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic essential before buying a 2007 Maserati Coupe.
