The 2023 Maserati Grecale is a compact luxury SUV positioned as a smaller, more accessible alternative to the Levante. It offers a blend of Italian design, performance, and technology. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder mild-hybrid engine producing either 296 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque in the GT trim or 325 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque in the Modena trim, and a high-performance 3.0L twin-turbo V6 producing 523 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque in the Trofeo trim. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Grecale's stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and luxurious interior. Some common dislikes include the infotainment system's complexity and occasional software glitches, as well as the higher price point compared to some competitors.

* **Mild-Hybrid System Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Issues with the 48V mild-hybrid system, resulting in error messages related to the auxiliary battery or the belt starter generator (BSG). Symptoms may include reduced performance, failure of the start/stop system, or difficulty starting the engine.
    * Solution: Replacement of the BSG unit or the 48V battery. Software updates to the mild-hybrid system control module have also been used.
