Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2024 Maserati Grecale, categorized by component and engine/transmission option. Please note that as a relatively new model, long-term reliability data is still emerging, and some issues may be less prevalent.

The 2024 Maserati Grecale is a luxury compact SUV that blends Italian styling with performance. Available engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder mild-hybrid engine (producing around 296 hp and 332 lb-ft of torque) and a more powerful 3.0L twin-turbo V6 (Netuno engine) that delivers approximately 523 hp and 457 lb-ft of torque in the Trofeo trim. All Grecale models use an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Grecale's attractive design, engaging driving dynamics, and luxurious interior. Criticisms tend to center on its infotainment system, reliability concerns, and price point relative to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder Mild-Hybrid**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing hesitation or stalling, particularly during acceleration from a stop or at low speeds. This may be due to the mild-hybrid system integration or software glitches.
    *   Solution: Software update/reprogramming of the engine control unit (ECU) and mild-hybrid system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200 (if covered under warranty; otherwise, cost will depend on the dealershipâ€™s labor rates and diagnostic procedures).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Twin-Turbo V6 (Netuno)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of higher-than-expected oil consumption between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels frequently and top off as needed. If consumption is deemed excessive, a dealer inspection and potential engine component replacement (piston rings, valve seals) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (monitoring); $500 - $5,000+ (for component replacement, depending on the extent of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP50/8HP75)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Jerky Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifts, particularly during low-speed driving or when shifting between certain gears. This could be related to the transmission's adaptive learning or software issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission control unit (TCU) reprogramming or software update to refine shift patterns. A transmission fluid flush and filter change may also improve shift quality. In severe cases, valve body replacement could be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200 (software update); $300 - $500 (fluid flush); $1,000 - $3,000+ (valve body replacement, if needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found
