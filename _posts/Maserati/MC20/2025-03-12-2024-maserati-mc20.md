The 2024 Maserati MC20 is a mid-engine sports car that has generated excitement for its performance and design. Powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine, known as the "Nettuno," it delivers 621 horsepower and 538 lb-ft of torque. A DCT 8-speed transmission is the sole transmission option. Drivers generally praise the MC20 for its striking looks, exhilarating acceleration, and relatively lightweight construction. Some criticisms include infotainment system usability, limited storage space, and certain interior materials feeling less premium than expected for its price point.
