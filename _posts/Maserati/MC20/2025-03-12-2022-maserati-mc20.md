The 2022 Maserati MC20 is a mid-engine sports car that marks a significant return for Maserati to the supercar segment. It's powered by a potent 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine, known as the "Nettuno," producing 621 horsepower and 538 lb-ft of torque. All MC20s come exclusively with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the MC20 for its striking design, impressive performance, and engaging driving dynamics. However, some criticisms include limited practicality, infotainment system quirks, and the potential for high running costs associated with a high-performance vehicle. Below is a breakdown of commonly reported issues:
