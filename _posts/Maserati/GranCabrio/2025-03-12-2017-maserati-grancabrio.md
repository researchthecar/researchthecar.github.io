The 2017 Maserati GranCabrio is a luxury convertible known for its stunning Italian design, powerful engine, and exhilarating driving experience. Powered by a 4.7-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 454 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, paired with a ZF 6-speed automatic transmission, it offers a blend of performance and elegance. While owners appreciate the GranCabrio's distinctive styling and exhaust note, common complaints include higher-than-average maintenance costs, infotainment system glitches, and some reliability concerns. The GranCabrio offers an emotive driving experience but necessitates a thorough pre-purchase inspection and diligent maintenance.

**Engine**

**4.7L V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and timing chain cover. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal. Cleaning the affected area to ensure no oil residue remains.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the source and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the timing chain tensioners, potentially leading to timing chain slack and engine damage. Symptoms can include rattling noises from the engine, especially on startup, and potential engine misfires or rough running.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioners and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and if valve work is required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 6HP26 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or harsh gear changes, hesitation during shifting, or slipping between gears. Can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may provide a temporary fix. However, valve body rebuild or replacement is often necessary. In severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Skyhook Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electronically adjustable Skyhook suspension can experience failures, leading to a loss of damping control, uneven ride height, and error messages on the dashboard. Malfunctioning struts or sensors are common culprits.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the faulty component (strut, sensor, control module). Replacement of the defective part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ per strut, plus labor and diagnostic fees.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can be prone to glitches, including freezing, slow response times, and Bluetooth connectivity issues. Screen blackouts and navigation errors have also been reported.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, replacement of the infotainment system head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $2,000+ (head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the car is not driven regularly. Can be caused by parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Repair or replacement of the faulty component. Ensuring the battery is properly maintained and charged when the car is stored.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (battery replacement) - $500+ (diagnosis and repair of parasitic draw).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The convertible top mechanism can experience problems, including slow operation, complete failure to open or close, and leaks around the seals. Malfunctioning hydraulic pumps or sensors are often the cause.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty component (pump, sensor, hydraulic lines). Repair or replacement of the defective part. Adjustment and lubrication of the mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Buttons**
    * Description/Symptoms: Certain interior buttons and switchgear can become sticky or tacky over time, particularly in warmer climates. This is due to the degradation of the soft-touch coating.
    * Solution: Professional cleaning with specialized products designed to remove the sticky residue or replacement of the affected components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cleaning) - $500+ (replacement of individual components).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Maserati GranCabrio, while a visually appealing and engaging vehicle, can present owners with a range of potential issues. Engine oil leaks and timing chain concerns are notable for their potential severity and cost. Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system, and convertible top malfunctions can also be frustrating. While some issues can be addressed with relatively minor repairs, others can be quite expensive due to the complexity of the vehicle and the cost of parts. A thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Maserati technician is highly recommended, and potential owners should budget for ongoing maintenance and repairs.
