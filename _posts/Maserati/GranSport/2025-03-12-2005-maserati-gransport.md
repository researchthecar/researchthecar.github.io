The 2005 Maserati GranSport is a performance-focused version of the Maserati Coupe, featuring a 4.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque. It was only available with a six-speed semi-automatic transmission (Cambiocorsa). Owners often praise the GranSport for its stunning Italian design, exhilarating engine sound, and sharp handling. Criticisms commonly center around high maintenance costs, electrical quirks, and the somewhat jerky nature of the Cambiocorsa transmission at low speeds.
