The 2006 Maserati GranSport is a performance-oriented coupe and convertible featuring a Ferrari-derived 4.2-liter V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque. It was only available with a 6-speed automated manual transmission, often referred to as the Cambiocorsa or F1 transmission. Owners often praise the GranSport for its exotic styling, powerful engine, and engaging driving experience. Common complaints include high maintenance costs, quirky electronics, and the somewhat temperamental nature of the automated manual transmission.

**Engine**

**4.2L V8 (F136 R)**

* **Camshaft Variator Failure (Variator Actuator)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise on startup, rough idling, loss of power, and potentially a check engine light. The issue stems from wear and tear within the variator actuator units themselves.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft variator(s). Often both variators are replaced at the same time to avoid future repairs, as well as an oil change.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (parts and labor depending on if one or both need to be replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks from various engine seals and gaskets. Common areas include the valve cover gaskets, timing chain cover, and rear main seal. Can cause low oil level and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn or damaged seals and gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the location and complexity of the leak)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible coolant leaks from radiator hoses, water pump, thermostat housing, or the radiator itself. Can cause overheating and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn or damaged coolant components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ (depending on the location and complexity of the leak)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Cambiocorsa (Automated Manual)**

* **Clutch Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, jerky shifts, and eventual inability to move. The Cambiocorsa is essentially a manual transmission that is shifted via a computer/hydraulic system. The clutch itself is prone to wear, especially with aggressive driving or improper use.
    * Solution: Clutch replacement. The clutch assembly includes the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. It is often recommended to replace the pilot bearing and resurface the flywheel at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (parts and labor, including SD3 computer diagnostics)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hydraulic Pump Failure (F1 Pump)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The F1 pump provides hydraulic pressure to the transmission for shifting. Failure can result in the inability to shift gears, a warning light on the dashboard, and a loss of hydraulic pressure. The pump itself can fail, or the relay or accumulator associated with the system can malfunction.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty hydraulic pump, relay, or accumulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (parts and labor, including system bleeding and calibration)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Gear Position Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, incorrect gear display, or the transmission getting stuck in a particular gear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty gear position sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Skyhook Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: If equipped with the Skyhook adaptive suspension, issues can arise with the dampers (shock absorbers). Symptoms include a rough ride, clunking noises, and uneven handling. The Skyhook system uses electronically controlled dampers to adjust damping force based on road conditions.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty damper(s). It is often recommended to replace dampers in pairs (front or rear) to maintain balanced handling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the number of dampers being replaced and whether OEM or aftermarket parts are used)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Ball Joint/Control Arm Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints and/or control arms.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the location and extent of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights (ABS, TPMS, etc.) and performance issues due to faulty sensors. Common culprits include ABS sensors, oxygen sensors, and crankshaft position sensors.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty sensor and replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per sensor, including diagnosis and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Dashboard Display Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Pixelation or complete failure of the dashboard display screen. This can affect the display of important information such as speed, fuel level, and warning lights.
    * Solution: Replacement or repair of the dashboard display unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not in use. Can be caused by a faulty electrical component that is drawing power even when the car is off.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the source of the battery drain and repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Fog Light Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Fog lights are prone to cracking due to heat and road debris.
    * Solution: Replacement of the fog lights.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sticky Buttons/Trim**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some interior plastic components, particularly buttons and trim pieces, can develop a sticky or tacky surface over time. This is a common issue with certain European cars of this era due to the type of plastic used and its reaction to heat and humidity.
    * Solution: Refurbishing the affected components or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the number of components and the chosen repair method)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Maserati GranSport, while offering a rewarding driving experience, can be a costly car to maintain. The most significant issues relate to the engine (variator failures, oil leaks) and the Cambiocorsa transmission (clutch wear, F1 pump failures), which can result in expensive repairs. Electrical gremlins and suspension issues can also contribute to overall ownership costs. Potential buyers should budget for regular maintenance and be prepared for the possibility of unexpected repairs. Because of the high cost of maintenance, purchasing a GranSport with known service history and a recent pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Maserati technician is highly recommended.
