The 2019 Karma Revero is a luxury plug-in hybrid vehicle that attempts to blend performance with eco-consciousness. It features a twin-turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine sourced from GM, which acts as a generator for the electric motors that drive the wheels. This powertrain configuration is the only one available for the 2019 model year. The electric motors produce a combined 403 horsepower and 981 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the car's distinctive styling and luxurious interior. However, common complaints include the car's high price, reliance on electric charging, and complex powertrain, which can lead to reliability concerns.
