The 2022 Karma Revero is a luxury electric vehicle with a range-extended gasoline engine, effectively functioning as a plug-in hybrid. The Revero features a twin electric motor setup delivering a combined output of 536 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque. The gasoline engine is a 1.5L turbocharged three-cylinder which is used as a generator to recharge the battery and extend the driving range. While praised for its striking design, luxurious interior, and strong acceleration, the Revero has faced criticism for its high price tag, complex hybrid system which could result in higher maintenance costs, and reliability issues reported by some owners. There is no traditional transmission; the electric motors directly drive the wheels, so there are no gear changes.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Electric Motor Setup**

*   **Motor Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power output, warning lights on the dashboard, and potential complete shutdown of the vehicle's drivetrain. May occur during prolonged periods of high-performance driving or in extremely hot ambient temperatures.
    *   Solution: Allow the motor to cool down. Inspect and potentially replace the motor coolant pump or radiator if they are faulty. Software updates may also improve thermal management.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the part that needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced range, slower charging times, and inaccurate state-of-charge readings. Battery degradation is a normal part of EV ownership, but premature degradation can be a concern.
    *   Solution: Battery health depends on the number of times you have charged it, as well as the way you are charging it. Replace the battery pack. Consider thermal management upgrades.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000 - $20,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Range Extender (1.5L Turbocharged Three-Cylinder)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and potential stalling. Faulty fuel injectors can disrupt the proper air-fuel mixture.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injectors. Check for any underlying issues causing the injector failure, such as contaminated fuel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the engine, reduced power, and potential oil leaks. Turbocharger failure can significantly impact the engine's performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Ensure proper lubrication to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Charging System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to charge the vehicle, slow charging speeds, error messages on the dashboard, or issues with the charging port.
    *   Solution: Inspect the charging port, charging cable, and onboard charger for any damage or defects. Reset the charging system. Replace the faulty components if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride height, sagging of the vehicle on one side, and a noisy air compressor. Air suspension systems are prone to leaks in the air struts or lines.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air struts or lines. Inspect and potentially replace the air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes frequently. Software glitches can cause instability in the system.
    *   Solution: Perform a system reset. Update the software to the latest version. If the problem persists, replace the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ depending on if the software can be updated, or if the screen needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate readings or complete failure of the sensors. Warning lights may appear on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the faulty sensors. Check the wiring and connections for any damage or corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor.

**Summary:**

The 2022 Karma Revero, while offering a luxurious and high-performance driving experience, can suffer from a range of issues, particularly relating to its complex electric drivetrain, range extender engine, and advanced electronic systems. The most common and potentially costly problems involve battery degradation, electric motor overheating, and malfunctions within the charging system. Issues with the 1.5L turbo engine can also result in costly repairs. The air suspension is also a point of concern as well. While not every owner will experience these issues, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for higher maintenance costs and the importance of thorough inspections and maintenance.
