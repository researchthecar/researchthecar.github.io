The 2020 Karma Revero GT is a luxury electric vehicle with a gasoline-powered range extender. The Revero GT boasts a combined system output of 536 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque from its twin electric motors. It uses a 28 kWh battery pack and a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine supplied by BMW as a generator, not directly driving the wheels. Owners appreciate the car's distinctive styling, luxurious interior, and unique driving experience. Some criticisms include its high price, limited dealer network, and the complexity of its powertrain.

Motor bearing and battery failures can be expensive to resolve, while electrical glitches and interior trim problems are more common nuisances. The coolant and oil leaks on the range extender are less severe but can still lead to significant repair costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major component failures, with associated costs spanning from a few hundred to several thousands of dollars. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision and long-term ownership costs.
