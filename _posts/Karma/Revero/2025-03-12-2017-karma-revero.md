The 2017 Karma Revero is a luxury plug-in hybrid vehicle known for its distinctive styling and focus on sustainability. It utilizes a twin-motor drive system paired with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine sourced from General Motors, which acts as a generator to extend the vehicle's range. The engine does not directly power the wheels. Peak output from the electric motors is rated at 403 horsepower and 981 lb-ft of torque. The Revero's appeal lies in its unique design, luxurious interior appointments, and electric driving capabilities. However, some owners have reported concerns regarding reliability, particularly with the car's complex electrical systems and range extender engine. The Revero originally had a price point of around $130,000, so maintenance and repair costs also tend to be high.

**Electric Motor**

**Twin Electric Motor Drive System**
*   **Loss of Power/Reduced Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported experiencing a sudden loss of power or a noticeable reduction in the vehicle's electric range. This can manifest as sluggish acceleration or an inability to achieve the advertised range.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the battery pack's health, the electric motor's performance, and the associated control modules for any faults. A software update may be required to address some issues. In severe cases, battery pack or motor replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $15,000+ depending on if the motor or battery pack is the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the car failing to charge, slow charging, or inability to use certain charging stations.
    *   Solution: Inspect the charging port, onboard charger, and charging cables for damage. Resetting the charging system or performing a software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, the onboard charger may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,500+ depending on the source of the problem.
