The 2018 Karma Revero is a luxury plug-in hybrid vehicle. It features a twin-motor rear-wheel-drive system powered by a 21.4 kWh battery pack and a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine acting as a generator (range extender). The engine produces 235 horsepower and is only used to charge the battery, not to directly drive the wheels. Owners generally appreciate the Revero's unique styling, luxurious interior, and electric driving range. Criticisms often revolve around its reliability, complex electrical system, and limited dealer network, impacting repair accessibility.
