Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2023 Karma GS-6, categorized by major components, following your specified format.

The 2023 Karma GS-6 is a plug-in hybrid luxury sedan. It's known for its distinctive styling, luxurious interior, and electric driving range. The GS-6 features a 28 kWh battery paired with a BMW-sourced 1.5L turbocharged three-cylinder engine acting as a range extender (not directly powering the wheels). The GS-6 delivers a combined 536 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque. People generally appreciate the car's unique design and the experience of driving an EV with the reassurance of a range extender. Dislikes often center on the higher price point compared to other EVs and plug-in hybrids, and concerns about the long-term reliability and parts availability given Karma's history.

**Electric Motor**

*   **Electric Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete failure of one or both electric motors, resulting in a loss of propulsion. This can manifest as a sudden stop or an inability to accelerate. Warning lights related to the electric powertrain will likely illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty electric motor(s). Diagnosis should include checking wiring harnesses and control modules to rule out other potential causes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+ (depending on whether one or both motors need replacing and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Reduced Electric Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Significantly reduced electric driving range compared to the advertised range (around 61 miles). This can be caused by degradation of the battery pack or issues with the battery management system (BMS).
    *   Solution: Diagnose the battery health using specialized equipment. If degradation is significant, battery pack replacement might be necessary. If the BMS is faulty, it may require reprogramming or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement: $15,000 - $25,000+; BMS Repair/Replacement: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Range Extender (1.5L Turbocharged 3-Cylinder)**

*   **Engine Stalling/Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 1.5L range extender engine stalls or misfires intermittently, especially under load or during transitions between electric and engine power. This can be due to issues with the fuel injection system, ignition system, or vacuum leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the stalling/misfires. This may involve checking spark plugs, fuel injectors, ignition coils, and vacuum lines. Repair or replace any faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the specific component needing repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from various locations in the engine bay, such as hoses, the water pump, or the cylinder head. This can lead to overheating and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Locate the source of the coolant leak and repair or replace the affected component (hose, water pump, gasket, etc.). Pressure test the cooling system to ensure all leaks are resolved.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical System**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. If the problem persists, a software update or replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: $0 - $200; Infotainment Unit Replacement: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery drains prematurely, resulting in starting problems or electrical system malfunctions. This can be caused by parasitic draw from various electrical components or a faulty battery.
    *   Solution: Test the 12V battery and charging system. Identify and repair any sources of parasitic draw. Replace the battery if it is faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery Replacement: $100 - $300; Parasitic Draw Diagnosis and Repair: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Port Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The charging port has connection or alignment issues that prevent it from charging. This can be the physical connector on the car or the charging port itself.
    * Solution: Diagnose and replace damaged charging port components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof fails to open, close, or seal properly. This can be due to a faulty motor, damaged tracks, or a misaligned sunroof panel.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the sunroof mechanism and repair or replace any faulty components. This may involve lubricating the tracks, realigning the panel, or replacing the motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sensors on the exterior of the vehicle malfunction. This includes parking sensors, blind-spot detection sensors, or sensors related to autonomous driving features.
    *   Solution: Diagnose each sensor to determine the cause of failure. Check the wiring and connection to each sensor. Replace sensors that have failed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ Per Sensor

**Summary**

The 2023 Karma GS-6, while offering a unique and luxurious driving experience, appears to have some potential issues. The most concerning are those related to the electric motors and battery system, as these can be very expensive to repair. The range extender engine also has some potential problems, as well as electrical and interior component issues. It is worth noting that because the GS-6 is not a high volume seller, data on reliability and common problems is limited. Prospective buyers should thoroughly research these issues and consider an extended warranty or independent inspection before purchasing.
