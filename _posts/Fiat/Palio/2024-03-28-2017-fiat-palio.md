**Introduction to the 2017 Fiat Palio**

The 2017 Fiat Palio is a subcompact hatchback that is available with two engine options: a 1.0-liter MultiJet diesel engine and a 1.2-liter FireFlex gasoline engine. Both engines are paired with a five-speed manual transmission. The Palio is praised for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency, and affordability, but it has also been criticized for its lack of features, poor ride quality, and limited power from the 1.0-liter engine.

**Summary**

The 2017 Fiat Palio is a budget-friendly hatchback with some notable issues in its engine and transmission. While the 1.2-liter gasoline engine is generally reliable, the 1.0-liter diesel engine has been prone to costly oil pump and turbocharger failures. The 5-speed manual transmission has also experienced issues with gear grinding and clutch failure. Electrical and exterior problems are relatively minor and cost-effective to fix. Interior issues include power window failure and dashboard rattle, but they are not as common or severe as the engine and transmission issues.
