I cannot provide information on a "2019 Fiat Palio" as this model was not sold in many markets, including North America. The Fiat Palio is primarily a South American and developing market vehicle, and detailed, publicly available data on common issues, repair costs, and recalls for specific model years like 2019 is very limited and often localized. The reliability data needed to accurately compile the information you requested is not readily available and would likely vary significantly based on the region where the vehicle was sold and maintained. This information is not available to me, and you may not find the data for this specific model, year, and configuration in the format required.

While I cannot create the response in the exact format you requested, here is a general overview of common issues found in Fiat vehicles within that era. Note that these are *general* potential issues, and not specifically for the 2019 Palio model and may not be accurate.
