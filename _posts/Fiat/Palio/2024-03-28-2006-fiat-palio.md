**Introduction to the 2006 Fiat Palio**

The 2006 Fiat Palio is a subcompact hatchback offered with a range of engine and transmission options. It provides a combination of affordability, practicality, and a peppy driving experience. However, like any vehicle, it has certain issues that potential buyers should be aware of.

The Palio came with several engine choices:
