The 2015 Fiat Palio is a subcompact car popular in South America, particularly Brazil. It was available with several engine options, including the 1.0L Fire Evo, 1.4L Fire Evo, and 1.6L E.torQ engines, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a Dualogic automated manual transmission (depending on the engine). The 1.0L Fire Evo engine produces around 73-75 horsepower and 69 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the Palio for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and relatively spacious interior for its class. However, common complaints include build quality issues, a somewhat dated design, and lackluster performance, particularly with the smaller engines.
