The 2009 Fiat Strada is a compact utility pickup truck, primarily sold in South America and other select markets. In 2009, the Strada was available with a 1.4L 8V inline-4 petrol engine producing around 85 horsepower and 90 lb-ft of torque. It was also available with a 1.3L Multijet diesel engine, producing around 85 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the Strada's utility, fuel efficiency, and compact size, making it suitable for urban environments and light-duty work. Common complaints include its relatively basic interior, limited passenger space, and sometimes questionable reliability.
