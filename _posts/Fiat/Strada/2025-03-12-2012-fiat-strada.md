**Engine**

**1.4L Fire Petrol/Gasoline**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the cause is crucial. It could be worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or issues with the PCV system. Repair can range from replacing valve stem seals to a complete engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the cause and extent of the repair).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points, including the water pump, radiator hoses, and the thermostat housing. Overheating may occur if coolant levels drop significantly.
    * Solution: Identify and replace the leaking component. Pressure testing the cooling system can help pinpoint the source.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the component leaking).
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.3L Multijet Diesel**
* **EGR Valve Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Diesel engines are prone to EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve issues. Symptoms include rough idling, poor acceleration, and black smoke from the exhaust. The engine may also enter limp mode.
    * Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. In some cases, the EGR cooler may also need to be inspected and cleaned.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, whistling noises from the turbocharger, and excessive smoke can indicate turbocharger problems.
    * Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for damage or wear. Repair or replace the turbocharger as needed. Check for any oil leaks at the compressor and turbine housings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the extent of damage and whether a rebuild or replacement is necessary).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Difficulty Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, especially 1st or reverse. Grinding noises during gear changes.
    * Solution: Check the clutch cable for proper adjustment (if applicable). Inspect the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing for wear or damage. Low transmission fluid level can also cause this.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the issue, clutch replacement can be expensive).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Synchros**
    * Description/Symptoms: Grinding noise when shifting gears, especially when downshifting. Difficulty shifting into specific gears.
    * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement is usually required to replace worn synchros.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and vague steering.
    * Solution: Inspect and replace worn bushings in the control arms, sway bar links, and struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the number of bushings replaced).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced load carrying capacity, rear of the vehicle sitting lower than normal.
    * Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination. The specific symptoms will depend on the sensor that has failed (e.g., O2 sensor, MAF sensor, crankshaft position sensor).
    * Solution: Diagnose the failed sensor using a scan tool and replace it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the sensor).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Central Locking Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Central locking system malfunctioning, doors not locking or unlocking properly with the remote or key.
