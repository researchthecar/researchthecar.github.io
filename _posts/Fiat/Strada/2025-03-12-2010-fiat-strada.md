The 2010 Fiat Strada is a compact pickup truck known for its practicality and affordability, primarily sold in South American markets. In 2010, the Strada was offered with a few engine options, including the 1.4L Fire four-cylinder engine, the 1.8L Ecotec gasoline engine, and the 1.3L Multijet diesel engine. A 5-speed manual transmission was the most common offering for this vehicle. The 1.4L Fire engine produces around 85 horsepower and 90 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the Strada's maneuverability and fuel efficiency. Common complaints often cite the relatively basic interior and ride quality and lack of safety features compared to newer vehicles.
