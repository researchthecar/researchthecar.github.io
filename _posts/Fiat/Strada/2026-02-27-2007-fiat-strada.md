### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Fiat Strada is a functional workhorse with a generally acceptable reliability record for its class and age. The most common technical concerns revolve around the diesel engine's DPF system, particularly on higher mileage examples, and potential issues with glow plugs and turbochargers. Manual transmissions can experience clutch wear, a common wear item. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also susceptible to wear. Electrical gremlins, often due to corrosion, can manifest as intermittent faults. Exterior rust is a concern, especially in harsher climates. While not immune to problems, most issues are repairable and not indicative of systemic design flaws. Regular maintenance and addressing early warning signs are key to maintaining reliability.
