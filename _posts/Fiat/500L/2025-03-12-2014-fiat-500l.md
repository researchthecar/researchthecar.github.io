The 2014 Fiat 500L is a small wagon known for its spacious interior and distinctive Italian styling. It was offered with a single engine option: a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder MultiAir engine producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. The vehicle had two transmission options: a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed dual dry clutch transmission (DDCT). Owners often appreciate the 500L's quirky design, ample headroom, and cargo capacity for its class. However, common complaints include reliability issues, particularly with the DDCT transmission, electrical glitches, and subpar build quality.
