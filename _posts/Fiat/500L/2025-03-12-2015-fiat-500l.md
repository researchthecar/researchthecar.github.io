The 2015 Fiat 500L is a compact multi-purpose vehicle known for its distinctive Italian styling and spacious interior compared to the standard Fiat 500. All 2015 Fiat 500L models are powered by a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed dual dry clutch automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the 500L's quirky design, high seating position, and generous cargo space, while others dislike its reliability issues, unrefined driving dynamics, and unconventional styling.
