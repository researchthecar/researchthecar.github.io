The 2017 Fiat 500L is a compact wagon known for its spacious interior and quirky Italian styling. It is powered by a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, which produces 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. It comes paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the 500L's roomy cabin, good visibility, and unique design.
