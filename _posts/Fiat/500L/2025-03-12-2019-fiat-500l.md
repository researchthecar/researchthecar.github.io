The 2019 Fiat 500L is a quirky, small wagon that offers more passenger and cargo space than the regular Fiat 500. It's powered by a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with a six-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the 500L's distinctive styling, spacious interior, and relatively affordable price. However, some common complaints include its lackluster driving dynamics, reliability concerns, and somewhat dated infotainment system.
