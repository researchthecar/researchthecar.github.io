**Introduction:**

The 2019 Fiat 500L is a compact crossover with a spacious interior and a comfortable ride. It is available with a choice of two engines (1.4-liter MultiAir Turbo and 1.3-liter MultiJet II Turbo Diesel) and two transmissions (a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic). The 1.4-liter engine produces 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.3-liter diesel engine produces 95 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque.

Owners praise the Fiat 500L for its stylish design, agile handling, and comfortable interior. However, it has received criticism for its poor fuel economy, slow acceleration, and cramped third row of seats.
