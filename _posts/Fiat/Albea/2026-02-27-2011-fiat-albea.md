### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Fiat Albea, while a budget-friendly option, presents a mixed reliability profile. The petrol engines are generally robust, but the diesel variants, particularly the 1.9L JTDm, can be prone to DPF and turbocharger issues, which can be costly to repair. Transmission-wise, manual gearboxes can experience clutch wear and synchro problems, while the automated manual can suffer from actuator failures. Suspension components like bushings and shock absorbers are common wear items. Electrical issues such as alternator and window regulator failures are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate and maintenance. Overall, while not inherently unreliable, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and factor in potential repair costs, especially for diesel models and automated transmissions.
