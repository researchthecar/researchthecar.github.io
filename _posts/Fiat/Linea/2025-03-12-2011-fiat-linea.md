The 2011 Fiat Linea is a compact sedan known for its stylish Italian design and comfortable ride. Engine options for the 2011 model year included the 1.4L T-Jet petrol engine, producing approximately 114 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, and the 1.3L Multijet diesel engine with around 90 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were typically a 5-speed manual for both engines and, in some markets, a 5-speed automated manual (Dualogic) for the diesel.
