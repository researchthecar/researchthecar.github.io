Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2012 Fiat Panda, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2012 Fiat Panda is a city car known for its compact size, practicality, and fuel efficiency. It came with a few engine options, including the 1.2L FIRE petrol engine (69 hp, 75 lb-ft torque), the 0.9L TwinAir petrol engine (65-85 hp, 73-107 lb-ft torque), and the 1.3L Multijet diesel engine (75 hp, 140 lb-ft torque). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a Dualogic automated manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate its maneuverability in urban environments and its affordability. Common dislikes include limited space, especially in the rear, and concerns about reliability.

**Engine**

**1.2L FIRE Petrol Engine**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often noticed as a burning smell or oil spots under the car. The leak can originate from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or crankshaft seal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal. Cleaning the engine block and surrounding area after the repair is completed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine idles roughly, and the car vibrates noticeably while stopped. This is often caused by dirty or faulty throttle body or ignition coil.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body or replacing faulty ignition coils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**0.9L TwinAir Petrol Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent need to add engine oil between service intervals. Engine oil levels will need to be checked more often than with a 1.2L FIRE.
    *   Solution: Addressing potential causes like worn piston rings or valve stem seals, including repairs and proper oil monitoring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the cause and repair complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise coming from the engine, especially on startup. This often indicates wear or stretching of the timing chain. If ignored, it can lead to serious engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain and associated components (tensioners, guides).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.3L Multijet Diesel Engine**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF warning light illuminated, reduced engine performance, and increased fuel consumption. Common causes include short trips that don't allow the DPF to regenerate properly.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration, cleaning of the DPF, or replacement of the DPF. Driving longer distances at higher speeds can sometimes resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, rough idling, black smoke from the exhaust, and the engine warning light illuminating. EGR valve issues are more common in diesel engines.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Hard Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, especially between 1st and 2nd or 2nd and 3rd. This can be due to worn synchros, damaged shift linkage, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn synchros, adjusting or replacing the shift linkage, or changing the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Dualogic Automated Manual Transmission**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission shifts erratically, with noticeable jerking or hesitation between gears. This can be caused by problems with the hydraulic control unit, clutch actuator, or software issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause (hydraulic control unit issues, clutch actuator problems, or software errors) and replacing or repairing the faulty component. Software updates may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or knocking noises from the suspension when driving over bumps. Common culprits are worn ball joints, tie rod ends, or sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per corner
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride height, sagging, or a noticeable break in the coil spring.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken coil springs in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system fails to lock or unlock all doors simultaneously, or the system malfunctions entirely. This is often attributed to faulty door lock actuators, wiring issues, or a malfunctioning central locking control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the malfunction and then replacing the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows fail to operate, move slowly, or get stuck. Common causes include a faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust develops on the lower sections of the doors, wheel arches, and sills, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the affected panels and applying rust prevention measures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks may appear on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: There is no official repair of this issue, so you will need to purchase an aftermarket dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Fiat Panda, while praised for its city-friendly size and fuel efficiency, does have some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the TwinAir engine (oil consumption, timing chain), and transmission issues with the Dualogic automated manual transmission can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension and electrical issues are also relatively common. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite costly to address. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor them into their purchase decision. The severity of the problems ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs.
