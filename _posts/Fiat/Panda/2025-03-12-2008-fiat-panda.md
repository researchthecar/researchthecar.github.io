The 2008 Fiat Panda is a popular city car known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability. It's a small, lightweight vehicle perfect for navigating tight urban spaces. Common engine choices include the 1.1L and 1.2L petrol engines, as well as a 1.3L Multijet diesel. The 1.2L petrol engine produces around 69 horsepower and 75 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the Panda's ease of parking, affordable running costs, and surprisingly spacious interior for its size. However, some common criticisms include its somewhat basic interior, limited performance, and occasional reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**1.2L Petrol (69hp)**
* **Coil Pack Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, engine stalling, check engine light illumination. Often caused by degradation of the coil pack due to heat and age.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty coil pack.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oxygen (O2) Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Poor fuel economy, rough idling, check engine light, potentially failed emissions test. Can be caused by contamination of the sensor or general degradation.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty O2 sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.3L Multijet Diesel**
* **EGR Valve Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, loss of power, excessive black smoke, check engine light. Diesel engines can be prone to carbon build up in the EGR valve which can cause it to stick.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, warning light on the dashboard, difficulty starting, forced regeneration failing. Short journeys can prevent the DPF from properly regenerating, leading to blockages.
    * Solution: Forced regeneration by a mechanic, cleaning the DPF, or, in severe cases, replacing the DPF.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Manual Transmission (All Engines)**

* **Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    * Description/Symptoms: Grinding noises during gear changes, difficulty engaging gears, particularly first and reverse. Often due to worn synchromesh rings or clutch issues.
    * Solution: Clutch replacement, transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps, imprecise handling, uneven tire wear. The rubber bushings degrade over time, leading to excessive play in the suspension components.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400 per corner
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Broken Coil Springs**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging of the vehicle, uneven ride height, clunking noises, particularly from the rear suspension.
    * Solution: Replacement of the broken coil spring, often recommended to replace in pairs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500 per corner
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Faulty Window Regulators**
    * Description/Symptoms: Windows not operating correctly, slow or erratic window movement, grinding noises. The plastic components within the window regulator can break or wear down over time.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Central Locking Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Central locking system not working properly, doors not locking or unlocking, remote key fob malfunctioning.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the central locking module or individual door lock actuators.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust around Wheel Arches and Sills**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible rust bubbles or surface rust developing around the wheel arches and along the sills of the car. Common in areas with harsh winters or heavy road salt use.
    * Solution: Rust repair, including cutting out the affected metal, welding in new sections, and repainting.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300+ per area
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates due to prolonged sun exposure and the material drying out.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or dashboard repair and refinishing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Fiat Panda, while generally a reliable city car, can suffer from a range of issues typical for vehicles of its age and class. Engine problems such as coil pack and O2 sensor failures, along with EGR valve and DPF issues for the diesel variant, are common. Suspension components like bushings and coil springs are prone to wear and tear. Electrical issues, particularly with window regulators and central locking, can also occur. Exterior rust can be a concern, especially in areas with harsh weather conditions. Interior issues include dashboard cracking. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as rust repair or transmission work, can be more costly. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the Panda's reliability and extend its lifespan.
