### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Fiat Panda is a practical city car with a generally acceptable reliability record for its segment. Petrol engines (1.1L and 1.2L) are typically robust. The 1.3L Multijet diesel, while economical, can be prone to DPF issues and turbocharger problems, especially if not driven appropriately for diesel particulate filter regeneration. The manual transmission is usually trouble-free, but the Dualogic automated manual can experience actuator failures. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and central locking, are not uncommon. Overall, the Panda offers good value, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific diesel engine concerns and be prepared for minor electrical repairs. Regular servicing is key to mitigating these potential issues.
