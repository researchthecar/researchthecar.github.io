### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Fiat Panda is a generally reliable city car, with its petrol engines (1.1L and 1.2L FIRE) being particularly robust. The 1.3L Multijet diesel, while economical, can be prone to DPF and turbocharger issues, which are common in many modern diesels. The automated Dualogic transmission is a known weak point, with potential actuator failures. Suspension components like bushings can wear, leading to noise. Electrical issues, such as window regulators and alternators, are also reported. Overall, for its segment, the Panda offers reasonable reliability, especially with diligent maintenance, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific concerns related to the diesel engine and automated gearbox.
