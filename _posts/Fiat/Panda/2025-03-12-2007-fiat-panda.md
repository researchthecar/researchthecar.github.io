The 2007 Fiat Panda is a small, city-friendly car known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability. Engine options for the 2007 Panda included the 1.1L Petrol (54 hp, 66 lb-ft torque) and the 1.2L Petrol (60 hp, 74 lb-ft torque) engines, alongside a 1.3L Multijet Diesel (69 hp, 107 lb-ft torque). All engines were typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, although some models had a Dualogic automated manual. Owners generally appreciate the Panda's compact size for navigating tight urban spaces and its low running costs. Common dislikes include its basic interior, limited performance, and potential reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2007 Fiat Panda, while practical and efficient, does have some common issues. Engine problems like coil pack and lambda sensor failures (1.2L Petrol), EGR valve and DPF issues (1.3L Diesel) can be costly. Transmission problems, especially with the Dualogic system, are also a significant concern. Suspension and electrical faults further contribute to the overall ownership experience. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like DPF replacement or Dualogic actuator repairs, can be a significant financial burden. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
