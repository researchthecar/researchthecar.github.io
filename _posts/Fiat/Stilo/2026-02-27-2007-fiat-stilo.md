### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Fiat Stilo exhibits common European car reliability traits for its era, with particular attention needed for its electrical systems and diesel engine components like the DPF. Petrol engines, especially the smaller displacement ones, can experience ignition and VVT issues. The Dualogic automatic transmission is a known weak point. Suspension components and interior trim can also develop wear and tear, leading to noises. While not the most reliable vehicle on the market, proactive maintenance and addressing specific known issues can mitigate many potential problems, making it a potentially affordable choice for those aware of its quirks.
