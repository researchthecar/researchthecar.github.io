The 2007 Fiat Stilo is a compact car that was available in a variety of configurations. The most common engine options include the 1.4L 16V (95 hp, 127 Nm torque), the 1.6L 16V (105 hp, 145 Nm torque), the 1.8L 16V (133 hp, 162 Nm torque), and the 1.9L Multijet diesel engine (various outputs, commonly 120 hp). Available transmissions include 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual (diesel models), and some automated manual options. People generally liked the Stilo for its distinctive styling (especially the 3-door version), spacious interior, and relatively comfortable ride. Dislikes often centered around perceived reliability issues, build quality concerns, and somewhat underwhelming driving dynamics compared to rivals.

**Summary**

The 2007 Fiat Stilo can be a reasonably priced vehicle, but prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for reliability issues. The most common problems revolve around engine components (ignition coils, sensors, EGR valve), suspension bushings, and electrical gremlins (BCM, dashboard display). Repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes (e.g., replacing a coil pack) to more costly issues like turbocharger replacement or BCM repairs. Overall, while not crippling, the sheer number of potential issues and their combined cost could make ownership more expensive than some comparable vehicles. It is recommended that any prospective purchase have a thorough inspection before buying.
