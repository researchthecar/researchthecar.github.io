**Introduction to the 2017 Fiat 500X**
The 2017 Fiat 500X is a compact crossover SUV that combines stylish design with practical features. It was offered with a choice of two engines: a 1.4L turbocharged MultiAir 4-cylinder engine and a 2.4L Tigershark MultiAir 4-cylinder engine, both paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. The 1.4L engine produces 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.4L engine generates 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. The 500X received praise for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and agile handling.
