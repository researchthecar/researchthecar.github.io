The 2017 Fiat 500X is a subcompact crossover known for its Italian styling and available all-wheel drive. The base engine is a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder MultiAir engine producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. This engine is only available with a six-speed manual transmission. A more powerful and popular option is the 2.4-liter Tigershark four-cylinder engine that produces 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, which is exclusively paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the 500X's unique design and nimble handling, but some criticize its reliability and fuel economy, particularly with the 2.4-liter engine and nine-speed transmission.

**Engine**

**1.4L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (MultiAir)**
No Issues Found

**2.4L Four-Cylinder (Tigershark)**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the 2.4L Tigershark engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be observed through low oil level warnings or by manually checking the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Initially, check for any external leaks around the valve cover gasket, oil pan, or rear main seal. If no external leaks are found, it may be internal consumption due to worn piston rings or valve stem seals. In severe cases, engine replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (for checking leaks), $100-$200 (valve cover gasket replacement), $500-$1500+ (piston ring or valve stem seal replacement), $4000 - $7000+ (engine replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Manual (paired with 1.4L)**
No Issues Found

**Nine-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting and Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, especially during low-speed acceleration and deceleration. The transmission may also hesitate or feel like it's searching for the correct gear. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Some owners have found that transmission software updates can improve shift quality. If the issue persists, a transmission fluid flush or valve body replacement might be necessary. In severe cases, transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (software update), $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $800 - $1500 (valve body replacement), $3000 - $6000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported complete transmission failure, resulting in the vehicle being unable to move. This can be preceded by slipping, loud noises, or a complete loss of power.
    *   Solution: Transmission replacement is often the only solution in cases of complete failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**
No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system can experience freezing, crashing, or lagging. Bluetooth connectivity issues are also common. The screen may become unresponsive or display error messages.
    *   Solution: Try performing a hard reset of the Uconnect system. Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. If the problems persist, the Uconnect module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (hard reset), $100 - $200 (software update), $500 - $1500+ (Uconnect module replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, resulting in the vehicle failing to start. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw. Common culprits include faulty door locks, aftermarket electronics, or a malfunctioning body control module (BCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (diagnostics), $50 - $500+ (depending on the faulty component).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tail Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with the tail lights, specifically with the bulbs burning out prematurely or the entire assembly failing.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty bulb or the entire tail light assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $50 (bulb replacement), $100 - $300 (tail light assembly replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to function properly, either not heating at all or overheating.
    *   Solution: Check the wiring and connections to the seat heater element. If the wiring is intact, the seat heater element may need to be replaced.

**Summary**

The 2017 Fiat 500X can present several issues, especially concerning the 2.4L engine and nine-speed automatic transmission. The most significant concerns are excessive oil consumption and transmission problems, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues, like Uconnect problems and battery drain, are also relatively common. While the 1.4L engine and manual transmission seem more reliable, the availability of the 2.4L engine makes it a much more common configuration in the 500X. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection to assess the vehicle's condition. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying significantly depending on the problem.
