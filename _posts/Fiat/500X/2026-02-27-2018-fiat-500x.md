### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Fiat 500X presents a mixed reliability profile. Owners have reported notable issues with both the 1.4L and 2.4L engines, particularly concerning turbocharger problems, oil leaks, and oil consumption in the larger engine. The 9-speed automatic transmission can also be a source of concern, with common complaints about shifting quality and potential overheating.
