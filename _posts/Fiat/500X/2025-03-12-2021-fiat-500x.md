**Summary**

The 2021 Fiat 500X presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. Engine issues, particularly excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failures, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, such as rough shifting, can impact the driving experience. Electrical issues, like infotainment system malfunctions, are also a recurring concern. While some problems might be resolved with relatively inexpensive fixes, major repairs like engine or transmission replacements can be quite expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing.
