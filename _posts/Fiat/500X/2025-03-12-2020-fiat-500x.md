*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 2020 Fiat 500X with the 1.3L turbo engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can be indicated by the low oil level warning light illuminating, or noticing a burning oil smell.

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping refers to the engine revving without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This can occur during acceleration or when shifting gears.
    *   Solution: Slipping often indicates internal damage within the transmission. Repair options range from valve body replacement to complete transmission overhaul or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve Body Replacement: $800 - $1,500, Transmission Overhaul: $2,000-$4,000, Transmission Replacement: $3,000 - $6,000+
