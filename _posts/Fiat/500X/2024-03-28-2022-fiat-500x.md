**Introduction:**

The 2022 Fiat 500X is a subcompact crossover SUV offered with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The base engine is a 1.3L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 150 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine is a 2.4L naturally aspirated four-cylinder generating 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. The 1.3L engine is paired with a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, while the 2.4L engine comes exclusively with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Despite its small size, the 500X has a spacious interior, a user-friendly infotainment system, and a comfortable ride. However, it has some drawbacks, including a lack of power from the base engine, a cramped back seat, and poor fuel economy.
