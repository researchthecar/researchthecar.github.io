The 2016 Fiat 500X is a subcompact crossover SUV that offers Italian styling and available all-wheel drive. Engine options for this year include a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission, and a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the 500X for its unique styling and available features, while common dislikes include its reliability, relatively small interior, and somewhat lackluster fuel economy compared to competitors.
