The 2019 Fiat 124 Spider is a stylish and fun-to-drive roadster that shares its platform with the Mazda MX-5 Miata. It features a turbocharged 1.4-liter MultiAir inline-4 engine producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque (164 hp in Abarth trim). Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise its engaging driving dynamics, distinctive Italian styling, and open-air experience. Common criticisms include limited interior space, some turbo lag, and concerns about reliability, although largely sharing the Miata's mechanical underpinnings helps address the latter.
