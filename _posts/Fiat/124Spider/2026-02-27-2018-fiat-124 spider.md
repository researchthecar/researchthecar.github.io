### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Fiat 124 Spider is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly benefiting from its Mazda-derived mechanicals. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the 1.4L turbocharged engine, specifically potential turbocharger problems and oil leaks, which can incur moderate repair costs. The manual transmission's clutch is a wear item that may require replacement over time. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system, and occasional issues with the convertible top mechanism are also noted. However, many owners report a positive experience with fewer significant problems than might be expected for a vehicle in this segment. Regular maintenance and addressing early signs of potential issues are key to ensuring long-term reliability.
