### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Fiat 124 Spider is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly benefiting from its shared platform with Mazda. The most commonly reported technical issues tend to revolve around the turbocharged engine, specifically related to the turbocharger itself and potential oil leaks. Transmission issues, while not pervasive, can occur with both manual (clutch wear) and automatic (shifting hesitation) variants. Electrical gremlins, primarily affecting the infotainment system's connectivity and responsiveness, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread significant problems. Regular maintenance and addressing early signs of the aforementioned issues can contribute to a positive ownership experience.
