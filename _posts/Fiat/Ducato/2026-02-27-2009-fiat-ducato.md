### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Fiat Ducato demonstrates a generally acceptable reliability for its class, with most reported issues stemming from the diesel particulate filter (DPF) systems on diesel engines, particularly under urban driving conditions. Transmission issues, especially with the automated manual, can be costly. Suspension components like ball joints and shock absorbers are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module, can be intermittent but require professional diagnosis. Exterior rust is a concern for vehicles in harsher climates. Overall, while not immune to problems, proactive maintenance, especially concerning the DPF and regular checks of suspension and transmission, can ensure continued serviceability.
