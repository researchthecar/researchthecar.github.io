The 2016 Fiat Ducato is a popular choice for commercial use and camper conversions due to its spacious interior and relatively affordable price point. Engine options for the 2016 model year typically included a 2.3-liter Multijet II diesel engine available in various power outputs, such as 130 horsepower and 320 Nm of torque. There was also a 3.0-liter MultiJet diesel with higher outputs. Depending on the market, these engines were paired with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed Comfort-Matic automated manual transmission. People appreciate the Ducato's practicality and cargo capacity but often cite concerns about reliability and the cost of repairs as downsides.
