Okay, here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2011 Fiat Ducato, structured as requested. I've tried to be as specific as possible, based on available information. Due to the variations in configurations and regional differences, this is a general guide. Always verify information with reliable sources and qualified mechanics.

The 2011 Fiat Ducato is a popular van, known for its practicality, spaciousness, and versatility, widely used for commercial purposes and camper conversions. Engine options commonly available in 2011 included the 2.2L Multijet diesel (around 100-120hp, 250-320 Nm torque), the 2.3L Multijet diesel (around 120-150hp, 320-350 Nm torque), and the 3.0L Multijet diesel (around 160-180hp, 400 Nm torque). Transmission options were typically a 5-speed or 6-speed manual, or a 6-speed automated manual transmission (AMT), depending on the engine and market. People often appreciate the Ducato's large cargo capacity and ease of modification, but common dislikes include reported electrical issues, ride comfort, and potential for rust, especially in harsher climates.
