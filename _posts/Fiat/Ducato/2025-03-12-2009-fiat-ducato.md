The 2009 Fiat Ducato is a popular choice for commercial use and camper conversions, known for its spacious cargo area and relatively economical diesel engines. Available engines for the 2009 model year included a 2.2L Multijet diesel (100hp, 250Nm), a 2.3L Multijet diesel (120hp, 320Nm), and a 3.0L Multijet Power diesel (157hp, 400Nm). These were typically paired with a 5-speed or 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the Ducato's practicality and load capacity, but common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the electrics and some aspects of the engine. This can make it a less worry-free option compared to some of its competitors.
