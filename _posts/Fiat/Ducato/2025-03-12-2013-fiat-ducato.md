The 2013 Fiat Ducato is a popular choice for commercial use, camper conversions, and recreational vehicles due to its spacious interior and relatively fuel-efficient diesel engines. The Ducato offers practicality and versatility, making it a favorite for businesses and individuals alike. However, owners have reported some common issues. People often like the Ducato's large cargo capacity, ease of driving, and the availability of different body lengths and heights. Dislikes often revolve around reliability concerns, build quality, and the availability of parts and service in certain regions. The 2013 Ducato in Europe primarily came with a range of diesel engine options. The most common is a 2.3-liter Multijet diesel, which produced between 130 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque depending on the exact variant, but was available in a range of horsepower ratings. Other options included a 2.0-liter Multijet diesel and a 3.0-liter Multijet diesel. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed or 6-speed manual, depending on the engine. Some models may have been offered with an automatic transmission, though less common.
