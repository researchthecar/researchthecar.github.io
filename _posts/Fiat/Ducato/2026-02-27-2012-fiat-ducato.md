### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Fiat Ducato generally performs well as a commercial vehicle, with its diesel engines being a common point of attention for potential issues like DPF and EGR valve problems, particularly with the 1.9L variant. The 2.3L engine can experience turbocharger-related concerns. Transmission-wise, manual clutches can wear, and the automatic Dualogic system may encounter actuator or hydraulic issues. Suspension components like bushings and shock absorbers are typical wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor are also noted. Overall, while not immune to problems, many issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
