### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Fiat Ducato demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its chassis and core mechanical components. The primary areas that may require attention are related to the diesel emissions control systems (DPF and AdBlue) on the MultiJet engines, which can be sensitive to driving conditions and require specific maintenance. Transmission issues are infrequent, with manual clutches being a wear item and automatics occasionally needing software updates. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches or battery drain, are not uncommon but are generally manageable. With proactive maintenance and awareness of potential diesel emission system needs, the Ducato should serve as a dependable workhorse.
