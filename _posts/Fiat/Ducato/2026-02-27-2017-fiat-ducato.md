### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Fiat Ducato is a capable commercial vehicle with a generally good reliability record, particularly concerning its core mechanical components. The most frequently reported issues revolve around the diesel engines' emissions systems, specifically DPF clogging and EGR valve problems, which are common in many modern diesels. Transmission issues, while not pervasive, can occur, especially with the automated manual 'Comfort-Matic' system. Owners should be mindful of potential electrical gremlins like battery drain and sensor failures. Exterior and interior components are largely robust, though sliding door mechanisms and occasional condensation in lights are noted. Proactive maintenance and addressing warning lights promptly are key to ensuring long-term reliability.
