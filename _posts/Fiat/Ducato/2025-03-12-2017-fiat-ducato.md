The 2017 Fiat Ducato is a popular choice for commercial use and campervan conversions due to its spacious interior and versatile platform. Engine options for the 2017 Ducato include a 2.0L Multijet II diesel engine (around 115 hp and 280 Nm of torque), a 2.3L Multijet II diesel engine (ranging from 130 hp/320 Nm to 150 hp/350 Nm, and up to 180 hp/400 Nm in some configurations), and a 3.0L Multijet Power diesel engine (180 hp and 400 Nm of torque). Transmission options typically include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed Comfort-Matic automated manual transmission. Owners appreciate the Ducato's fuel efficiency, interior space, and payload capacity. Common complaints include issues with the automated manual transmission, electrical faults, and the cost of replacement parts.

**Engine**

**2.3L Multijet II Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, black smoke from the exhaust, engine warning light illumination. Often caused by poor fuel quality.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injector(s). It is usually recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure even fuel distribution and to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ depending on the number of injectors replaced and the shop labor rates.

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, increased emissions, engine warning light. Clogging from soot and carbon deposits is a common cause.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR valve. Cleaning the EGR valve can sometimes provide a temporary fix, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbo, reduced power, excessive oil consumption, engine warning light.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the turbocharger for leaks or damage. Repair or replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ depending on the extent of the damage and if a new or remanufactured turbo is used.

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine warning light, reduced power, frequent regeneration cycles, potential for complete blockage requiring replacement.
    *   Solution: Attempt forced regeneration of the DPF. If the DPF is too clogged, replacement is necessary. Prevention through regular long-distance driving at higher speeds helps.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ for DPF replacement.

**3.0L Multijet Power Diesel**
*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. Engine misfires or poor performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, sprockets, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Comfort-Matic Automated Manual Transmission**

*   **Hesitation and Jerky Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hesitation when shifting, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Jerky or abrupt shifts. This is a common complaint with the Comfort-Matic transmission.
    *   Solution: Software update of the transmission control module (TCM) may improve shift quality. Clutch actuator problems may also need to be addressed by replacing or recalibrating the actuator. Complete transmission rebuild is sometimes necessary for severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for a software update; $800 - $2000+ for clutch actuator replacement; $3000 - $6000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.

*   **Clutch Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission not engaging, error messages on the dashboard, difficulty shifting, complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+

**Suspension**

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Doors not locking or unlocking properly, remote key not working, error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Check the central locking module, door lock actuators, and wiring. Replace any faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the specific component that needs replacement.

*   **Dashboard Warning Lights (Erroneous)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Random warning lights illuminating on the dashboard with no apparent cause.
    *   Solution: Scan the vehicle's computer for error codes. Reset the system. Check and clean all electrical connections. A faulty sensor or module may be the cause.

**Summary**

The 2017 Fiat Ducato presents several potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly injector failure and EGR valve issues in the 2.3L Multijet II diesel, can lead to significant repair costs ranging from several hundred to over a thousand dollars. The Comfort-Matic transmission is prone to hesitation and jerky shifts, potentially requiring software updates or even costly rebuilds. Electrical glitches with the central locking system and dashboard warning lights are also common. While these issues can be concerning, being informed allows buyers to thoroughly inspect the vehicle, negotiate pricing accordingly, and budget for potential repairs. Overall, engine and transmission issues seem to be the most costly to fix, while interior and electrical issues tend to be less expensive. It is important to check for open recalls on the vehicle's VIN to ensure all safety-related issues are addressed.
