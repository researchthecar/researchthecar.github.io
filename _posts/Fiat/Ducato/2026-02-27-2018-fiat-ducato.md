### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Fiat Ducato demonstrates a generally solid reliability record for a commercial vehicle, with most reported issues being specific to certain engine variants or the automated transmission. The diesel engines, particularly the 2.0L and 2.3L MultiJet II, can experience issues with emissions systems like the EGR valve and DPF, which are common in modern diesels. The Comfort-Matic transmission, while convenient, has a higher potential for electrical and mechanical faults compared to the manual. Suspension components and general electrical issues like battery drain are also noted but are not considered widespread critical failures. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning emissions systems and timely clutch replacement for manual transmissions, is key to ensuring long-term reliability.
