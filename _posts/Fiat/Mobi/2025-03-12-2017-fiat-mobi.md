**Engine**

**1.0L Fire Evo Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the oil light illuminating, engine knocking due to low oil levels, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and using the recommended oil type. In severe cases, an engine inspection and potential piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the damage and the repair required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Train Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noises coming from the top of the engine, especially noticeable at idle or during cold starts. This can be caused by worn valve lifters or insufficient valve lash.
    *   Solution: Adjusting valve lash or replacing worn valve lifters. An inspection of the camshaft and other valve train components is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficult Shifting/Grinding Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging certain gears, especially first and second. Grinding noises can occur during gear changes. This can be caused by worn synchronizers or a clutch issue.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn synchronizers within the transmission, replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. Checking and adjusting the clutch cable is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1500+ depending on whether the synchronizers can be replaced or if a full transmission rebuild/replacement is necessary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, especially when accelerating in higher gears. This indicates a worn clutch disc.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report early wear of shock absorbers, struts, and bushings, leading to a bumpy ride, excessive body roll, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn shocks, struts, and bushings. Inspecting and replacing sway bar links and ball joints as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per axle, depending on the components replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Alignment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle pulling to one side, uneven tire wear, and steering wheel not centered.
    *   Solution: Performing a wheel alignment. Inspecting and replacing worn steering and suspension components may be necessary to maintain proper alignment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $75 - $200+ for alignment, additional costs for replacing worn parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or after short periods of inactivity, difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Testing the battery and charging system. Identifying and resolving parasitic drains (e.g., faulty relays, aftermarket accessories).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the cause of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with sensors (e.g., oxygen sensors, crankshaft position sensor) causing error codes, poor engine performance, and illuminated check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor using a diagnostic scan tool and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor, including diagnostic fees.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on body panels, especially in areas prone to moisture and salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Repairing affected areas by sanding, applying rust converter, and repainting. Applying rust prevention measures to undercarriage and vulnerable areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per panel, depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**
