### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Fiat Mobi is a budget-friendly city car with a generally acceptable reliability record for its class. The manual transmission variant appears to be the most robust. The automated manual (Dualogic) transmission is a notable area of concern, with potential for shifting issues and associated repair costs. Electrical gremlins, particularly battery drain and infotainment glitches, are also reported. Suspension components like bushings can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. While the engine and exterior/interior components are largely trouble-free, potential buyers should be aware of the transmission and electrical system's specific vulnerabilities.
