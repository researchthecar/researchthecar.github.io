Alright, here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2020 Fiat Mobi, formatted for your website. I've focused on typical problems beyond expected wear and tear and aimed for accuracy based on available data. Note that the Fiat Mobi is primarily sold in South America, so information readily available in English may be limited. I've done my best to gather relevant details from various sources.

The 2020 Fiat Mobi is a subcompact city car primarily aimed at the South American market, specifically Brazil. It typically comes with a 1.0-liter Fire Evo inline-four engine producing around 73-75 horsepower and 69 lb-ft of torque when running on gasoline (slightly more on ethanol). It's only offered with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the Mobi's compact size for navigating crowded urban environments and its fuel efficiency. Common complaints revolve around its limited power, basic features, and small cargo space. It's not designed for long-distance travel or carrying heavy loads.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the cause and severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idling Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling at idle, rough idling, or inconsistent RPM.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body, checking for vacuum leaks, and inspecting/replacing the idle air control valve (if equipped).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil pack failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, check engine light illuminated. Common to be caused by coil pack failure.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty coil pack, replace spark plugs

**Summary**

The 2020 Fiat Mobi, while a budget-friendly option, can present a few common issues. Engine oil consumption and transmission issues (particularly with the manual gearbox) appear to be the most significant concerns in terms of potential cost and inconvenience. Electrical problems with window regulators and central locking are also reported. Suspension bushing wear can lead to annoying noises and reduced handling precision. Most of these issues are relatively minor in terms of safety but can impact the overall driving experience and increase maintenance costs over time.
