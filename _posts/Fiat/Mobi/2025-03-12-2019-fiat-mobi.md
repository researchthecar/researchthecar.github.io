Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2019 Fiat Mobi, formatted for your website. Please note that due to the Fiat Mobi's primarily South American market focus, detailed and widely available US-style repair cost data is limited. Estimates are based on comparable repairs for similar vehicles and may vary considerably. The 2019 Fiat Mobi is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It came standard with a 1.0L Fire Evo inline-4 engine producing approximately 73 horsepower and 69 lb-ft of torque (when fueled with gasoline, horsepower is slightly higher with ethanol). It was typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise its compact size for city maneuverability and low running costs, but criticize its limited power, basic features, and somewhat rough ride quality. Other engine and transmission options were not available.

**Engine**

**1.0L Fire Evo Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil pressure light illuminating or the engine running noisily.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly is essential. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic should inspect for leaks, worn valve stem seals, or piston ring issues. An engine flush may also help. In severe cases, piston ring replacement or a more extensive engine rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (engine flush) - $1500+ (engine rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires can occur due to faulty ignition coils. This can result in rough idling, loss of power, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves identifying the faulty coil (or coils) and replacing them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per coil (plus labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners may experience difficulty engaging certain gears, particularly first or second. This can be accompanied by grinding noises.
    *   Solution: This can be caused by worn synchros, a damaged clutch, or issues with the shift linkage. Adjustment of the shift linkage might resolve minor issues. Clutch replacement or transmission repair/rebuild may be necessary for more severe problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (shift linkage adjustment) - $1200+ (clutch replacement or transmission rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage is common. This can be noticed by high RPMs with little acceleration, especially when going uphill.
    *   Solution: Replace clutch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps, can indicate worn suspension bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings). This can also lead to vague handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings is the standard fix. In some cases, replacing the entire control arm assembly may be more cost-effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per bushing/control arm (plus labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Fiat Mobi, like many modern vehicles, relies on various sensors. Failures of sensors (e.g., oxygen sensors, crankshaft position sensor, ABS sensors) can trigger the check engine light or other warning lights, and may affect engine performance or other vehicle systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis using a diagnostic scanner is required to pinpoint the faulty sensor. The sensor is then replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300 per sensor (plus labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tail Light Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the rear tail light housings crack and fail prematurely due to vibration.
    * Solution: Replacement of the tail light housing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per light (plus labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Rattles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, particularly on rough roads, are a common complaint.
    *   Solution: This often requires identifying the source of the rattle (loose trim, wiring, etc.) and securing it. This may involve adding foam padding or tightening fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on complexity).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Fiat Mobi, while affordable and fuel-efficient, appears to have some common issues relating to oil consumption, suspension, and interior rattles. While none of the issues seem to be major safety concerns, the cost to repair some engine and transmission issues can be significant. Owners should be diligent about regular maintenance and address any unusual noises or symptoms promptly to prevent more extensive damage.
