The 2019 Fiat Uno is a subcompact hatchback primarily sold in the South American market. It's known for its affordability, practicality, and compact size, making it suitable for urban environments. Engine options typically include a 1.0L Firefly inline-3 (around 72-77 hp and 75-77 lb-ft of torque depending on fuel type like gasoline or ethanol) and a 1.3L Firefly inline-4 (around 101-109 hp and 99-103 lb-ft of torque). The available transmissions are typically a 5-speed manual and an automated manual transmission (GSR). People often appreciate the Uno's fuel efficiency and ease of parking.
