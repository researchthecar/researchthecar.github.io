The 2015 Fiat Uno is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and practicality in urban environments. While it's praised for its maneuverability and compact size, some owners have reported certain issues. Engine options for the 2015 Fiat Uno in the Brazilian market include the 1.0L Fire Evo inline-4 (producing approximately 73-75 horsepower and 69 lb-ft of torque) and the 1.4L Fire Evo inline-4 (producing approximately 85-88 horsepower and 91 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or the Dualogic automated manual transmission. Common criticisms include the basic interior materials and limited cargo space.

**Engine**

**1.0L Fire Evo**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption between oil changes. Symptoms may include needing to add oil frequently and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and check for leaks. If consumption is excessive, consider a compression test to assess piston ring condition. The issue may require piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Unstable idling speed, engine shaking, and potential stalling at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Clean the throttle body and check/replace the spark plugs and ignition coils. Also, inspect the Mass Airflow (MAF) sensor and replace if needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Fire Evo**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from the water pump, radiator hoses, or the thermostat housing. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible leaks.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak. Replace faulty hoses, water pump, or thermostat housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported difficulty shifting into certain gears, especially 1st and 2nd. This may be due to worn synchros or a misaligned shifter linkage.
    *   Solution: Adjust or replace the shifter linkage. If the problem persists, the transmission may need to be disassembled and the synchros replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Dualogic Automated Manual**

*   **Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Dualogic transmission can exhibit jerky or abrupt shifting, particularly at low speeds. This is a common complaint with automated manual transmissions.
    *   Solution: Recalibrating the transmission control unit (TCU) can sometimes improve shift quality. In some cases, replacement of the clutch actuator or the entire transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report that the suspension bushings, particularly in the front control arms, wear out relatively quickly. This can lead to clunking noises, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings or the entire control arm assembly. Consider upgrading to polyurethane bushings for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power windows, often caused by a faulty window motor or switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor or switch. Check the wiring harness for any breaks or shorts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system may fail to lock or unlock the doors, either intermittently or completely. This could be caused by a faulty door lock actuator or a problem with the central locking module.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator or the central locking module. Check the wiring harness for any breaks or shorts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture build-up inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlight housing and dry it thoroughly. Seal any cracks or gaps in the housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100 (DIY or sealing services)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard material, usually due to prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard, or installation of a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Fiat Uno can present owners with a range of issues, from minor electrical problems to more significant engine and transmission concerns. The 1.0L engine has excessive oil consumption while the 1.4L engine is prone to coolant leaks. The Dualogic transmission is also prone to jerky shifting. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but some issues like premature bushing wear and power window problems are relatively inexpensive to address.
