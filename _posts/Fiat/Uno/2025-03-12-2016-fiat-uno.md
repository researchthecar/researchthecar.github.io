The 2016 Fiat Uno is a subcompact hatchback, primarily sold in South America. The engine options typically include a 1.0L Fire Evo inline-4 producing around 73 horsepower and 69 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.4L Fire Evo inline-4 producing around 85 horsepower and 90 lb-ft of torque, both usually paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Some owners appreciate its compact size for city driving, fuel efficiency, and affordability. Common complaints revolve around build quality, limited features, and relatively weak engine performance, especially when fully loaded.

**Engine**

**1.0L Fire Evo Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption between oil changes, leading to the need for frequent top-offs. Blue smoke from the exhaust pipe can be a symptom.
    *   Solution: Check for leaks. If leaks are not present, perform an oil consumption test and check the PCV valve and piston rings. If the piston rings are the issue, engine rebuild might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for PCV valve replacement. $1500 - $4000+ for engine rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idling Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Unstable or rough idling, potentially leading to stalling, especially when the engine is cold or under load (e.g., AC on).
    *   Solution: Clean the throttle body and Idle Air Control (IAC) valve. Check for vacuum leaks and inspect/replace the spark plugs and ignition coils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$150 for throttle body cleaning. $20-$100 for IAC valve replacement. $100 - $300 for replacing spark plugs and coils.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Fire Evo Inline-4**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning sensors (e.g., oxygen sensor, crankshaft position sensor) can trigger the check engine light and cause poor engine performance, reduced fuel economy, and starting issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor failure using an OBD-II scanner. Replace the faulty sensor with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+, depending on the sensor and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Difficulty Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty engaging gears, particularly 1st and 2nd. This can worsen over time and be more pronounced in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust the clutch cable. If the problem persists, inspect the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing for wear or damage. Consider replacing the clutch kit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$150 for clutch cable adjustment/replacement. $300-$800+ for clutch kit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPM rises disproportionately to vehicle speed during acceleration, indicating clutch slippage.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is typically required. This includes replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn suspension bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, stabilizer bar bushings) can cause clunking noises, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Inspect the suspension bushings for cracks, tears, or excessive play. Replace worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per bushing, plus labor for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking shock absorbers can result in a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shock absorbers in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per pair, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven frequently. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Check the charging system (alternator). Also, perform a parasitic draw test to identify any components that are drawing power when the vehicle is off.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 for alternator replacement. $50-$200+ for diagnosing and fixing parasitic draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the central locking system. Some doors may not lock or unlock properly.
    *   Solution: Check the wiring and connectors for the central locking system. Replace any faulty actuators or the central locking module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$150 for actuator replacement. $100-$300+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poor Quality Door Handles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the door handles breaking, especially in hotter climates where the plastic can become brittle.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken door handle. Aftermarket options may be available that are more durable than the original part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $30-$100+ per handle, depending on source (OEM vs. aftermarket) and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks over time, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dash cover, replacement of the entire dashboard is only necessary if there is other damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $25 - $100+ for dash cover. $500-$1500+ for a dash replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Infotainment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning radio or infotainment system, including screen failures, audio cutouts, or Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Check the wiring and connectors for the system. Update the software, if possible. If the problem persists, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$100 for wiring checks. $100-$500+ for unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Fiat Uno, while an affordable and practical city car, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most frequently reported problems involve the engine (oil consumption, sensor failures), transmission (shifting issues), and suspension (bushing wear). Electrical and interior issues are less common but still present. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, pay close attention to any unusual noises or symptoms, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic. The cost of fixing these issues can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the chosen repair shop.
