The 2013 Fiat Uno is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and fuel efficiency, particularly popular in South America. The 2013 models typically come with either a 1.0L Fire Evo four-cylinder engine (around 73-75 horsepower and 69 lb-ft of torque) or a 1.4L Fire four-cylinder engine (around 85-88 horsepower and 91 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Uno's compact size for city driving and its relatively low running costs. Common dislikes include its basic interior, somewhat underpowered engines, and limited features compared to more modern cars.

**Summary:**

The 2013 Fiat Uno has a mix of minor and moderate issues. The engine and transmission issues can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing ignition coils or adjusting shift linkages to more costly repairs like addressing oil consumption or transmission synchronizers. Suspension and electrical problems are also relatively common and can add to the overall cost of ownership. While none of the issues are typically catastrophic, they can be a nuisance and should be considered when evaluating a used 2013 Fiat Uno. The severity of the issues can range from minor inconveniences to more substantial repairs, with repair costs varying accordingly.
