The 2015 Fiat 500 is a small, stylish city car known for its retro design and fuel efficiency. The base engine is a 1.4L MultiAir inline-4 producing 101 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque. An Abarth version is available with a turbocharged 1.4L engine making 160 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. People appreciate the Fiat 500 for its unique styling, compact size, and affordability. However, some criticisms include its cramped rear seats, limited cargo space, and relatively underpowered base engine.

**Engine**

**1.4L MultiAir Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms can include the low oil pressure light illuminating, engine knocking, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The best solution would be to inspect the engine for signs of leaks, such as valve cover gaskets, the oil pan gasket, or the front and rear main seals. Repair any leaks that are found and continue monitoring the oil level. If the consumption continues, a more in-depth inspection of the piston rings and valve seals is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the source of the leak and the extent of repairs needed. A full engine rebuild is the worst-case scenario)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **MultiAir Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MultiAir system controls valve lift and timing. Failure can lead to rough idling, misfires, loss of power, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MultiAir actuator assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Turbocharged MultiAir Inline-4 (Abarth)**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turbo lag, boost leaks, or complete turbocharger failure. Symptoms include a loss of power, unusual noises (whining, whistling), and the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the turbocharger system for leaks, damage, or wear. Repair or replace the turbocharger as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ (depending on whether it's a repair or full replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, unusual noises (grinding, squealing) when engaging the clutch.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement, including the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, hesitation when accelerating, and occasional transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the issue persists, further diagnosis may be required, potentially leading to valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the severity and the parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A creaking or popping noise from the front suspension when turning or going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front strut mounts.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as malfunctioning lights, power windows, or door locks. The check engine light may also illuminate.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the BCM. Reprogramming or replacement of the BCM may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+

**Summary**

The 2015 Fiat 500, while stylish and fun to drive, does have some common issues owners have reported. Engine problems, such as excessive oil consumption and MultiAir actuator failure, can be costly to address. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can also lead to unexpected repairs. Other notable problems include suspension noise, electrical glitches, and exterior door handle failures. The severity of these issues varies, but they can result in repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchasing.
