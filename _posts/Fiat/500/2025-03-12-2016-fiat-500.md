The 2016 Fiat 500 is a stylish and compact city car known for its retro-inspired design and nimble handling. Itâ€™s generally appreciated for its fuel efficiency and ease of parking in tight spaces. However, some owners find the rear seats cramped and the cargo space limited. The base engine is a 1.4L MultiAir inline-4 producing 101 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque. A turbocharged version of the 1.4L MultiAir engine, delivering 135 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, is available on the 500 Turbo and Abarth models. The 1.4L base engine can be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the turbocharged version also offers these two transmission options.

**Summary**

The 2016 Fiat 500, while charming in its design and driving experience, can suffer from a range of issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the base engine and turbocharger failures in the turbocharged variant, can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, such as rough shifting and slipping in the automatic transmission, are also frequently reported. Electrical gremlins in the radio and power windows can be frustrating. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, engine and transmission repairs can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, including budgeting for potential maintenance and repairs.
