### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Fiat 500 offers a stylish and economical package, but potential buyers should be aware of its reliability quirks. The petrol engines (1.2L and 1.4L) are generally robust, while the Multijet diesel can experience issues with the turbocharger and EGR valve. The automated manual Dualogic transmission is a common source of complaints due to actuator and pump failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern on older models, and interior wear on seats is also noted. Despite these points, many owners find the 500 to be a charming and generally manageable city car, provided regular maintenance and prompt attention to emerging issues.
