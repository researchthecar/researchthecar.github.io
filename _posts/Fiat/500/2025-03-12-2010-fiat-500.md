The 2010 Fiat 500 marked the return of the iconic Italian city car to the North American market. This model year featured a single engine option: a 1.4-liter MultiAir inline-four producing approximately 101 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Fiat 500 for its distinctive retro styling, fuel efficiency, and nimble handling, making it well-suited for urban environments. Common criticisms include the limited rear seat space, small cargo area, and some reliability concerns.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can manifest as the need to add a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less. Blue smoke may also be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, addressing the PCV valve or other minor leaks might help. More severe cases could necessitate piston ring replacement or engine overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV valve) - $2,000+ (engine overhaul)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light are common symptoms. The engine may run poorly or stall. Diagnostic codes will typically indicate a misfire on a specific cylinder.
