The 2012 Fiat 500 is a subcompact car known for its stylish Italian design, fuel efficiency, and nimble handling. It's available with a 1.4-liter MultiAir inline-4 engine, producing 101 horsepower and 97 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. People generally appreciate the 500 for its unique looks, ease of parking in urban environments, and relatively low price point. However, common complaints revolve around its small size (particularly limited rear seat space and cargo capacity), ride quality on rough roads, and reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2012 Fiat 500, while stylish and fun to drive, does present some reliability concerns for potential buyers. Engine issues, particularly excessive oil consumption and MultiAir actuator failures, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic variant, also warrant careful inspection. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix (door handles, sun visors), others can be quite costly (engine or transmission rebuilds/replacements). The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially debilitating mechanical failures. It's crucial for prospective buyers to thoroughly inspect any 2012 Fiat 500, obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic, and be aware of the potential repair costs involved.
