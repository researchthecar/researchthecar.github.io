### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Fiat 500, while stylish and economical for city driving, exhibits some common reliability concerns. The 1.4L engines, particularly the MultiAir variants, can be prone to oil leaks and module failures. The automatic Dualogic transmission has also seen reports of control module and hydraulic pump issues. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can appear on lower body panels, and interior wear on high-traffic areas like seat bolsters is also noted. While many issues are repairable, potential buyers should factor in the possibility of these repairs when considering a 2019 Fiat 500, especially if purchasing used.
