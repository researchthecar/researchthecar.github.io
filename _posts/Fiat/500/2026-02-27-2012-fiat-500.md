# 2012 Fiat 500

### Overview
The 2012 Fiat 500, a stylish subcompact car, generally presents a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. While its charming design and city-friendly nature are appealing, certain mechanical and electrical components have shown a propensity for issues. Owners often report a higher-than-average incidence of problems, particularly concerning the powertrain and electrical systems. However, many of these issues are not catastrophic and can be addressed with timely maintenance and repairs. The car's smaller size and simpler mechanicals can sometimes translate to lower repair costs compared to larger, more complex vehicles, but the frequency of these repairs is a factor to consider for potential buyers.
