### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Fiat 500 is a charming car with some notable reliability concerns, particularly in its electrical system and certain engine variants like the TwinAir and diesel engines. Owners should be prepared for potential issues with window regulators, sensors, and DPF systems. The automated manual transmission (Dualogic) can also be a source of problems.

Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the 500's style and city-driving prowess outweigh the reliability risks.
