Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2014 Fiat 500, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration. The 2014 Fiat 500 is a small, stylish city car known for its retro design and nimble handling. However, it also has its share of reported problems. The base engine is a 1.4L MultiAir inline-4, producing 101 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque. A turbocharged version of this engine is available on the 500 Turbo and 500 Abarth models, significantly increasing power. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the 500's fuel efficiency and unique appearance, but some find the ride quality harsh and the interior cramped.

**Engine**

**1.4L MultiAir Inline-4 (Non-Turbo)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report high oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be indicated by the low oil pressure warning light coming on intermittently. Some have experienced the engine burning through a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the engine control unit (ECU) may help reduce oil consumption. More severe cases may require replacing piston rings or other internal engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **MultiAir Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MultiAir system, which controls valve timing, is prone to failure. Symptoms include rough idling, misfires, loss of power, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic codes related to the MultiAir system will be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MultiAir actuator/solenoid unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

*   **Boost Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, hissing sounds under acceleration, poor fuel economy. Likely caused by cracked or loose boost hoses.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace damaged boost hoses and ensure proper connections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt and jarring shifts, especially between lower gears.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush may temporarily alleviate the issue. More serious cases may require valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**

**Summary**

The 2014 Fiat 500, while stylish and fuel-efficient, has several reported issues. The most significant problems revolve around the engine, particularly excessive oil consumption and MultiAir actuator failure in the 1.4L engine.
