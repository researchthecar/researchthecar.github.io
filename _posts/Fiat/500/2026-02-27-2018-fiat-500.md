### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Fiat 500 offers a unique driving experience but comes with a few reliability caveats. The 1.4L engines, both naturally aspirated and turbocharged, can be susceptible to oil leaks and, in the case of the turbo, potential turbocharger issues. The MultiAir system itself can also present problems. Automatic transmissions have occasionally been reported to exhibit harsh shifting. Suspension components like struts and shocks may require attention sooner than on some competitors. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and power windows, are also noted. While not a universally problematic vehicle, prospective buyers should be prepared for potential repairs in these specific areas, especially as the car ages. Regular and diligent maintenance is crucial for mitigating some of these concerns.
