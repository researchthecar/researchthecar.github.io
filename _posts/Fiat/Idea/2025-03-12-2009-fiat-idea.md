The 2009 Fiat Idea is a mini MPV known for its practical interior, comfortable ride, and compact size, making it suitable for city driving. Engine options for the 2009 Fiat Idea included several gasoline and diesel variants. One common petrol option was the 1.4-liter FIRE engine, producing around 77 horsepower and 85 lb-ft of torque. Diesel options included the 1.3-liter Multijet and 1.6-liter Multijet engines. Transmission choices generally consisted of a 5-speed manual and sometimes a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine. What owners typically appreciate about the Idea is its spacious interior for its size, good visibility, and ease of parking. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated styling, average performance from the base engine, and potential for electrical gremlins.
