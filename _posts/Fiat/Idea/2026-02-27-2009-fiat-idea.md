### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Fiat Idea presents a mixed reliability profile. The 1.9L JTDm diesel engine is prone to common diesel issues like DPF and EGR valve problems, which can be costly to repair. The Dualogic automated manual transmission also has a known weakness with its actuator. Electrical components, particularly window regulators and sensors, can also be a source of concern. However, the petrol engine and manual transmission options appear more robust. Interior components may suffer from typical age-related issues like rattles. Overall, while the Idea offers practicality, potential buyers should be aware of these specific reliability concerns, especially if considering the diesel or Dualogic variants.
