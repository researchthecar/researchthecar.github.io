### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Fiat Idea demonstrates a mixed reliability profile. The petrol engines (1.2L and 1.4L Fire) and manual transmissions are generally robust with few reported issues. However, the 1.9L JTDm diesel engine is more prone to problems, particularly with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and EGR valve, which can lead to significant repair costs. The automated manual Dualogic transmission also presents a potential weak point with actuator failures. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module, can also occur. While the exterior and interior components are typically reliable, potential buyers should be aware of the specific issues associated with the diesel engine and the Dualogic gearbox.
