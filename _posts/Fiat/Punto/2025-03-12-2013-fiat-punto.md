The 2013 Fiat Punto is a subcompact car known for its stylish Italian design, relatively affordable price point, and nimble handling. Engine options for the 2013 Punto in many markets (including Europe) included a range of petrol and diesel engines. One of the more common options was the 1.4-liter naturally aspirated petrol engine, producing around 77 horsepower and 85 lb-ft of torque. People generally liked the Punto for its aesthetics and city-friendly size, but criticisms often focused on its somewhat dated interior, lack of advanced technology, and sometimes questionable reliability.
