The 2022 Fiat Argo is a subcompact hatchback primarily sold in South American markets. Engine options typically include a 1.0L 3-cylinder Firefly engine producing around 77 horsepower and 79 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3L 4-cylinder Firefly engine delivering approximately 109 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. Available transmissions are generally a 5-speed manual and a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often praise the Argo for its fuel efficiency, modern styling, and relatively spacious interior for its class. Common complaints revolve around the engine's somewhat limited power, especially with the 1.0L variant, the ride quality on rough roads, and the availability of spare parts in some regions.

**Summary**

The 2022 Fiat Argo, while appreciated for its style and economy, appears to have some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 1.0L variant, and transmission quirks in the CVT can cause drivability concerns. Suspension issues and electrical glitches with the infotainment system are also prevalent. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others can be more costly, especially if involving transmission or engine component replacements. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints to make an informed decision.
