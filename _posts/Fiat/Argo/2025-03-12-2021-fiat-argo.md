The 2021 Fiat Argo is a subcompact hatchback known for its stylish design and fuel efficiency. In the Brazilian market, it came with a few engine and transmission options. One of the most common engine choices was the 1.0L Firefly inline-three, producing around 77 horsepower and 79 lb-ft of torque when running on ethanol (slightly less on gasoline). Other engine options include a 1.3L Firefly inline-four, and a 1.8L E.torQ inline-four. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Argo's comfortable ride and modern interior, but some criticize its relatively small rear seats and limited cargo space. The 1.0L engine is generally known for its fuel efficiency and sufficient power for city driving, but its acceleration can be perceived as slow.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, especially on vehicles with higher mileage. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently than usual, low oil level warnings, and, in severe cases, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and use the manufacturer-recommended oil type and viscosity. If consumption is excessive, inspect for leaks, worn valve stem seals, or piston ring issues. Replacement of these components may be necessary.
