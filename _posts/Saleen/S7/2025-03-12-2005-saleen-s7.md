The 2005 Saleen S7 is a hand-built, high-performance American supercar. It's most known for its stunning aesthetics and potent performance. The S7 features a mid-mounted, naturally aspirated 7.0L Ford 427 V8 engine producing 550 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque. No other engine options were available for the 2005 model year. It comes exclusively with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners rave about the car's unique design, exclusivity, and exhilarating performance. Criticisms often involve its high maintenance costs, challenging drivability at low speeds, and limited practicality due to its low ground clearance and stiff suspension.
