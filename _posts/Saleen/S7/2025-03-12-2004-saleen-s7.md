The 2004 Saleen S7 is a hand-built, high-performance American supercar. The heart of this beast is a naturally aspirated 7.0L (427 cu in) Ford 351 Windsor-derived V8 engine producing 550 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque. This engine is mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often rave about the S7's striking design, incredible performance, and exclusivity. However, some common criticisms include its harsh ride, limited practicality, and high maintenance costs, characteristic of a low-volume, high-performance vehicle.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficult Shifting/Grinding Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, especially when cold, or grinding noises during shifting. This can be due to worn synchronizers, a failing clutch, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn synchronizers, clutch replacement, or transmission fluid change.

**Summary**

The 2004 Saleen S7, while a remarkable vehicle, can present some unique challenges due to its low production numbers and hand-built nature. Engine oil leaks and transmission issues are common concerns. Additionally, owners should be aware of potential issues with the suspension, electrical system, and carbon fiber body panels. The cost to address these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for major component replacements, making it important to factor in potential maintenance costs when considering purchasing one of these vehicles.
