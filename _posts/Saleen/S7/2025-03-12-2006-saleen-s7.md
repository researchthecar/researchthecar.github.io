The 2006 Saleen S7 is a mid-engine, high-performance sports car that represents a pinnacle of American automotive engineering. Equipped with a 7.0L (427ci) naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 550 horsepower and 520 lb-ft of torque, the S7 offers blistering acceleration and a raw driving experience. Some appreciate the S7 for its striking design, exclusivity, and track-focused performance. Criticisms often revolve around its limited practicality, stiff ride, and high maintenance costs. The S7 was only available with a 6-speed manual transmission.

**Engine**

**7.0L Naturally Aspirated V8**

*   **Engine Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of the engine overheating, especially during high-performance driving or in warmer climates. Can be caused by a failing thermostat, water pump, or radiator issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty components. Could include replacing the thermostat, water pump, or radiator, or potentially servicing the cooling system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the part and labor costs

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various engine seals and gaskets.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected seals and gaskets. This may require significant engine disassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the source of the leak.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Clutch Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The original clutch assembly may not be able to handle the torque of the 7.0L V8, especially with aggressive driving.
    * Solution: Replacing the clutch with a stronger aftermarket unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the clutch kit and labor.

*   **Hard Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, particularly at higher RPMs. This may be due to worn synchros or a misaligned shifter linkage.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission with upgraded components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Stiff Ride**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S7's suspension is designed for performance, resulting in a very stiff and unforgiving ride on public roads. This can be uncomfortable for daily driving.
    *   Solution: No direct fix, as it's inherent to the car's design. Some owners may explore aftermarket suspension components to slightly improve ride quality, but this can compromise handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A, unless upgrading to aftermarket parts
*   **Damper Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The high performance dampers have been known to fail prematurely. This can lead to a bouncy ride or poor handling.
    * Solution: Replacing the dampers with new or upgraded aftermarket performance dampers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ depending on the dampers and labor.

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as O2 sensors, crankshaft position sensors, or mass airflow sensors, can fail, causing engine performance issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor failure and replace the faulty unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the sensor.
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the car is not driven regularly.
    *   Solution: Investigate potential parasitic draws and repair any faulty circuits. May also require a new battery or a battery tender.
