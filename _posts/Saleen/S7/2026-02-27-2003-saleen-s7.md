### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Saleen S7, while a remarkable supercar, is not without its potential issues, though they are often related to its exotic nature and performance focus rather than inherent design flaws. The twin-turbocharged V8, while powerful, can present challenges with turbo lag and heat management, requiring specialized tuning and cooling solutions. The manual transmission, though robust, can experience clutch wear and synchronization issues over time. Electrical gremlins and cosmetic wear on the carbon fiber body and interior are also noted. Due to its rarity and specialized components, maintenance and repairs are invariably expensive and demand expert attention. Owners should expect significant costs associated with keeping this supercar in peak condition.
