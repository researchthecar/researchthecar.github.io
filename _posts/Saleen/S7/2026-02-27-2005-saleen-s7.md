# 2005 Saleen S7

### Overview
The 2005 Saleen S7 is a rare and exotic supercar, known for its extreme performance and bespoke construction. As such, reliability data is less standardized than for mass-produced vehicles. The S7 was built in limited numbers, often with bespoke components and hand-built assembly. This means that while individual components might be robust, the rarity of the vehicle makes widespread issue tracking challenging. Owners often rely on specialized Saleen technicians or highly skilled independent shops for maintenance and repairs. The focus is on high-performance parts, which can be costly to replace or repair when issues do arise, though documented widespread failures are uncommon due to its exclusive nature.

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Saleen S7, being an ultra-exclusive supercar, does not have the extensive reliability data of a mainstream vehicle. Issues that do arise are typically related to its high-performance, specialized components, such as the twin-turbo V8 engine, Ricardo transmission, and bespoke suspension and electrical systems. Failures are not widespread, but when they occur, repairs can be complex and expensive, often requiring specialized knowledge and parts. Owners should expect higher maintenance costs and potential for unique, infrequent issues due to the car's exotic nature and limited production run. Regular, expert maintenance is crucial for preserving its performance and reliability.
