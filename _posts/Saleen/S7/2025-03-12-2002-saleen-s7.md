The 2002 Saleen S7 is a hand-built, high-performance American supercar. It was originally equipped with a naturally aspirated 7.0L Ford 427 V8 engine producing 550 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. Later versions were upgraded with twin turbos. People appreciate the S7 for its striking design, exclusivity, and impressive performance capabilities. Criticisms often revolve around the high cost of maintenance and the car's relatively spartan interior for a vehicle in its price range.
