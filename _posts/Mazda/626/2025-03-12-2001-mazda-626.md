The 2001 Mazda 626 is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability and comfortable ride. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing approximately 130 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L V6 engine producing approximately 170 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the 626 for its smooth engine, comfortable interior, and overall value. Common complaints often revolved around minor electrical issues, rust, and the age-related wear and tear that affects vehicles of this era.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common in older vehicles, often stemming from the valve cover gasket or the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine or ground, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, a rattling noise from underneath the car, and a "check engine" light with codes indicating catalytic converter inefficiency (e.g., P0420).
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**2.5L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.0L, oil leaks are common, often from valve cover gaskets (especially at the rear of the engine), oil pan gasket, or front crankshaft seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket(s) or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $75 - $300+

*   **Timing Belt Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.5L V6 is an interference engine, meaning a broken timing belt can cause significant internal engine damage (bent valves, damaged pistons). Symptoms include engine not starting, rough running prior to failure, or a ticking/knocking noise.
    *   Solution: Regular timing belt replacement (every 60,000 - 90,000 miles). If the belt breaks and causes damage, a complete engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Timing belt replacement: $300 - $600. Engine repair/replacement: $1500 - $4000+

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vacuum leaks can develop due to the intake manifold gasket degrading. This leads to poor idling, hesitation, and possibly a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, particularly when cold.
    *   Solution: Often caused by old or contaminated transmission fluid. A fluid flush and filter change may help. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change: $100 - $250. Valve body repair: $300 - $800. Transmission rebuild: $1500 - $3500+

*   **Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs up without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, or the transmission hesitates to engage a gear.
    *   Solution: Often a sign of internal transmission wear. Could be caused by low fluid level, worn clutches, or a failing torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change (if low): $100 - $250. Transmission rebuild or replacement: $1500 - $4000+

**5-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll in corners, and nose-diving during braking.
    *   Solution: Replace the struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per axle

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially over bumps. Can also affect handling and tire wear. Common culprits include control arm bushings and sway bar bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the bushing and labor involved

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, working intermittently, or moving slowly. Often caused by a failing window motor or switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the window motor or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

*   **Central Locking Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Central locking system not working, doors not locking or unlocking properly with the remote or switch.
    *   Solution: Check fuses and wiring. Could be a faulty door lock actuator or central locking module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $75 - $300+ depending on the component

*   **Check Engine Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light on for a variety of reasons. Needs to be scanned with an OBDII scanner to determine the cause.
    *   Solution: Address the specific issue indicated by the diagnostic code.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the problem.

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the body panels, especially around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and door sills.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the severity and location.

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking and warping of the dashboard due to prolonged exposure to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dashboard cover: $50 - $150. Dashboard replacement: $500 - $1500+

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof failing to open or close properly, getting stuck, or leaking.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the tracks and mechanisms. If that doesn't work, the sunroof motor or assembly may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Recalls**
*Recalls:*

*   **01V203000** - The accelerator pedal may become stuck in the depressed position.

**Summary**

The 2001 Mazda 626, while generally reliable, is prone to age-related issues. Engine and transmission problems, particularly oil leaks and harsh shifting, are common and can range in cost from relatively inexpensive repairs to more significant expenses like engine or transmission rebuilds. Suspension wear is also typical, affecting ride quality and handling. Electrical issues like power window failures and central locking problems are also seen. Rust is a concern in many regions. Overall, while a well-maintained 2001 Mazda 626 can be a good value, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of these issues varies, but many are manageable with preventative maintenance and timely repairs.
