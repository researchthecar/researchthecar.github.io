The 2000 Mazda 626 was a mid-size sedan known for its reliability and affordability. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 producing approximately 125 hp and 132 lb-ft of torque and a 2.5L V6 producing approximately 170 hp and 163 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically appreciated the 626 for its comfortable ride, decent fuel economy, and value for money. Common dislikes included somewhat bland styling and a less sporty driving experience compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2000 Mazda 626 is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any older car, it is prone to certain issues. Oil leaks are common across both engine options. Automatic transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting, are also frequently reported. Suspension components wear with age, leading to ride and handling problems. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure and power window malfunctions, can also occur. Rust is also a concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the severity of the problem and the location, but some repairs, such as transmission work, can be expensive.
