**Introduction**

The 2002 Mazda 626 is a midsize sedan that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The base engine was a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produced 125 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine was a 2.5-liter V6 that produced 170 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The 626 was praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and affordability. However, it was also criticized for its lack of performance, especially with the base four-cylinder engine.

**Engine**

* **Timing Belt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The timing belt is a critical component that synchronizes the timing of the engine's valves and pistons. If the timing belt fails, it can cause serious engine damage. Symptoms of a failing timing belt include difficulty starting the engine, rough idling, and loss of power.
    * Solution: The timing belt must be replaced immediately if it is found to be worn or damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

* **Transmission Line Leakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission lines are responsible for carrying fluid to and from the transmission. If a transmission line leaks, it can cause the transmission to lose fluid and become damaged. Symptoms of a transmission line leak include slipping gears, difficulty shifting, and a burning smell.
    * Solution: The leaking transmission line must be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200

    * Description/Symptoms: The rear shock absorbers are responsible for dampening the impact of bumps and vibrations. If a rear shock absorber fails, it can cause the vehicle to ride rough and handle poorly. Symptoms of a failing rear shock absorber include a rough ride, excessive bouncing, and difficulty controlling the vehicle on uneven surfaces.
    * Solution: The failed rear shock absorber must be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per side

    * Solution: The dashboard can be replaced, but it is a labor-intensive process.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Mazda 626 is a reliable and affordable midsize sedan. However, it does have some potential issues that buyers should be aware of, such as the timing belt failure on the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but overall, the 626 is a good value for the money.
