The 2002 Mazda 626 was a mid-size sedan known for its reliability and comfortable ride. Two engine options were available: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 130 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L V6 producing 170 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciated the 626's smooth handling, spacious interior, and relatively low maintenance costs. However, some common complaints included uninspired styling, limited rear legroom, and a somewhat bland driving experience.

**Summary**

The 2002 Mazda 626, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to watch out for. Engine oil leaks and potential camshaft position sensor failures (V6) are concerns. Transmission issues with the 4-speed automatic can be costly. Suspension components like strut mounts and sway bar links are prone to wear. Electrical problems like power window motor and alternator failures can arise. Rust on the rear wheel wells is a common concern, as is interior wear like a cracked dashboard or sagging headliner. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
