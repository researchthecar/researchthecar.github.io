**Introduction**

The 1997 Mazda 626 is a midsize sedan that was offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 2.0-liter inline-four that produced 125 horsepower and 130 pound-feet of torque. The optional engine was a 2.5-liter V6 that produced 170 horsepower and 160 pound-feet of torque. Both engines were available with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The 626 was praised for its sporty handling, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, especially with the base engine.
