The 2012 Mazda 3 is a popular compact car known for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and stylish design. It came with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter inline-4 generating 167 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic with the 2.0L engine, and a 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic with the 2.5L engine. Owners often praise the Mazda 3 for its engaging driving dynamics and responsive steering. Common complaints include road noise, some interior materials feeling cheap, and potential reliability issues as the car ages.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**
*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, difficulty starting after refueling, rough idling.
    *   Solution: Replace the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine burns oil at a rate higher than expected, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: There are several potential solutions depending on the cause, ranging from replacing valve stem seals and piston rings to more extensive engine work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**
*   **Rough Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or clunking noises during shifting, especially between gears, and a delay in engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Typically involves a transmission fluid flush, replacement of worn solenoids, or, in severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This often indicates worn sway bar bushings or end links.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings and/or end links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) light illuminated on the dashboard, indicating a sensor malfunction. Individual tire pressure readings may be inaccurate or unavailable.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty TPMS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per sensor (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure, car unable to start after sitting for a short period. May be due to parasitic draw on the battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw (e.g., faulty module, improperly installed aftermarket accessory) and repair or replace the component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Formation of rust on the rear wheel arches, particularly in areas with heavy road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, patching, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per wheel arch (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning system blowing warm air, reduced cooling performance.
    *   Solution: Could be due to a refrigerant leak, faulty compressor, or other component failures. Diagnosis and repair of the specific issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (recharge) - $1000+ (compressor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Mazda 3 is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it has its potential issues. The most common problems involve the engine (purge valve, oil consumption), transmission (rough shifting), and suspension (noises). Electrical issues like TPMS sensor failures and battery drain can also occur. Rust, particularly on the rear wheel arches, is a concern in some areas. The severity and cost of these issues vary greatly, ranging from relatively minor repairs like replacing a purge valve ($100 - $200) to more expensive fixes like transmission rebuilds ($3000+) or extensive engine work for oil consumption issues. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic.
