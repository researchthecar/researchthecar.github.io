Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2016 Mazda 3, formatted for your website.

The 2016 Mazda 3 is a compact car known for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and attractive styling. It was available as a sedan or hatchback. The base engine is a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, while an upgraded 2.5-liter inline-4 produces 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often praise the Mazda 3 for its responsive steering, well-designed interior, and overall value. Common dislikes include road noise and a sometimes-stiff ride, especially with larger wheel options.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil pressure light illuminating, or the engine running rough due to low oil.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is crucial. Some owners have had success switching to a different oil type or viscosity. In more severe cases, engine components like piston rings may need replacement to address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $3,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

Suspension noise is another fairly common issue. The severity of these problems varies, and costs can range from minor repairs to more substantial engine or transmission work. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are recommended.
