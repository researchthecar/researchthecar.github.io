It offers two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-four producing 148 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission; and a 2.3-liter inline-four producing 160 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission.

Drivers appreciate the Mazda 3's sporty handling, responsive steering, and well-designed interior. However, some have reported concerns with its reliability and certain components.

**Engine:**

**2.0-liter Inline-Four**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption:** Description/Symptoms: Burning excessive amounts of oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. Solution: Replacing the piston rings can resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
* **EGR Valve Failure:** Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning of the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve, causing engine performance issues, increased emissions, and potential engine damage. Solution: Replacing the faulty EGR valve is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800

**2.3-liter Inline-Four**

* **VVT Actuator Failure:** Description/Symptoms: Failure of the variable valve timing (VVT) actuator, leading to reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, and potential engine damage. Solution: Replacing the VVT actuator is the recommended solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200
* **Timing Belt Tensioner Failure:** Description/Symptoms: Failure of the timing belt tensioner, leading to slipping or breakage of the timing belt and potential catastrophic engine damage. Solution: Replacing the timing belt tensioner and timing belt is crucial. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,500+

**Transmission:**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Shudder:** Description/Symptoms: Vibrations and shuddering during acceleration or at low speeds, indicating a faulty torque converter. Solution: Replacing the torque converter is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Master Cylinder Failure:** Description/Symptoms: Failure of the clutch master cylinder, resulting in difficulty shifting gears or complete clutch failure. Solution: Replacing the clutch master cylinder is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800

**Suspension:**

* **Strut Mount Noise:** Description/Symptoms: Noisy strut mounts, causing rattling or clunking sounds during suspension movement. Solution: Replacing the strut mounts can eliminate the noise. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Electrical:**

* **Alternator Failure:** Description/Symptoms: Failure of the alternator, leading to charging system issues, battery depletion, and potential electrical system failure. Solution: Replacing the alternator is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Battery Drain:** Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery discharge when the vehicle is parked, indicating a potential electrical drain from parasitic loads. Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the electrical drain is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the issue

**Exterior:**

* **Clear Coat Peeling:** Description/Symptoms: Peeling or flaking of the clear coat on the vehicle's exterior, exposing the underlying paint. Solution: Repairing or repainting the affected areas is recommended. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

**Interior:**

* **Sun Visor Sagging:** Description/Symptoms: Sagging or drooping sun visors, impeding visibility and posing a safety concern. Solution: Replacing the faulty sun visors is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250

**Summary:**

The 2005 Mazda 3 exhibits varying reliability concerns across its components. Key issues include excessive oil consumption, EGR valve failure, VVT actuator failure, timing belt tensioner failure, torque converter shudder, clutch master cylinder failure, strut mount noise, alternator failure, clear coat peeling, and sun visor sagging. These issues range in severity and cost to fix, potentially affecting the overall ownership experience.
