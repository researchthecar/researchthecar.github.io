The 2014 Mazda 3 is a compact car that was praised for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and stylish design. It was available as a sedan and a hatchback. Two engine options were offered: a 2.0-liter Skyactiv-G inline-4 producing 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque and a 2.5-liter Skyactiv-G inline-4 producing 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Mazda 3's responsive steering, comfortable ride, and upscale interior for its class. Some common complaints included the infotainment system being less intuitive than competitors and some road noise.

**Summary**

The 2014 Mazda 3 generally offers a reliable driving experience, but some owners have reported issues with the engine (purge valve and oil consumption), transmission (shuddering), suspension (rear noises), electrical system (infotainment glitches and battery drain), and interior (dashboard cracks). The severity and cost of these issues vary, ranging from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing a purge valve or sway bar bushings to more costly repairs such as torque converter replacement or addressing excessive oil consumption. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
