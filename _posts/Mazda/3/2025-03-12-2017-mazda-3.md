The 2017 Mazda 3 is a popular compact car known for its sporty handling, attractive styling, and fuel efficiency. It comes in both sedan and hatchback body styles. The base engine is a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. An upgrade option is a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Drivers appreciate the Mazda 3 for its engaging driving dynamics, comfortable interior, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some common complaints include a somewhat firm ride, road noise at highway speeds, and limited rear passenger space.
