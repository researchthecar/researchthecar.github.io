### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mazda 3 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly with the 2.0L engine and manual transmission. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil leaks and VVT actuator problems on the 2.0L, and oil consumption on the 2.3L. Automatic transmissions may develop harsh shifting over time. Suspension components like control arm bushings and wheel bearings are common wear items. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can occur. Exterior rust, especially in rust-belt regions, and interior wear on seat bolsters are also noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of these issues can significantly mitigate repair costs and ensure continued reliability.
