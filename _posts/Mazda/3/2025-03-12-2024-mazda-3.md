The 2024 Mazda 3 is a popular compact car known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. It's available as a sedan or hatchback and offers a premium feel compared to some of its competitors. Common praises include its responsive handling, comfortable seats, and attractive interior design. Criticisms often revolve around the limited rear seat space and somewhat smaller cargo capacity, especially in the sedan. For the 2024 model year, the Mazda 3 offers a choice between two engine options: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 191 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque (on premium fuel). Both engines are available with a six-speed automatic transmission. A six-speed manual transmission is also available on the hatchback version with the naturally aspirated engine. All-wheel drive is an available option on select trims.
