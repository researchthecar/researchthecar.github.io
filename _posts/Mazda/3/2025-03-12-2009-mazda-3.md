The 2009 Mazda 3 is a compact car known for its sporty handling, responsive steering, and overall fun-to-drive character. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.3-liter inline-4 generating 156 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque.
