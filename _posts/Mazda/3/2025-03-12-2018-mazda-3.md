The 2018 Mazda 3 is a compact car appreciated for its sporty handling, stylish design, and upscale interior for its class. It came with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.5-liter inline-4 generating 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often praise the Mazda 3 for its engaging driving experience and fuel efficiency, but some common complaints include road noise and a somewhat small rear seat.

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to potential engine damage if not monitored and addressed.
    *   Solution: While some cases might be attributed to driving habits, others could indicate issues with piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the cause. Depending on the diagnosis, the fix could involve replacing piston rings and/or valve stem seals.

    *   Solution: Start with a system reset by holding down the volume, mute, and navigation buttons for a few seconds. Updating the infotainment software to the latest version can also resolve some issues. In some cases, the CMU (Connectivity Master Unit) module might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (system reset) - $800+ (CMU replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) System Malfunctions**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling from Dashboard or Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises originating from the dashboard or door panels, especially on rough roads.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Mazda 3 is a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, rough shifting in the automatic transmission, and occasional infotainment system malfunctions. Rattling noises within the cabin are also a common complaint. While some issues are minor and easily addressed, others like excessive oil consumption can lead to more costly repairs if left unchecked. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing. The severity of these issues is mild to moderate, with repair costs ranging from a few dollars to several thousand dollars depending on the issue.
