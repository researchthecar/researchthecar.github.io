### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mazda 3 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly for its class and age. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the engine (oil leaks, VVT solenoid on the 2.0L, oil consumption on 2.3L), transmission (clutch wear on manual, shifting issues on automatic), and some suspension components like sway bar links and strut mounts. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure or BCM glitches, can also occur. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates. While these issues are documented, they are not necessarily universal, and many Mazda 3s have proven to be dependable with proper maintenance. Owners should be aware of these potential repair areas and budget accordingly.
