The 2010 Mazda 3 is a compact car praised for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and stylish design. It came with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 148 hp and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L inline-4 producing 167 hp and 168 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Common praises for the 2010 Mazda 3 include its engaging driving experience and value for the price. Criticisms often revolve around road noise and some interior material quality issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, especially at idle, and clunking noises from the engine bay. This can be caused by wear and tear to the rubber on the engine mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn engine mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes related to the evaporative emissions system (e.g., P0441, P0455). Rough idling and difficulty starting may also occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeably lower oil levels between oil changes, requiring frequent top-offs. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust pipe.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (Can vary significantly depending on the extent of the damage).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon cold start, rough idling, and potential loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VVT actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might resolve minor cases. In more severe cases, valve body issues or internal damage may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush; $2,000 - $4,000 for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing or swaying in the rear of the vehicle, particularly over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) light illuminated on the dashboard, even when tire pressures are within the correct range.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty TPMS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window failing to roll up or down, or moving erratically.

**Summary**

The 2010 Mazda 3, while generally a reliable car, can experience some common issues. The severity of these issues varies. Some problems, like purge valve failure or sway bar link issues, are relatively inexpensive to fix. However, problems such as excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, automatic transmission problems, or rust can be more costly. Potential buyers should have these issues in mind and carefully inspect the car, especially if it has high mileage, is located in a rust-prone area, or uses the 2.5L engine.
