**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil level warning light or noticing a significant decrease on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. Some owners have had success with different oil brands or weights. More severe cases might require engine internal inspection to check for worn piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Depending on the cause, repairs could range from a few hundred dollars (oil change and monitoring) to several thousand for internal engine work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idling or Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with rough idling or stalling, particularly when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Potential causes include issues with the mass airflow sensor, throttle body, or fuel injectors. Cleaning or replacing these components may resolve the issue. A software update to the engine control module (ECM) might also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the part requiring repair
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears. Hesitation or delays in shifting can also occur, particularly when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Start with checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement might resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body issues or solenoids within the transmission may need to be inspected and potentially replaced. Software updates to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may also be available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the severity and components needing replacement.

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rear sway bar end links, bushings, and shock absorbers. Worn or loose components should be replaced. In some cases, tightening the suspension bolts may resolve the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the component requiring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system can sometimes freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Try performing a soft reset of the infotainment system. A software update from the dealer might be available to address known bugs and improve stability. In some cases, the infotainment unit itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates may be free, but unit replacement could cost $500 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blind Spot Monitoring System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blind spot monitoring system may provide false warnings or fail to detect vehicles in the blind spot.
    *   Solution: Check the sensors located in the rear bumper for damage or obstructions. The system might need to be recalibrated by the dealer.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$400+
    *   Recalls: None Found
