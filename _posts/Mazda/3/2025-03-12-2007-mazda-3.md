The 2007 Mazda 3 is a compact car known for its sporty handling, stylish design, and affordability. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.3-liter inline-4 generating 156 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (with the 2.0L engine) or a 5-speed automatic (with the 2.3L engine). Owners often praise the Mazda 3 for its engaging driving dynamics and fuel efficiency. Common complaints include issues with rust, electrical glitches, and some reliability concerns as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potentially engine knocking in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Check the PCV valve to ensure proper crankcase ventilation. If that does not fix the issue, a mechanic may need to perform an oil consumption test to identify the root cause, potentially involving piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV valve replacement) - $1500+ (engine repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.3L Inline-4**

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially upon cold starts, indicating a problem with the VVT actuator. Can lead to decreased engine performance and fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VVT actuator and potentially the timing chain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800

    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (2.3L)**

*   **Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delay in acceleration, engine revving higher than normal without increased speed.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush, possible solenoid replacement. In severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $2500+ (rebuild or replacement)
