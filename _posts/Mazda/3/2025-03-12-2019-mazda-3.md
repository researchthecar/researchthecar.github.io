The 2019 Mazda 3 marked the beginning of the fourth generation and introduced a sleek new design and more premium features. The standard engine was a 2.5L naturally aspirated inline-4 cylinder producing 186 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque. A 2.0L engine was also available in some markets. Transmission options included a 6-speed automatic and a 6-speed manual (availability depending on trim and market). Owners often praised the car's stylish design, refined interior, and engaging driving dynamics. However, some criticisms included limited rear seat space, a somewhat firm ride, and some reported electronic gremlins.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil warning light or noticeable decrease in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: A TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) addressing this issue might exist, outlining steps for inspection and potential repair which may include piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation during acceleration, particularly from a stop or at lower speeds. Rough or jerky shifts between gears have also been noted.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) might resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission flush or replacement of solenoids within the transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect and potentially replace the rear shock absorbers or stabilizer bar bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system screen may freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot. This can affect access to navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Applying the latest software updates for the infotainment system is often the first step. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,000+ (Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or requiring frequent jump starts. This can happen even with a relatively new battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing parasitic draw (something staying on and using power when the car is off) is needed. This may involve testing individual circuits and components to identify the source of the drain. Replacing a faulty module (e.g., body control module) or addressing wiring issues can resolve the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported rattles coming from multiple areas in the vehicle, including dashboard, door panels, and rear parcel shelf.
    * Solution: The dealer must inspect and isolate the cause of the noises to repair the vehicle by tightening screws, using adhesive to secure panels, or replacing the noisy components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Mazda 3 generally receives positive reviews for its styling and driving experience. The most significant reported issues involve the infotainment system, and some instances of transmission issues, which can lead to inconvenience and potentially higher repair costs. Excessive oil consumption is also a concern for some owners of vehicles with the 2.5L engine. While many of the issues are relatively minor and fixable with software updates or minor repairs, others can be more costly and require component replacement.
