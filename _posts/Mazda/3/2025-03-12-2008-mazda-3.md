**Summary**

The 2008 Mazda 3 is a generally reliable car, but owners should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the VVT actuator on the 2.3L engine and ignition coils on the 2.0L, can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 5-speed automatic, can also lead to costly repairs. Suspension issues and rust are also common and should be inspected before purchasing a used model. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be substantial, so budgeting for potential maintenance is important.
