Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2004 Mazda 3, organized by category and drivetrain option, along with potential fixes and estimated costs.

The 2004 Mazda 3 was a popular compact car, praised for its sporty handling, attractive styling, and overall value. Two engine options were available: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.3L inline-4 generating 160 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciated the driving dynamics, some common issues arose over time. Some common complaints regarding the 2004 Mazda 3 are rust and electrical issues.

**Body**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming around the rear wheel wells, rocker panels, and door bottoms. This is a very common issue with older Mazda 3s, particularly in areas with road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust repair involves cutting out the affected metal, welding in new panels, and repainting. More minor surface rust can be treated by sanding, applying a rust converter, and painting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ per panel, depending on the severity and shop rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Failed Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, check engine light. Can lead to catalytic converter damage if left unresolved.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). Replacing all ignition coils at once is recommended since they all are the same age.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per ignition coil, plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.3L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise on startup, especially when cold. Decreased performance, rough idling, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the VVT actuator. Often involves replacing the timing chain as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (Applies to both 2.0L and 2.3L engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/ Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or delayed shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. Transmission slipping out of gear.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can help. More severe cases require transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush $100 - $200, Rebuild $1500-$3500, Replacement $2500 - $4500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate or operating intermittently. Often related to a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the window motor and/or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Central Locking System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Central locking system will randomly stop working, or will trigger the locks erratically.
    *   Solution: It's possible that the wiring harness that runs through the driver side door is damaged, and will need to be inspected, and replaced if needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $70-200
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges stop working, or work erratically. Dash lights fail.
    *   Solution: Instrument cluster will need to be replaced or professionally repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the rear suspension, especially over bumps. Uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear trailing arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visor will no longer stay in the up position. The plastic may crack.
    *   Solution: Replace the entire sun visor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$150 per visor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Mazda 3 has its share of common issues, with rust being a significant concern, especially in certain climates. Engine issues like VVT actuator failure (2.3L) and ignition coil problems (both engines) can also be costly. Electrical issues and suspension wear are typical for a vehicle of this age. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite substantial. Addressing rust promptly and staying on top of routine maintenance can help mitigate some of these issues.
