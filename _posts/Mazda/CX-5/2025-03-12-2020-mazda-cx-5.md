The 2020 Mazda CX-5 is a popular compact SUV known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. It's available with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine generating 227 horsepower (on 87 octane fuel) or 250 horsepower (on 93 octane fuel) and 310-320 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Drivers appreciate the CX-5's refined handling and comfortable ride, while some criticisms include the smaller rear seat and cargo area compared to some competitors.
