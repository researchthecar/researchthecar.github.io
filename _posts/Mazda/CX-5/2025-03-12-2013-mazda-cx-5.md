The 2013 Mazda CX-5 marked the introduction of Mazda's Skyactiv technology, emphasizing fuel efficiency and driving dynamics. Two engine options were available: a 2.0L Skyactiv-G inline-4 producing 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and later in the model year, a more powerful 2.5L Skyactiv-G inline-4 with 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual (only with the 2.0L) and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally praise the CX-5 for its sporty handling, fuel economy, and attractive styling. Common complaints often center around the base 2.0L engine lacking sufficient power, the infotainment system being dated, and some reported issues with reliability as the vehicles age.

**Summary**
The 2013 Mazda CX-5, while praised for its driving dynamics and fuel efficiency, has some common issues to consider. Engine issues, particularly oil consumption, can be costly to repair. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system are also a notable concern. Suspension and interior issues are generally less severe but can still detract from the ownership experience. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used CX-5 before purchase, paying close attention to engine oil levels and the functionality of the infotainment system. The severity of these issues is mid-range as the oil consumption is a major fix, but electrical and interior issues can be an annoyance. The costs to repair are wide ranging with a few low cost items to several high cost items.
