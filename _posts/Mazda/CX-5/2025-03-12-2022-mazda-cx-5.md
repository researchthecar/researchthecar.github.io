The 2022 Mazda CX-5 is a compact SUV known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. It comes with two engine options: a standard 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and an optional 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine delivering 227 horsepower (on 87 octane) or 256 horsepower (on 93 octane) and 310 or 320 lb-ft of torque, respectively. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the CX-5 for its sharp handling, comfortable ride, and premium feel, but some criticisms include a smaller cargo area compared to rivals and occasionally reported infotainment glitches.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke, and potential engine knocking noises if the oil level drops too low.
    *   Solution: The recommended fix involves performing an oil consumption test to determine the rate of oil loss. If the consumption is deemed excessive by Mazda standards, the repair may involve replacing piston rings or other internal engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A small number of owners have experienced premature turbocharger failure. Symptoms can include a loss of power, whistling or whining noises from the engine bay, and potentially an engine check light.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Both 6-Speed Automatic Transmissions**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifting between gears, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can manifest as jerky acceleration, noticeable hesitations, or a "clunking" sensation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the valve body might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $100 - $200, Valve body replacement: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may involve the screen going blank, the system not responding to inputs, or the navigation freezing.
    *   Solution: Often, a software update or a system reset can resolve the issue. In some cases, the infotainment unit might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $0 - $100, Infotainment unit replacement: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the backup camera image flickering, displaying a distorted image, or not working at all.
    * Solution: This can often be fixed by replacing the camera module or checking and repairing the wiring harness.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported water leaks around the sunroof, particularly during heavy rain or after a car wash.
    * Solution: This can be fixed by cleaning the sunroof drain tubes, resealing the sunroof, or replacing the sunroof weatherstripping.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area. These rattles are often more noticeable on rough road surfaces.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the source of the rattle. Dealers may attempt to isolate and eliminate the noise by adding padding or tightening loose trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Mazda CX-5 generally has a good reliability record, but some owners have reported experiencing issues with engine oil consumption, turbocharger failure, transmission smoothness, infotainment system glitches, and minor interior rattles. While the turbocharger and engine issues can be more costly to repair, many of the other reported problems are relatively minor and can be addressed with software updates or relatively inexpensive component replacements. However, the potential for more significant engine repairs should be considered when evaluating this vehicle.
