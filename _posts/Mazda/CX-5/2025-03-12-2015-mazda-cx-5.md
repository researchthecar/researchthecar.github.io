The 2015 Mazda CX-5 is a compact SUV praised for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and stylish design. Two engine options were available: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.5-liter four-cylinder generating 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a six-speed automatic transmission, although the 2.0L could also be had with a six-speed manual in the base trim. Owners often appreciate the CX-5's responsive steering, comfortable interior, and overall value. Common complaints often center on the base 2.0L engine lacking sufficient power, road noise, and the infotainment system's complexity.
