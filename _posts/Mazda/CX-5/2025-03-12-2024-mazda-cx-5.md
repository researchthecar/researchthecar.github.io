The 2024 Mazda CX-5 is a compact SUV known for its engaging driving dynamics, upscale interior, and stylish design. It's generally well-regarded for its reliability and premium feel, distinguishing it from some competitors in its class. The CX-5 offers two engine options: a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine generating 256 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque on premium fuel (or 227 hp and 310 lb-ft on regular). Both engines are paired with a smooth-shifting six-speed automatic transmission. While owners appreciate the CX-5's handling, refined interior, and overall value, some common dislikes include the smaller cargo space compared to rivals and the lack of a hybrid powertrain option.
