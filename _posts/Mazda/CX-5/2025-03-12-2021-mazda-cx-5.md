The 2021 Mazda CX-5 is a popular compact SUV known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and premium interior. It's available with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine generating 227 horsepower (on 87 octane) or 256 horsepower (on 93 octane) and 310/320 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the CX-5's handling, upscale cabin, and attractive styling. However, some common criticisms include the smaller rear seat and cargo area compared to some competitors, and the infotainment system can feel dated to some users.
