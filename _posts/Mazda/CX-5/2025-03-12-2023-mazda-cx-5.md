Okay, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2023 Mazda CX-5, categorized as requested.

The 2023 Mazda CX-5 is a compact SUV known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. Engine options include a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder generating 256 horsepower (on premium fuel) and 320 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the CX-5's handling, comfortable seats, and premium feel. Common criticisms include a smaller cargo area compared to some rivals, and the infotainment system can feel dated to some.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between regularly scheduled oil changes. This is often noticed after the vehicle has accumulated some mileage (e.g., 30,000+ miles).
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the severity. It can range from switching to a different oil type, performing an engine flush, or in more severe cases, replacing piston rings or even the engine itself. A compression test can help diagnose the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil change/flush) - $5000+ (engine replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

* **Turbo Lag/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some drivers have reported experiencing a noticeable delay or hesitation in acceleration when pressing the accelerator pedal, especially at lower engine speeds.
    * Solution: There is no official fix currently, however, some users have reported that premium fuel helps reduce the issue, while others have opted for aftermarket performance tuners that remap the ECU's throttle response.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ for aftermarket tuning solutions
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) reflash or software update can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a transmission fluid flush or replacement of faulty solenoids within the transmission may be necessary. More severe cases may require transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (TCM reflash), $100 - $250 (fluid flush), $500 - $1500+ (solenoid replacement), $3000 - $6000+ (transmission replacement).
