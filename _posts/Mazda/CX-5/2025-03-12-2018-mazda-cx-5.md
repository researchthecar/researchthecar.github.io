The 2018 Mazda CX-5 is a compact SUV praised for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and (later in the model year) a turbocharged 2.5L four-cylinder engine producing 227 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque (on 87 octane fuel, 250 hp/320 lb-ft on 93 octane). Both engines were paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the CX-5's fuel efficiency, handling, and interior quality, but some common complaints include a smaller cargo area compared to competitors and the base engine's adequate, but not thrilling, acceleration.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: The specific cause of the oil consumption can vary. Some owners have had success with switching to a different oil type or viscosity. In more severe cases, engine repairs or replacement may be necessary. A compression test should be performed to see if the rings are causing the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or delayed shifts, particularly when cold or during certain driving conditions. This can manifest as a noticeable "thunk" or hesitation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or more extensive transmission repairs might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, including the display screen, may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update is often the first step. Some owners have reported success with resetting the system. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,200+ (depending on warranty coverage and repair approach)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report instances of the AEB system activating unnecessarily, even when there are no obstacles in the vehicle's path. This can be a sudden and jarring experience.
    *   Solution: Check the sensor on the front of the vehicle for any debris. Sometimes recalibrating the AEB system can fix the issue. In some cases, the sensor needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Struts Weakening**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch struts may weaken prematurely, causing the hatch to droop or not stay open on its own. This is more common in colder climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear hatch struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling noises from various areas within the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area. The sources of these rattles can be difficult to pinpoint.
    *   Solution: This often requires investigation and tightening of loose panels or components. Felt tape or other sound-deadening materials can be used to address specific rattles.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (depending on the source and complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Creaking Seats**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced creaking sounds from the driver or passenger seats, especially during acceleration, braking, or cornering.
    *   Solution: The source of the creaking can vary, but it often involves the seat frame or mounting points. Lubricating the affected areas or tightening bolts can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, seat repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Mazda CX-5 is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some common issues. The most prevalent concerns seem to revolve around the infotainment system, excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, and occasional transmission issues. The severity and cost of these problems can vary, but addressing them promptly can help prevent further damage.
