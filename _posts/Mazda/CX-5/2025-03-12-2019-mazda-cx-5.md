The 2019 Mazda CX-5 is a compact SUV that's generally well-regarded for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. It came with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine generating 227 horsepower (on 87 octane) or 250 horsepower (on 93 octane) and 310 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the CX-5's handling and refined interior, but some criticisms include the smaller cargo area compared to competitors and the infotainment system's learning curve.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. This can lead to the engine running low on oil, potentially causing damage. Symptoms include the oil level dropping below the "low" mark on the dipstick between service intervals, and in some cases, the low oil pressure warning light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and topping off as needed. Some dealers have performed oil consumption tests to determine the severity of the issue. In more severe cases, engine replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly. Oil consumption test (if done at dealer) $100-$200. Engine replacement $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported turbocharger failure. Symptoms include a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling) from the engine, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough shifting, particularly between lower gears. Others describe hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Some have had success with transmission control module (TCM) reprogramming or software updates. In more severe cases, transmission valve body replacement or even complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: TCM reprogramming/software update: $100-$200. Valve body replacement: $800-$1500. Transmission replacement: $3,000-$5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect access to navigation, audio, and climate controls.
    *   Solution: A software update to the infotainment system may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (usually covered under warranty or a nominal fee). Infotainment unit replacement: $500-$1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera display. This can manifest as a blank screen, distorted image, or the camera not activating when the vehicle is put in reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the camera wiring and connections. If the wiring is intact, the camera unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or may stop mid-operation. This can be caused by a faulty liftgate motor, sensor issues, or problems with the hydraulic struts.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific issue (motor, sensor, struts). Replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling or squeaking noises coming from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and applying padding or tightening loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the complexity and whether it's done by a professional).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Mazda CX-5, while generally reliable, does have some reported issues. The most concerning are related to potential engine problems, particularly excessive oil consumption with the 2.5L naturally aspirated engine and turbocharger failures in the turbo engine. Transmission issues, while less severe, can still be frustrating. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and backup camera are also relatively common. Repair costs can range from minor expenses for software updates or noise isolation to significant costs for engine or transmission repairs. While not all 2019 CX-5s will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these reported issues and consider having a thorough inspection performed before purchase.
