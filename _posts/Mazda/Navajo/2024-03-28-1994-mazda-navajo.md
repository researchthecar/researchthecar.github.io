**Introduction**

The 1994 Mazda Navajo is a compact pickup truck that was jointly developed with Ford Motor Company. It came with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The standard engine was a 2.3-liter inline-4 that produced 130 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 3.0-liter V6 that produced 145 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a standard 5-speed manual transmission, while the V6 engine could also be fitted with an optional 4-speed automatic transmission.

People who own the Mazda Navajo like its affordable price, good fuel economy, and comfortable seats. However, they dislike its cramped interior, lack of power, and poor reliability.
