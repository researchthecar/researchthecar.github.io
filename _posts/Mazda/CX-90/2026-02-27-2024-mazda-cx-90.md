# 2024 Mazda CX-90

### Overview
The 2024 Mazda CX-90 represents Mazda's foray into a more premium segment, offering a range of inline-six engines and a new eight-speed automatic transmission. As a first-year model for this platform, initial reliability data is still emerging, but early indications suggest a generally robust mechanical foundation. Mazda's reputation for solid build quality appears to carry over, with most reported issues being minor or related to initial software calibration rather than fundamental design flaws. Owners generally praise the driving dynamics and upscale interior, and while long-term durability is yet to be fully assessed, the CX-90 is shaping up to be a competitive option in the three-row SUV market.
