The 2000 Mazda Protege is a compact car known for its sporty handling and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a 1.6L DOHC inline-4 producing 105 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8L DOHC inline-4 producing 122 horsepower and 120 lb-ft of torque (ES model). Both engines were available with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Protege's responsive steering and relatively low price point. Common complaints revolved around rust issues, especially in areas with harsh winters, and some reliability concerns with certain components as the car aged.

**Summary**

The 2000 Mazda Protege presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. Engine issues tend to be relatively minor (gasket leaks, IAC valve), but transmission problems, especially with the automatic, can be more costly. Suspension components like control arm bushings are typical wear items for a car of this age. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in regions with road salt. Interior issues like cracked dashboards are cosmetic but can detract from the vehicle's overall appearance. While some repairs are inexpensive, rust repair or transmission work can be costly, making a thorough inspection essential before purchasing a 2000 Protege.
