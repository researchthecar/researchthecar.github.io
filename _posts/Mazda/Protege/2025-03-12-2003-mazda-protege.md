The 2003 Mazda Protege is a compact car known for its sporty handling and reliability, offering a fun driving experience. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 130 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8L inline-4 producing 122 horsepower and 120 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. People appreciate the Protege for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and affordability. Common complaints include relatively basic interior features and potential rust issues in certain climates.

**Summary**

The 2003 Mazda Protege, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to watch out for. Engine issues like valve cover gasket leaks and MAF sensor failures are common, especially on the 2.0L engine. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic transmission, can arise from shift solenoid or mount failures. Suspension problems like broken springs and worn strut mounts are also possibilities. Rust, especially in certain climates, is a significant concern. Interior problems are less common but can occur. The severity of these issues varies, and the cost to repair can range from a few dollars for minor fixes to several hundred or even thousands for more extensive repairs like rust remediation. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect any used 2003 Protege for these potential problems.
