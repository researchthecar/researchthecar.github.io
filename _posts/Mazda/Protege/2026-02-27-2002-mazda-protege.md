### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mazda Protege is generally a dependable compact car, particularly with its smaller 1.6L engine. The more powerful 2.0L engine, while offering better performance, has a higher likelihood of experiencing issues like oil leaks and potential timing belt problems, which can be costly if the belt fails. Transmission issues, both manual clutch wear and automatic transmission problems, are also noted. Common suspension wear, electrical component failures like alternators, and the potential for rust in certain climates are other areas to monitor. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the Protege can remain a cost-effective and enjoyable vehicle.
