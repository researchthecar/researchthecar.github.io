The 2024 Mazda MX-30 EV is a compact electric crossover that blends unique styling with a focus on driving experience. It's powered by a single electric motor producing 143 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, paired with a single-speed automatic transmission. What owners tend to like about the MX-30 is its distinctive design, well-crafted interior, and engaging handling. However, its limited range (around 100 miles) is a common complaint, along with the small rear passenger space and relatively slow charging speeds.
