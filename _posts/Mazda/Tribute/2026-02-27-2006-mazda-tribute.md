### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mazda Tribute presents a mixed reliability profile. While the chassis and exterior generally hold up well, potential owners should be aware of common issues within the engine and transmission. The 2.3L and 3.0L engines can experience VVT actuator problems or intake manifold leaks, respectively. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4-speed, may develop issues with slipping or torque converter problems. Electrical components like window regulators and instrument clusters are also noted areas for potential repair. Suspension components, such as control arm bushings, can wear out over time. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Tributes can be reliable with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly.
