### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mazda Tribute presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly with the automatic transmission and potential leaks or timing chain concerns in the V6 engine. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can also wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these areas, especially as the vehicle ages. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maximizing its lifespan.
