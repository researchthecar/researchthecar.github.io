### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mazda Tribute presents a mixed reliability profile. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential owners should be aware of common issues that can arise with the engine and transmission options. The 2.3L I4 can experience oil and cooling system leaks, while the 3.0L V6 is more prone to timing chain and cooling system problems. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4-speed, may develop issues with harsh shifting or slipping. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster problems, can also occur. Proactive maintenance and addressing these known issues early can significantly improve the long-term ownership experience.
