The 2001 Mazda Tribute marked Mazda's entry into the compact SUV market. It was jointly developed with Ford, sharing the same platform and many components with the Ford Escape. The 2001 Tribute came with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing around 130 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.0L Duratec V6 engine generating approximately 200 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Tribute's sporty handling and practical cargo space, while some common dislikes included the fuel economy of the V6 engine and some reliability concerns that emerged as the vehicles aged.

**Summary**

The 2001 Mazda Tribute, while generally a reliable vehicle for its time, does suffer from some common issues as it ages. The V6 engine is prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and catalytic converter failure. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic transmission, can be costly. Suspension components are also susceptible to wear and tear. Electrical issues like power window and door lock failures are also common. Rust is a concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. Interior issues like cracked dashboards also contribute to the ownership experience. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase.
