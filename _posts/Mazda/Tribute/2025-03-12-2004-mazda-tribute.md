The 2004 Mazda Tribute is a compact SUV that offered a blend of affordability and practicality. It's generally liked for its car-like handling and relatively spacious interior. However, owners often dislike its fuel economy and somewhat dated styling compared to its competitors at the time. The available engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 130 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 200 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque.
