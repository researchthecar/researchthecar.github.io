**Summary:**

The 2003 Mazda Tribute has some common issues that range from minor to potentially severe. The 2.0L engine is known for its lack of power, while the V6 engine is more reliable but prone to timing belt failure. The automatic transmission can experience valve body problems, and the manual transmission may have shift linkage issues. Suspension components, such as ball joints and struts/shocks, may wear out over time. Electrical problems can include battery drain and headlight switch failure. The exterior is susceptible to rust, and the interior may experience power window motor or door lock actuator failures. Overall, the issues with the Tribute are relatively common and can be costly to fix.
