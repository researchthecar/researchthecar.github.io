### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Mazda Tribute presents a mixed reliability profile. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be aware of common issues within the powertrain. Both the 2.0L 4-cylinder and 3.0L V6 engines have reported instances of coolant leaks and gasket failures, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission, particularly the 4F50N, can experience slipping and torque converter problems. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also noted for wear. Electrical issues, such as failing window regulators and alternators, are not uncommon. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the Tribute to be a functional vehicle when these issues are addressed proactively.
