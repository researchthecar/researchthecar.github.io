The 2002 Mazda Tribute was a compact SUV known for its affordability and relatively sporty handling compared to its competitors. It was essentially a rebadged Ford Escape, sharing many components. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing around 130 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.0L V6 engine that put out approximately 200 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L was available with a 5-speed manual transmission, while the 3.0L was only offered with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciated its car-like driving experience, comfortable ride, and practical cargo space. Common complaints included underwhelming fuel economy, especially with the V6 engine, and some reliability issues that are typical of vehicles from this era.
