The 2008 Mazda Tribute is a compact SUV that offers practicality and affordability. Engine options include a 2.3L inline-4 producing 153 hp and 152 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 generating 200 hp and 193 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Tribute's maneuverability and fuel efficiency (especially with the I4). Common dislikes include the somewhat dated interior and the relatively unrefined driving experience compared to newer SUVs.

**Summary**

The 2008 Mazda Tribute has a mix of common issues. The engine and transmission problems, such as oil consumption and transmission slippage, can be relatively expensive to address and may indicate more serious underlying problems. Suspension and electrical issues are more common but typically less expensive to repair. Rust can be a significant concern, especially in certain climates. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and factor potential repair costs into their purchase decision. The severity of issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly.
