The 2006 Mazda Tribute is a compact SUV that was also sold as the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner. It offered a blend of practicality and affordability. The Tribute appealed to buyers seeking a capable vehicle with decent fuel economy. However, it did have some common issues. The available engine options were a 2.3L Inline-4 producing 153 hp and 152 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 200 hp and 193 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic, and a 5-speed manual that was only available with the 2.3L engine. Owners generally liked the Tribute's nimble handling and cargo space, but disliked the interior plastic quality and reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.3L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This could be indicated by blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine may be necessary. Check for leaks around the valve cover gasket and rear main seal.

*   **Check Engine Light - Evaporative Emission Control System (EVAP)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination often associated with EVAP system leaks. Symptoms can range from no noticeable drivability issues to a slight reduction in fuel economy. Error codes related to EVAP system leaks are typically present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the gas cap, purge valve, vapor canister, or leak detection pump. Smoke testing the system to pinpoint the leak is crucial for accurate diagnosis.
