The 2005 Mazda Tribute is a compact SUV that was offered with a few different engine and transmission options. The most common engine was the 3.0L Duratec V6, producing around 200 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other options included a 2.3L inline-4 engine. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Tribute for its relatively sporty handling and affordable price point. Common complaints include concerns about fuel economy and some reported reliability issues, particularly in older models.

**Engine**

**3.0L Duratec V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine runs rough, misfires, check engine light illuminates (often with lean codes), coolant loss.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Synchronizer Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud squealing or chirping noise from the engine, especially at idle. Can lead to engine stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft synchronizer (often called a cam synchronizer or cam sensor synchronizer) and potentially the camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.3L Inline-4**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil dripping from the engine, low oil level, burning oil smell. Often around the valve cover gasket or front crankshaft seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine RPMs increase noticeably during shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear, without a corresponding increase in speed. Can lead to harsh shifting or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can help. In more severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (flush) to $2000 - $4000 (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose steering and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the front lower control arm bushings or the entire lower control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Windshield Wiper Motor Failure**

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noises behind the dashboard, inability to control the temperature of the air coming from the vents (e.g., only blows hot or cold air).
    *   Solution: Replace the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (labor can be extensive as the dashboard may need to be partially disassembled).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Quarter Panels/Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the rear quarter panels and around the wheel wells. A common issue, especially in areas with harsh winters and road salt.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per panel, depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, often due to sun exposure and temperature changes.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or using a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on replacement or cover)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Mazda Tribute, while generally a decent compact SUV, has several common issues to be aware of. Engine issues, particularly with the 3.0L V6 (intake manifold leaks, camshaft synchronizer) and oil leaks in the 2.3L Inline-4, can be costly to repair. The 4-speed automatic transmission is also a potential weak point, with shift flares and slipping being common concerns. Suspension issues, electrical problems, and rust are also potential areas of concern. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand for extensive repairs. Careful inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended before purchasing a used 2005 Mazda Tribute.
