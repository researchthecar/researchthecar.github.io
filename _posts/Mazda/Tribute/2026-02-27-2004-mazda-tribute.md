### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mazda Tribute, particularly with the 2.0L engine, is generally considered a reasonably reliable vehicle. However, common issues like cooling system leaks and spark plug blowout can arise. The 3.0L V6, while offering more power, may be more prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and timing chain concerns. Automatic transmission problems, such as slipping gears and torque converter issues, are not uncommon as the vehicle ages. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument clusters, can also occur. Rust can be a concern on lower body panels. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these common issues, especially on higher-mileage examples. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to maintaining reliability.
