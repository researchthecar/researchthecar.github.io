The 2009 Mazda Tribute is a compact SUV that was also sold as the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner. It offered a practical and affordable option for families seeking a reliable vehicle. Two engine options were available: a 2.5L inline-4 producing around 171 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L Duratec V6 making approximately 240 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L was paired with a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L came standard with a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Tribute's maneuverability, fuel efficiency (especially with the 4-cylinder), and comfortable ride. Downsides mentioned include lackluster interior materials and some reported reliability concerns, especially as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may idle roughly, stall at stoplights, or hesitate during acceleration. This can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body, replacing the mass airflow sensor (MAF), or addressing vacuum leaks are common fixes. In some cases, a software update to the PCM might be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illuminated check engine light with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency. Reduced fuel economy and potential failure to pass emissions testing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duratec V6**

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, illuminated check engine light. Often, a specific cylinder misfire code (e.g., P0301 - Cylinder 1 Misfire) will be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil(s). It's often recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time, especially if the vehicle has high mileage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on how many coils are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears. The transmission may also slip, meaning the engine revs up without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush can sometimes resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, especially when accelerating at low speeds. May also exhibit a whining noise.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Broken Rear Coil Springs**

**Summary**

The 2009 Mazda Tribute, while generally reliable, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, such as ignition coil and catalytic converter failures (especially with the V6), can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting in the 6-speed automatic, can also lead to significant expenses. Suspension and electrical problems are also common. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues can vary, but it's crucial to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems before buying a used 2009 Mazda Tribute.
