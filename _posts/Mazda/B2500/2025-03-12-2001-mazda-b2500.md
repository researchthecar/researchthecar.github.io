The 2001 Mazda B2500 is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability, affordability, and fuel efficiency. The B2500 was offered with a 2.5L inline-4 engine, which produced approximately 119 horsepower and 149 lb-ft of torque. The B2500 also came with the option of a 3.0L V6 engine. Common praises for this model include its simple design, ease of maintenance, and suitability for light-duty tasks. However, it often faces criticism for its limited power, outdated interior, and susceptibility to rust, especially in regions with harsh winters.
