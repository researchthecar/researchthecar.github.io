The 2006 Mazda B2300 is a compact pickup truck, essentially a rebadged Ford Ranger, that offers a simple and reliable platform for basic utility. This model year featured a 2.3L Duratec inline-4 engine, producing around 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available were a 3.0L Vulcan V6 and a 4.0L Cologne V6, each offering increased power and towing capacity. The B2300 typically came with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine and trim.
