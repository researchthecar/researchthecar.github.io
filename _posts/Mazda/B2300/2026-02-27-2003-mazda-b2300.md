The 2.3L engine is robust but can be prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and, less commonly, spark plug blowout issues which require specialized repair. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, are typically solid. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may show wear over time, and rust can be a concern on the frame and bed in certain climates. Electrical issues are not widespread but alternator and power window regulators can fail. Interior components are generally durable, though HVAC blower motors and minor trim pieces can sometimes require attention. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing specific known issues, the B2300 can be a dependable workhorse.
