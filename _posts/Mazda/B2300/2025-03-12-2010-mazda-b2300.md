The 2010 Mazda B2300 is a compact pickup truck known for its affordability, practicality, and relatively good fuel economy for its class. It's essentially a rebadged Ford Ranger. The B2300 came standard with a 2.3-liter Duratec inline-four engine producing around 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. While owners appreciate its simple design and utility, common complaints often revolve around its basic features, less refined ride quality compared to newer trucks, and the age-related maintenance issues that come with owning a used vehicle of this era.
