The 2001 Mazda B2300 is a compact pickup truck known for its affordability and practicality. This particular model year offers a few powertrain options: a 2.3L Inline-4 engine producing around 119 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L Vulcan V6, and a 4.0L Cologne V6. The 2.3L engine was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0L engine was only offered with the 4-speed automatic. The 4.0L was only offered with the 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate its compact size, ease of parking, and fuel efficiency (particularly with the 2.3L engine). Common dislikes include its somewhat dated interior, basic features, and limited towing capacity compared to larger trucks.
