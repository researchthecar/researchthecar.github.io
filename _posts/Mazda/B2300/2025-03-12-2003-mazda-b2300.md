The 2003 Mazda B2300 is a compact pickup truck known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and reliability. It's essentially a rebadged Ford Ranger. The B2300 came standard with a 2.3L inline-4 engine producing around 135 horsepower and 153 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included a 3.0L V6 and a 4.0L V6. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level.
