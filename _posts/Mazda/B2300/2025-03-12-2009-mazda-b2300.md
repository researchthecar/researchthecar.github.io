The 2009 Mazda B2300 is a compact pickup truck, essentially a rebadged Ford Ranger. This model year offered a reliable, no-frills workhorse. Engine options included the 2.3L Duratec inline-4 engine producing around 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. While the B2300 was appreciated for its simplicity, affordability, and truck-like utility, some owners disliked the basic interior, smaller size compared to full-size trucks, and limited engine power compared to its larger counterparts.
