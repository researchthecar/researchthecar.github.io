The 2007 Mazda B2300 is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability, affordability, and fuel efficiency. It's essentially a rebadged Ford Ranger, sharing many components. The B2300 came standard with a 2.3-liter inline-four engine producing around 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. It was favored for its simple design and ease of maintenance. Some owners found the engine lacking in power for heavy hauling or towing, and the interior, while functional, was considered basic. A 3.0-liter V6 and a 4.0-liter V6 were also available, along with 5-speed manual and 5-speed automatic transmission options.
