**Introduction**

The 1990 Mazda RX-7, a legendary sports car, is renowned for its sleek styling, exceptional handling, and the distinctive rotary engine. However, like all vehicles, it has its share of issues that owners may encounter.

**Engine**

**13B Rotary Engine (255 hp, 217 lb-ft torque)**

* **Apex Seal Failure:** Apex seals create a seal between the rotors and the engine housing. Failure of these seals can lead to compression loss, reduced power, and oil consumption. Symptoms include excessive smoke from the exhaust, rough idling, and difficulty starting. Replacing the seals and resurfacing the rotor housings is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Oil Consumption:** Rotary engines naturally consume oil due to the design of the combustion chambers. Excessive oil consumption, however, can indicate worn apex seals or other engine issues. Regular oil changes and monitoring oil levels are crucial. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the severity and cause.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Grinding Gears:** Difficulty shifting gears, especially when cold, can indicate worn synchronizers or damaged gears. Replacing the faulty components is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shifting Problems:** Rough or delayed shifting, or the transmission slipping out of gear, are symptoms of transmission issues. The problem could lie in faulty solenoids, sensors, or mechanical wear. Overhauling or replacing the transmission may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Suspension**

* **Strut Bushing Failure:** Worn strut bushings compromise suspension performance, leading to clunking noises, uneven tire wear, and reduced stability. Replacing the bushings is the remedy. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Ball Joint Wear:** Worn ball joints can cause knocking sounds, clunking when turning, and excessive tire wear. Replacing the ball joints and performing an alignment is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** A faulty alternator can lead to battery discharge, dim lights, and electrical system malfunctions. Replacing the alternator is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Starter Problems:** Difficulty starting the engine can be caused by a faulty starter motor or solenoid. Replacing or repairing the starter is the remedy. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
* **ABS Sensor Issues:** Faulty ABS sensors can trigger false ABS activation, causing braking problems. Replacing the faulty sensors is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** The 1990 RX-7 is prone to rust, especially in areas like the fender arches, rocker panels, and rear hatch. Rustproofing the vehicle and addressing any rust spots promptly is crucial to prevent further damage. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the severity of rust.
* **Plastic Headlight Oxidation:** Over time, the plastic headlights can become oxidized and cloudy, reducing visibility. Polishing the headlights or replacing them with new ones is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Interior**

* **Door Panel Clips:** The plastic clips that hold the door panels in place can become brittle and break, causing the door panels to sag or rattle. Replacing the clips is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
* **Climate Control Failure:** Malfunctioning climate control systems can affect heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The problem could lie in faulty sensors, actuators, or electrical issues. Diagnosing and repairing the system is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the issue.

**Summary**

The 1990 Mazda RX-7 is a well-loved sports car, but it does have its fair share of issues. While some are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others such as engine problems and transmission failures can be more severe and costly. It is important to be aware of these potential issues before purchasing a used RX-7 and to have the vehicle regularly serviced to address any problems early on.
