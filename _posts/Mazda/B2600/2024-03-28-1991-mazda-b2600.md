**Summary:**

The 1991 Mazda B2600 is a reliable and affordable truck, but it has some common issues that can affect its performance and longevity. Engine issues, such as piston ring failure and head gasket failure, can be expensive to repair. Transmission problems, such as synchro failure and torque converter lock-up failure, can also be costly. Suspension components, such as ball joints and leaf springs, may need to be replaced periodically due to wear and tear. Electrical issues, such as alternator and ignition coil failure, can also occur. Exterior rust is a potential concern, especially in areas with heavy salt use. Some interior components, such as the dashboard and seat belt retractors, may also experience issues.
