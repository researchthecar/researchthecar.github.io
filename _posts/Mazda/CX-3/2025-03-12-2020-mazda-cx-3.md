The 2020 Mazda CX-3 is a subcompact crossover known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and well-appointed interior. It came standard with a 2.0-liter Skyactiv-G inline-4 engine producing 148 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the CX-3's nimble handling and upscale feel, but some find the rear seat space and cargo capacity to be limited. Common complaints also include a somewhat firm ride and road noise at higher speeds.

**Summary**

The 2020 Mazda CX-3 generally exhibits a mix of minor and moderate issues. While the most frequent reports involve electrical glitches (infotainment system) and some drivetrain (engine leaks, transmission shifting) concerns, the overall frequency of these issues doesn't indicate widespread major defects. The cost of repairs ranges from relatively inexpensive software updates or sensor replacements to more substantial expenses like transmission repairs or infotainment unit replacements. The potential for oil leaks and harsh shifting should be investigated before purchasing. Most repairs are estimated to be relatively inexpensive, however if the transmission needs to be repaired or replaced, this can be quite costly.
