The 2016 Mazda CX-3 is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its sporty handling, attractive styling, and upscale interior. It was only offered with one engine option: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 146 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque. This engine could be paired with either a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive or a six-speed automatic transmission with all-wheel drive. Owners generally appreciate the CX-3's fuel efficiency, nimble driving dynamics, and premium feel. However, some common criticisms include its small cargo area and tight rear seating, as well as a somewhat stiff ride.

**Engine**

**2.0L SKYACTIV-G Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil pressure light illuminating or the engine running rough due to low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and top off as needed. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic can perform an oil consumption test to determine the root cause, which might involve replacing valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3,000+ (depending on the underlying cause and repair needed. Checking for external leaks is a cheap job, while internal repairs require engine disassembly and is very costly)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibrations, especially at idle or during acceleration. A clunking noise may also be heard from the engine bay when shifting gears or going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty engine mounts. It's often recommended to replace all engine mounts at the same time to ensure even load distribution and prevent premature failure of the remaining mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the number of mounts replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**SKYACTIV-Drive 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, particularly during upshifts or downshifts. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds or when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with a transmission fluid flush and refill using the correct Mazda-specified fluid. In more severe cases, the valve body may need to be inspected and potentially replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,200+ (fluid flush is relatively inexpensive, while valve body replacement involves more labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: A bouncy or unstable ride, particularly over bumps. Visible fluid leaks around the rear shock absorbers.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the brand of shocks and labor rates)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot while driving. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Try updating the infotainment system software to the latest version. Some owners have reported success with replacing the SD card that contains the navigation data. In more severe cases, the infotainment system unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,000+ (software updates are free, SD card replacement is inexpensive, while a new unit is costly)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when parked for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Test the battery to ensure it's holding a charge. Have the electrical system checked for parasitic drains that are drawing power even when the car is off. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a malfunctioning charging system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (battery replacement is relatively inexpensive, while diagnosing and repairing parasitic drains can be more time-consuming and costly)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Daytime Running Light (DRL) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or both of the LED daytime running lights fail to illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty DRL unit. This may require removing the front bumper for access.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the complexity of the repair and parts costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors droop down or break at the hinge, making them ineffective at blocking sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per visor (depending on whether you purchase OEM or aftermarket parts and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Mazda CX-3 has some common issues, with engine oil consumption and infotainment system glitches being the most prevalent. The cost to repair these issues can vary widely, from relatively inexpensive fixes like fluid flushes to more costly repairs involving engine or transmission components. While these issues are something to be aware of, the CX-3 remains a generally reliable vehicle with a good reputation for handling and styling. Potential buyers should have a mechanic perform a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing problems and budget accordingly.
