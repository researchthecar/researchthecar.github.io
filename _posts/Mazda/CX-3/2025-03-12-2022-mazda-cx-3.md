The 2022 Mazda CX-3 is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its stylish design, nimble handling, and upscale interior. It came exclusively with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 148 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its sporty driving dynamics, fuel efficiency, and premium feel for its class. Some common dislikes include its limited rear passenger space, smaller cargo area compared to competitors, and the lack of certain advanced features as standard equipment.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (Skyactiv-G)**
* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine misfires, particularly during cold starts or under heavy acceleration. This can manifest as rough idling, hesitation, or a noticeable loss of power. The check engine light may also illuminate, with diagnostic codes indicating misfires in specific cylinders.
    * Solution: Diagnosis involves checking spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors, and compression. Replacement of faulty spark plugs or ignition coils is often necessary. In more severe cases, fuel injector cleaning or replacement, or even engine valve inspection and repair, may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have observed a higher-than-expected rate of oil consumption. They may notice a need to add oil more frequently between scheduled oil changes, with the oil level dropping below the minimum mark on the dipstick. There may or may not be visible signs of oil leaks.
    * Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is crucial. A compression test and leak-down test can help determine the cause. If worn piston rings or valve seals are suspected, engine repair or replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Skyactiv-Drive)**

* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration. The issue may be intermittent or occur more frequently under specific driving conditions.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and replacement using the specified Mazda fluid can sometimes resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection of the transmission valve body and solenoids may be necessary. In some cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the backup camera displaying a black screen, distorted image, or failing to activate at all when the vehicle is in reverse.
    * Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring for damage or loose connections. A software update may resolve the issue. If the camera itself is faulty, it will need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Inspect and tighten connections) - $500+ (Camera replacement)

    * Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle is the first step. Tightening loose screws, applying felt tape to contact points, or using foam padding can help eliminate the noise.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY) - $200+ (Professional repair)

**Summary**

The 2022 Mazda CX-3, while generally reliable, has some reported issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine misfires, oil consumption, and rough transmission shifting are notable mechanical concerns, while electrical glitches with the infotainment system and backup camera also occur.
