The 2018 Mazda 2 is a subcompact car praised for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and stylish design. However, it's not without its drawbacks. Common praises include its affordability, fun-to-drive nature, and well-appointed interior for its class. Criticisms often center around its limited rear passenger space, smaller cargo capacity, and some consider the engine underpowered for certain driving situations. The 2018 Mazda 2, at least in markets where it was available (it wasn't sold in the US market), typically came with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, producing around 108 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. This engine was usually paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission.
