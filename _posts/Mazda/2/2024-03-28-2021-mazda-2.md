**Introduction to the 2021 Mazda 2**

The 2021 Mazda 2 is a subcompact hatchback that offers a combination of style, fuel efficiency, and affordability. It is available with a single engine option, a 1.5-liter four-cylinder that produces 109 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque. The engine can be paired with either a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission. The Mazda 2 has received praise for its handling, fuel efficiency, and interior design, but has also been criticized for its lack of power and some of its interior materials.
