The 2011 Mazda 2 is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and simple design. It was only offered with a single engine option in the US: a 1.5-liter inline-4 producing 100 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque. It came with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's affordability, fuel economy, and fun-to-drive nature. Downsides often mentioned include the lack of power, limited cargo space, and basic interior features.
