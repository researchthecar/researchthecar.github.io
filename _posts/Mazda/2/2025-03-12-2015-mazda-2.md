**Summary**

The 2015 Mazda 2, while generally reliable, exhibits some common issues. Engine-related problems, such as misfires and oil consumption, can be costly to address if neglected. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, may require significant repairs. Suspension and electrical problems are less severe but can impact the driving experience. Rust on lower body panels can be a cosmetic and structural concern, especially in certain climates. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchasing. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls.
