The 2012 Mazda 2 is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and nimble handling. It was only offered with a single engine and transmission option in the US market: a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 100 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its affordability, light weight, and engaging driving dynamics for a small car. Common complaints include limited rear seat space, a basic interior, and the 4-speed automatic transmission feeling outdated compared to newer vehicles.
