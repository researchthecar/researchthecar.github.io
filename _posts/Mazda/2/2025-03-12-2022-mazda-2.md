The 2022 Mazda 2 is a subcompact car known for its stylish design, nimble handling, and fuel efficiency. In the Australian market, it is typically equipped with a 1.5-liter Skyactiv-G four-cylinder engine, producing around 81kW (109 hp) of power and 144 Nm (106 lb-ft) of torque. The engine is available with either a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise the Mazda 2 for its engaging driving experience, comfortable interior for its class, and relatively upscale feel. Some common dislikes include limited rear seat space and a somewhat basic infotainment system in lower trims.

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, check engine light illumination. Can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to pinpoint the affected cylinder. Replace the faulty spark plug, ignition coil, or fuel injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the component needing replacement and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warning light, noticeable decrease in oil level between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Inspect for oil leaks. If no leaks are present, perform an engine compression test to check for worn piston rings or valve seals. Depending on the severity, engine repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5000+ (depending on the severity of the issue and if it's an engine repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, particularly noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+ (depending on service)

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle fails to start after sitting for a short period, frequent jump starts required.
    *   Solution: Test the battery's health and replace if necessary. Check for parasitic draws by testing the current draw when the car is off. Investigate and repair any circuits causing excessive current draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Mazda 2 appears to have relatively few widespread, major issues. The most commonly reported problems relate to the engine (misfires, oil consumption), transmission (harsh shifting), infotainment system, and interior rattles. Most issues are minor, such as sensor or software bugs and can be resolved relatively inexpensively. More serious issues such as engine rebuilds can be costly. Overall, the 2022 Mazda 2 seems to be a reliable vehicle, with potential issues generally being manageable in terms of cost and severity.
