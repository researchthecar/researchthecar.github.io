The 2017 Mazda 2 is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, sporty handling, and stylish design. Available only as a hatchback in some markets, the 2017 model year typically featured a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. This engine was generally paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Mazda 2 for its engaging driving experience and affordability, but some find the rear seats cramped and the engine lacking in power for highway passing.

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a knocking or pinging sound coming from the engine, especially under load. This can be more noticeable when using lower octane fuel.
    *   Solution: Using higher octane fuel (as recommended in the owner's manual) may alleviate the issue. In severe cases, a software update or engine component inspection might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (fuel change) - $500+ (if engine work is needed)

* **Hesitation Upon Acceleration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or lag when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This can feel like the engine is slow to respond to throttle input.
    * Solution: A software update to the engine control unit (ECU) may improve throttle response. In some cases, cleaning or replacing the mass airflow sensor (MAF) sensor can also help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $300 (MAF sensor replacement)
