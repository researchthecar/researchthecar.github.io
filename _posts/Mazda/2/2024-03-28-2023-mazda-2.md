**Introduction:**

The 2023 Mazda 2 is a subcompact hatchback that offers a choice of two engine and transmission options. The naturally aspirated 1.5-liter Skyactiv-G engine generates 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque, while the optional 1.5-liter Skyactiv-G turbo engine produces 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque.
