The 2014 Mazda 2 is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and affordability. The only available engine option is a 1.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 100 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque. The 2014 Mazda 2 came with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Mazda 2's sporty feel and ease of parking, but some dislike its small size, limited cargo space, and basic interior features. Common complaints often revolve around its somewhat underpowered engine, especially when fully loaded or on steep inclines, and the outdated 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2014 Mazda 2, while generally reliable, exhibits some common issues. Engine issues, particularly related to ignition coils and oxygen sensors, can lead to performance problems and increased fuel consumption, with costs ranging from $150 to $400+. Transmission concerns with the 4-speed automatic, such as harsh shifting and slipping, may require fluid flushes or more costly repairs like valve body work or a complete transmission replacement ($150 - $3000+). Suspension issues can lead to handling problems and may require replacement of worn components ($200 - $800+ per corner). Electrical problems, such as battery drain and door lock actuator failure, can add to ownership expenses ($100-$600+). Rust can also be a concern, especially in areas with harsh winters ($100 - $1000+). While many of these issues are relatively minor and affordable to fix, potential buyers should be aware of the possibility of more significant repairs.
