The 2013 Mazda 2 is a subcompact car known for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and affordability. It was only offered with a 1.5-liter inline-4 engine producing 100 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Mazda 2 for its engaging driving experience and simple, reliable design. However, some criticisms include its basic interior, limited cargo space, and the lack of modern features compared to some competitors.
