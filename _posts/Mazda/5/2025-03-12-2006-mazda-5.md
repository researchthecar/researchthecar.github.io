The 2006 Mazda 5 is a compact multi-activity vehicle (MAV), essentially a small minivan, that offered a blend of practicality and car-like handling. All trims were offered with a 2.3-liter inline-4 engine producing 157 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque. The Mazda 5 was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission depending on the trim. Owners appreciated the 5's nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and versatile seating, while common complaints included limited cargo space with all seats in use, a somewhat noisy cabin, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.3L Inline-4 (L3-VE)**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, check engine light illumination (typically with codes P0300-P0304), reduced power, and potentially stalling. This may be caused by moisture in the spark plug wells damaging the coil pack.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s) and spark plugs. Inspect the spark plug well for moisture and address any water leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on how many coils need replacing and if a mechanic does the work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator/Sprocket Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when the engine is cold. This indicates a worn or failing VVT actuator. Can lead to poor engine performance and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the VVT actuator/sprocket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (FS4A-EL)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, slipping, especially when accelerating. Could be caused by worn-out transmission fluid, clogged transmission filter, or internal damage to the transmission (worn clutches, valve body issues).
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnostics (pressure tests, valve body inspection) are needed, potentially leading to a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (fluid/filter change), $1500 - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual (G35M-R)**
*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can also cause vague handling and premature tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn rear trailing arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the front or rear suspension when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. Worn sway bar links can compromise handling and stability.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sliding Door Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors failing to open or close properly, intermittently working, or making unusual noises. This can be due to a faulty motor, wiring issues, or a problem with the door latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the issue (wiring, motor, latch). Replace the faulty component (typically the motor).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window not moving up or down, moving slowly, or making grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting/Corrosion (Especially in Northern Climates)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the wheel wells, rocker panels, door seams, and other body panels. This is more prevalent in areas with heavy road salt use.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the affected body panels. Rust prevention treatments can help slow down the corrosion process.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the severity of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sliding Door Latch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding doors, requiring excessive force, or the latch failing to engage properly.
    *   Solution: Adjust or replace the door latch mechanism. Lubricating the latch mechanism may temporarily alleviate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2006 Mazda 5, while praised for its practicality and driving dynamics, does have some common issues. Engine problems like coil pack failure and VVT issues can be annoying and moderately expensive to fix. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic, can be more serious and costly. Suspension issues are relatively minor but can affect ride quality and handling. Electrical problems, particularly with the sliding doors, are a common nuisance. Rust is a concern, especially in colder climates. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, especially with a vehicle of this age. Pre-purchase inspections are recommended.
