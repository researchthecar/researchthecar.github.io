The 2012 Mazda 5 is a compact multi-activity vehicle (MAV), known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and family-friendly features like sliding rear doors and available seating for six. It was only offered with a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine producing 157 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners appreciate the Mazda 5's practicality and affordability, but some common complaints include the vehicle's less powerful engine, reliability issues with certain components, and a relatively basic interior compared to newer minivans.
