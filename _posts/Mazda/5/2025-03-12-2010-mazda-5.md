The 2010 Mazda 5 is a compact minivan known for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and sliding rear doors that make access easy, especially in tight parking spaces. The 2010 model came with only one engine option, a 2.3-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 153 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. The transmission options consisted of a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic, depending on the trim level. Owners generally appreciate its practicality and car-like driving experience. Common dislikes include limited cargo space compared to larger minivans, some reports of uncomfortable seats, and potential reliability concerns related to certain components.

**Engine**

**2.3L Inline-4 (L3-VE)**

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illumination (often with codes related to misfires on specific cylinders). The car may shake or lack power during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It is often recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per coil (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to VVT system malfunctions. Poor engine performance and decreased fuel economy can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VVT actuator and potentially the VVT solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates or slips when shifting gears, or shifts roughly. This can worsen over time. Check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Fluid exchange might provide temporary relief, but a transmission rebuild or replacement is often necessary. Check the condition of the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for a fluid exchange, $2500 - $4500+ for a rebuild or replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Coil Spring Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, uneven ride height, clunking or rattling noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken coil spring(s). It is usually recommended to replace both rear springs simultaneously to ensure even handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Sway Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension when driving over bumps or turning. Reduced handling stability and increased body roll during cornering.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (parts and labor) per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Sliding Door Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors may fail to open or close properly, or they may get stuck. This can be due to a faulty motor, sensor, or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific cause (motor, sensor, wiring) and replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (parts and labor), depending on the part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard, difficulty starting the engine, or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Replace the failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the rear wheel arches. This is more common in areas with harsh winters and road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, involving sanding, patching, and repainting. Prevention can be improved with rust proofing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (parts and labor) per side, depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Latch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The center console latch breaks preventing the center console compartment from staying closed.
    * Solution: Replace the broken latch with a new latch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50 for the part itself, can be replaced yourself without labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Mazda 5 presents a mix of potential issues. Engine-related problems such as ignition coil failures and VVT actuator issues, transmission slippage, and suspension concerns like broken coil springs can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues with the power sliding doors and alternator failure are also notable. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be more severe and expensive to address. Addressing rust proactively and staying on top of maintenance can mitigate some of these risks.
