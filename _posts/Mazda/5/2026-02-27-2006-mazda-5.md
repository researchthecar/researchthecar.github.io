### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mazda 5 presents a mixed reliability picture. While the manual transmission is generally robust, the automatic transmission can experience issues with harsh shifting. Engine-wise, the 2.3L unit is prone to VVT actuator problems and oil leaks from the valve cover gasket. Suspension components like control arm bushings and rear shocks may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, particularly with power windows and the HVAC blower resistor, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, the Mazda 5 can be a practical choice, but potential buyers should factor in the possibility of addressing these common issues to maintain its reliability.
