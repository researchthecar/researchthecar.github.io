The 2013 Mazda 5 is a compact minivan known for its nimble handling and fuel efficiency, making it a popular choice for families needing practicality without sacrificing driving enjoyment. It's powered by a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine producing 157 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission (though the manual is less common). Owners generally appreciate its sliding rear doors for easy access in tight parking spaces, its relatively small footprint, and decent fuel economy. Downsides often cited include its somewhat dated interior, limited cargo space compared to larger minivans, and a basic feature set in lower trims.
