The 2009 Mazda 5 is a compact minivan known for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and practical sliding rear doors. The 2009 Mazda 5 was only available with one engine option, a 2.3-liter inline-4 (L3-VE) producing 153 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Two transmission options were available: a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Mazda 5's car-like driving experience and its ability to comfortably carry six passengers. Common dislikes include its somewhat underpowered engine, limited cargo space with all seats in use, and some reported reliability issues.
