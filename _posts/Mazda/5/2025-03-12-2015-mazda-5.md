The 2015 Mazda 5 is a compact multi-activity vehicle (MAV), offering a blend of minivan practicality and car-like driving dynamics. It came with a single engine option: a 2.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 157 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission, though the manual was only available on the base Sport trim and is far less common. People generally appreciate the Mazda 5 for its maneuverability, relatively good fuel economy for its class, and sliding rear doors, which make access in tight parking spaces much easier. However, some common complaints include its somewhat dated interior, limited cargo space compared to larger minivans, and occasionally lackluster performance, especially when fully loaded.

**Summary**

The 2015 Mazda 5 has a mix of potential issues. Some, like oil leaks and TPMS sensor failures, are relatively common and inexpensive to address. Others, such as power sliding door malfunctions or harsh shifting in the automatic transmission, can be more costly to diagnose and repair. While the Mazda 5 is generally a reliable vehicle, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have a mechanic inspect the vehicle before purchasing. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially impacting the vehicle's drivability and safety, with repair costs varying widely depending on the specific problem.
