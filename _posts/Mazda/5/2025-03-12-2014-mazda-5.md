The 2014 Mazda 5 is a compact multi-activity vehicle (MAV), offering a blend of minivan practicality and car-like handling. It was only available with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 157 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission (though the manual was much less common). Owners appreciate its sliding rear doors, fuel efficiency, and nimble handling, but some dislike its somewhat dated interior, limited cargo space compared to larger minivans, and basic features in lower trims.

**Summary**

The 2014 Mazda 5 has some common issues, with the potential for engine oil leaks and transmission problems being among the more concerning and potentially expensive. Electrical problems with the sliding doors and battery drain issues can also be frustrating. While suspension and air conditioning issues are also noted, they tend to be less widespread than the previously listed problems. Potential buyers should carefully inspect used Mazda 5s for these common issues and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly, so being proactive is key.
