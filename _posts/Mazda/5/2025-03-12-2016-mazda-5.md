The 2016 Mazda 5 is a compact minivan appreciated for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and relatively affordable price point. All 2016 Mazda 5's came with a single engine option, the 2.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine. This engine produces 157 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Common praises for the Mazda 5 include its easy maneuverability in city environments and its practicality for small families needing more space than a sedan. Common complaints often revolve around its relatively basic interior, limited cargo space compared to larger minivans, and engine performance that can feel strained when fully loaded.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as needing to add a quart of oil every 1,000-2,000 miles.
    *   Solution: Regularly check the oil level and top off as needed. For severe cases, a mechanic can perform a leak-down test to determine if there are internal engine issues such as worn piston rings or valve seals causing the oil consumption. Depending on the root cause, repairs can range from replacing valve seals to a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for minor top-offs) to $2,000 - $5,000+ (for engine rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or delayed shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear or when downshifting. Transmission slippage, where the engine revs without a corresponding increase in speed, can also occur.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or appears dark/burnt, a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may resolve the issue. For more severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 (fluid flush and filter) to $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can be prone to sagging, especially when the vehicle is frequently loaded with passengers or cargo. This can result in a bouncy ride and reduced ground clearance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers or coil springs can restore the ride height and improve the ride quality. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs can help prevent future sagging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (depending on parts replaced and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sliding Door Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors can sometimes fail to open or close properly, or may exhibit erratic behavior. This can be due to issues with the door motor, latch mechanism, or wiring harness.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the issue may involve checking the fuses, inspecting the wiring harness for damage, and testing the door motor and latch mechanism. Replacing the faulty component will typically resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the component that needs to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the sunroof area, particularly during heavy rain. This can cause water stains on the headliner and potentially damage electrical components.
    *   Solution: Check the sunroof drain tubes for clogs and clear them if necessary. Resealing the sunroof assembly may also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the severity of the leak and the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower portions of the sliding doors.
    *   Solution: Removal of the rust, application of body filler if needed, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Mazda 5, while a practical and fuel-efficient option in the compact minivan segment, does have some potential issues to be aware of. Engine issues such as excessive oil consumption can be a concern, while transmission issues like harsh shifting could lead to more significant repairs. The sagging rear suspension and electrical issues with the sliding doors are also common complaints. The sunroof leak and rust can be moderate depending on the region the vehicle is in. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more costly repairs, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2016 Mazda 5.
