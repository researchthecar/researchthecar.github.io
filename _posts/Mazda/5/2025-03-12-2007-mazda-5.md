The 2007 Mazda 5 is a compact multi-activity vehicle (MAV), known for its surprising practicality and car-like handling. It was only available with a 2.3-liter inline-4 engine producing 153 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Mazda 5 for its fuel efficiency, sliding rear doors (making access to the rear seats easier), and its relatively nimble driving experience. Common dislikes include the dated interior, limited cargo space with all seats in use, and the relatively short lifespan of some components.
