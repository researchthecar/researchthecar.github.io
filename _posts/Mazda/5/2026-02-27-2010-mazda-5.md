### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mazda 5 is a generally dependable vehicle with a good track record for reliability. The powertrain (engine and transmission) options are robust and rarely present significant issues beyond normal wear. The most commonly reported technical concerns tend to be related to suspension components like control arm bushings, electrical gremlins such as BCM malfunctions or alternator failures, and some exterior rust issues in specific areas. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor resistor can also fail. Despite these potential issues, they are not widespread enough to deter most buyers, and addressing them typically falls within reasonable repair costs for a vehicle of this age.
