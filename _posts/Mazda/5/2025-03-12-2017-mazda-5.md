The 2017 Mazda 5 is a compact multi-activity vehicle (MAV), also known as a minivan, offering practicality and nimble handling. It was only offered with a 2.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 157 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission, though the manual was much less common. Owners generally appreciate the Mazda 5's maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and flexible seating, but some dislike its relatively small size compared to larger minivans and its somewhat dated interior compared to newer models.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon cold start, especially from the front of the engine. Can lead to eventual timing chain failure and engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner with an updated part. In severe cases, the timing chain and guides may also need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant leak from Water Pump**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak from the front of the engine. Overheating can result from this leak.
    * Solution: Replace the water pump and coolant.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay or harshness during gear changes, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear or during downshifts. May be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and refill with the correct type of fluid. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be required, including checking for valve body issues or worn solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $800 - $2,500+ (valve body or solenoid repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**
*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing or swaying in the rear, particularly over bumps. Reduced handling and stability. Visible oil leaks from the shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers. Consider replacing both sides simultaneously for even performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sliding Door Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power sliding doors may fail to open or close properly. Can be intermittent or consistent. Potential causes include a faulty door motor, wiring harness issues, or a malfunctioning control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause of the malfunction. This may involve testing the motor, checking the wiring harness for breaks or shorts, or replacing the control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the part needing replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The bottom of the sliding door begins to rust due to water and debris accumulating in the seams.
    *   Solution: Sand the rust off and repaint it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents. Possible causes include a faulty blower motor, a blown fuse, or a defective blower motor resistor.
    *   Solution: Check the fuse first. If the fuse is good, test the blower motor resistor and blower motor. Replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 (fuse or resistor), $200 - $400 (blower motor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Mazda 5 is generally a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the reported issues. The most concerning are the timing chain tensioner issue, which can lead to severe engine damage and the sliding door malfunctions, both which can incur significant repair costs. Suspension issues and HVAC problems are also common. Addressing these issues proactively can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and extend its lifespan.
