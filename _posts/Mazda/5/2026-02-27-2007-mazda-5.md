### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mazda 5 is a practical vehicle with a generally decent reliability record, but it is not without its potential issues. Owners should be aware of common problems such as VVT actuator failures and oil leaks in the engine, potential transmission fluid leaks, and worn suspension components like control arm bushings and rear shocks. Electrical issues, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, can also arise. Exterior rust, especially in harsher climates, and interior wear on the driver's seat are also points to consider. While many of these issues are repairable, they represent potential costs for owners. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate these reliability concerns.
