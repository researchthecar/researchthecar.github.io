The 2004 Mazda Miata, also known as the NB Miata, is a beloved two-seat roadster celebrated for its agile handling, simple mechanics, and fun driving experience. The sole engine option for the 2004 model year is the 1.8L DOHC inline-4 engine, producing approximately 142 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual (available on certain trims), and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Miata's responsive steering, balanced chassis, and the joy of open-top motoring. Conversely, some common complaints include limited storage space, a small cabin, and susceptibility to rust, especially in areas where salt is used on roads during winter.

Addressing these common problems can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for more extensive work.
