### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mazda Miata is a generally reliable sports car with a strong mechanical foundation. The 1.8L engine is robust, though age-related oil and coolant leaks are the most common non-wear-and-tear issues. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, are typically very durable. Suspension components are also well-regarded. Electrical gremlins, particularly with wiring harness corrosion and power window motors, can arise due to the car's age. Exterior issues often center on the soft top's condition and the pop-up headlight mechanisms. Interior wear, especially on the driver's seat bolster, is common but cosmetic. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing these specific potential issues, the 2002 Miata remains a rewarding and dependable vehicle.
