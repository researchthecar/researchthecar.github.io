### Overview
The 2004 Mazda Miata, also known as the NB generation's final model year, is generally regarded as a reliable and fun-to-drive sports car. It benefits from a mature platform and Mazda's reputation for building durable vehicles. While no car is entirely free of potential issues, the Miata typically avoids widespread, costly problems. Owners often praise its engaging driving dynamics and relatively straightforward mechanicals. Common areas to inspect, as with any used vehicle, include the typical wear items, but significant systemic failures are uncommon for well-maintained examples of this model year.
