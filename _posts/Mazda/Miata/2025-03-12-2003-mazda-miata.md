The 2003 Mazda Miata, part of the NB generation (1999-2005), is a beloved roadster known for its nimble handling, simple design, and engaging driving experience. This model year came with a 1.8L inline-4 engine producing approximately 142 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Miata for its affordability, reliability, and the joy of open-top motoring. Criticisms generally revolve around its small size, limited cargo space, and relatively basic features compared to modern cars.

**Summary**

The 2003 Mazda Miata is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it is prone to certain issues. Engine oil leaks and soft top problems are relatively common. Suspension components, particularly bushings and springs, can wear out over time. Transmission issues, especially synchro wear in the manual transmissions, can also occur. Electrical problems, such as power window failures, are also possible. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, from minor repairs costing under $100 to more extensive repairs requiring hundreds or thousands of dollars. Careful inspection and maintenance can help prevent or mitigate many of these issues.
