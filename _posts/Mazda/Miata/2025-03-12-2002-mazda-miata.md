The 2002 Mazda Miata, also known as the NB generation, is a beloved roadster known for its agile handling, lightweight design, and fun driving experience. All 2002 Miatas came equipped with a 1.8L DOHC inline-4 engine producing 142 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual (available on some models), and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Miata's simplicity, reliability, and affordability, but common complaints revolve around its small size, limited cargo space, and relatively basic features.

Engine issues like valve cover gasket leaks are relatively inexpensive to fix, while transmission problems, especially with the automatic, can be more costly. Suspension issues like broken coil springs are also common due to the age of the vehicles. Electrical issues are relatively minor and inexpensive. Soft top wear is expected given the age and design. Overall, while some issues require attention, they are generally manageable and don't detract significantly from the car's inherent appeal.
