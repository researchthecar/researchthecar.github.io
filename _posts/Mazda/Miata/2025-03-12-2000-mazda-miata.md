**Summary**

The 2000 Mazda Miata is generally a reliable car, but like any vehicle of its age, it's prone to certain issues. The most common problems relate to leaks (valve cover, coolant, convertible top), worn suspension components, and synchro wear in the manual transmissions. Electrical issues are less frequent but can occur. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the issue and whether you do the work yourself or take it to a professional. The overall severity of these issues is moderate, with most being repairable without excessive expense. However, neglecting these issues can lead to more significant problems down the road.
