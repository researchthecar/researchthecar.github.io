The 2008 Mazda RX-8 is a unique sports car known for its high-revving rotary engine and balanced handling. It came equipped with a 1.3-liter RENESIS rotary engine producing either 232 horsepower (high-power version with 6-speed manual) or 212 horsepower (low-power version with 4-speed automatic). Torque was approximately 159 lb-ft for the high-power and 152 lb-ft for the low-power. People appreciate the RX-8 for its distinctive engine sound, engaging driving experience, and relatively affordable price point. Common dislikes include poor fuel economy, high oil consumption, and the rotary engine's inherent reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**1.3L RENESIS Rotary (High-Power, 6-Speed Manual)**

*   **Low Compression/Hot Start Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting when the engine is hot, often requiring multiple attempts or special starting procedures. This is a common symptom of low compression due to rotor seal wear.
    *   Solution: Compression test to verify, potential engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption is inherent to the rotary engine design. However, some RX-8s experience significantly higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels closely. Possible causes include worn oil control rings or metering oil pump issues. Addressing requires engine teardown.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the severity and components needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to incomplete combustion (a characteristic of rotary engines), catalytic converters in RX-8s can fail prematurely. Symptoms include a check engine light (often P0420), reduced performance, and a sulfur smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.3L RENESIS Rotary (Low-Power, 4-Speed Automatic)**

*   **Low Compression/Hot Start Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as the high-power engine: Difficulty starting when hot, requiring multiple attempts. Indication of failing rotor seals and low compression.
    *   Solution: Compression test to verify, potential engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption is inherent to the rotary engine design. However, some RX-8s experience significantly higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels closely. Possible causes include worn oil control rings or metering oil pump issues. Addressing requires engine teardown.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the severity and components needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to incomplete combustion (a characteristic of rotary engines), catalytic converters in RX-8s can fail prematurely. Symptoms include a check engine light (often P0420), reduced performance, and a sulfur smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin AI 6-Speed Manual**

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly 2nd or 3rd, especially when cold. Indicates worn synchronizers.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Aisin AI 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay when shifting gears, accompanied by harsh engagement. Can be caused by low fluid, worn valve body components, or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change, valve body repair/replacement, or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the shocks and struts, causing a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased body roll.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shocks and struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+ (depending on brand and installation)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idle, reduced power, and check engine light. Rotary engines are particularly sensitive to ignition coil condition.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coils and spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ESS (Electric Steering Support) Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illumination of the ESS warning light on the instrument panel. Can be indicative of a malfunction with the power steering system
    *   Solution: Diagnoses via scan tool and resolve the steering issue
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Side Marker Light Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation buildup inside the side marker lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the side marker lights or resealing the existing ones.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sun visors that droop down and do not stay in the upright position.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2008 Mazda RX-8, while a unique and enjoyable sports car, is plagued by reliability issues, primarily concerning its rotary engine. Low compression and hot start issues are prevalent, and oil consumption is a constant concern. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, engine rebuilds or replacements can be very costly. The automatic transmission can experience shifting problems, and electrical issues like ignition coil failure are also common. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential expenses and maintenance requirements before purchasing.
