The 2005 Mazda RX-8 is a unique sports car known for its distinctive rotary engine and engaging handling. It came equipped with a 1.3-liter RENESIS rotary engine, offered in two states of tune: a 197 horsepower version for the automatic transmission and a 232 horsepower version for the manual transmission. Torque was around 156 lb-ft for the manual and 159 lb-ft for the automatic. People appreciate the RX-8 for its balanced chassis, rev-happy engine, and distinctive styling. However, the rotary engine's high maintenance requirements, oil consumption, and potential for flooding are significant drawbacks.

**Engine**

**1.3L RENESIS Rotary (High Power - Manual Transmission Model)**

* **Low Compression/Hot Start Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: A common issue is low compression in the rotary engine, leading to difficult or impossible hot starts. This often manifests as the engine cranking for an extended period without firing, especially after being warmed up. Loss of power and poor fuel economy can also be symptoms.
    * Solution: A compression test confirms the issue. Rebuilding or replacing the engine is typically required. A "hot start fix" can be attempted but is usually a temporary solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rotary engines inherently consume oil as part of their lubrication process. However, excessive oil consumption can be a sign of internal wear, particularly rotor seals. This can lead to fouled spark plugs, catalytic converter damage, and premature engine failure.
    * Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is crucial. Replacing the oil control rings and other worn internal components during an engine rebuild can address excessive consumption.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ as part of a rebuild.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Spark Plug Fouling**
    * Description/Symptoms: The RX-8's rotary engine can be prone to spark plug fouling, especially if the engine is not revved high enough regularly or if the oil metering system is malfunctioning. Misfires, rough idling, and loss of power are common symptoms.
    * Solution: Regularly inspect and replace spark plugs. Using the correct type of spark plugs is critical. Address any issues with the oil metering pump or system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for spark plug replacement. Oil metering system repairs can vary significantly.
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.3L RENESIS Rotary (Low Power - Automatic Transmission Model)**

* **Low Compression/Hot Start Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the high-power version, low compression is a common issue, leading to difficult or impossible hot starts.
    * Solution: Rebuild or engine replacement is generally necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption is a common issue.
    * Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is required. Oil control ring replacement/rebuild is recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ as part of a rebuild.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Spark Plug Fouling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the high-power version, spark plug fouling can cause misfires and poor performance.
    * Solution: Replace spark plugs regularly. Ensure the oil metering system is functioning correctly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for spark plug replacement. Oil metering system repairs can vary.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Synchro Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Grinding when shifting into certain gears, particularly 2nd or 3rd. Difficulty engaging gears.
    * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. Replacing worn synchros.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially over bumps. Vague handling and poor steering response.
    * Solution: Replacing worn bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the bushings replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Failed Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll.
    * Solution: Replacing worn struts and/or shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Coil Pack Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, check engine light. This is especially crucial to rotary engines.
    * Solution: Replace the coil packs. Consider upgrading to aftermarket units for improved reliability.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the brand and quantity of coil packs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **ESS Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The eccentric shaft sensor (ESS), can fail, leading to difficulty starting, stalling, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the ESS sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rear Taillight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the taillight housings.
    * Solution: Replacing the taillight housings or attempting to reseal them.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sun Visor Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sun visors that won't stay in the upright position.
    * Solution: Replacing the sun visors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per visor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Mazda RX-8 presents a unique ownership experience, primarily due to its rotary engine. While it offers sporty handling and a distinctive design, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to engine compression, oil consumption, and coil pack failures. Repair costs can be significant, especially for engine rebuilds or replacements. Suspension and electrical issues are also common, but generally less costly to address than engine-related problems. Regular maintenance and careful monitoring of engine health are crucial for RX-8 ownership.
