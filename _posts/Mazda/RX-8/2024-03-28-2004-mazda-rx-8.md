## 2004 Mazda RX-8

The 2004 Mazda RX-8 is a sports car that slots above the MX-5 Miata in the brand's lineup. Mazda offered the RX-8 in five different trims: Base, Touring, GT, Shinka, and 40th Anniversary Edition. The RX-8 came with only one powertrain; a 1.3-liter naturally aspirated rotary engine mated to a six-speed manual transmission. The engine produced 238 horsepower and 159 lb-ft of torque.

The RX-8 is praised for its handling, performance, and unique styling. However, it is also known for its poor fuel economy and potential engine issues.
