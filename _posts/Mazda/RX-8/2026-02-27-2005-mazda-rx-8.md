### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mazda RX-8's primary reliability concern revolves around its unique 1.3L Renesis rotary engine. Apex seal wear and eccentric shaft bearing failure are the most significant potential issues, often leading to costly engine rebuilds. Proper maintenance, including regular oil checks and avoiding prolonged idling or low-RPM operation, is crucial. Ignition system components can also require attention. The manual transmission is generally robust but can develop synchronizer issues, while the automatic is less prone to major problems. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior are generally considered reliable with no widespread common failures reported.
