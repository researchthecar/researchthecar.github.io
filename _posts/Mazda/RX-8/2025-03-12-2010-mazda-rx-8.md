The 2010 Mazda RX-8 is a unique sports car known for its high-revving rotary engine and engaging handling. It's powered by a 1.3-liter RENESIS rotary engine, producing 232 horsepower and 159 lb-ft of torque in the high-power version (manual transmission) and 212 horsepower and 159 lb-ft of torque in the low-power version (automatic transmission). Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the RX-8 for its balanced chassis, sharp steering, and distinctive engine note. However, the rotary engine's unique characteristics also lead to its most common criticisms: high oil consumption, relatively poor fuel economy, and potential for premature engine wear if not properly maintained. The car's quirky styling and limited practicality are also sometimes cited as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**1.3L RENESIS Rotary Engine (High-Power, Manual Transmission)**

*   **Low Compression/Difficult Starting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rotary engine is known to lose compression over time, especially if not properly maintained. Symptoms include hard starting when hot or cold, rough idle, decreased power, and increased oil consumption. A compression test specific to rotary engines can confirm this issue.
    *   Solution: A rebuild or replacement of the engine is the only solution. Some owners opt for an engine swap with a different engine entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the rotary engine's design, unburnt fuel can enter the catalytic converter, leading to overheating and eventual failure. Symptoms include a check engine light, rattling noises from under the car, and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. Address any underlying engine issues contributing to unburnt fuel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Metering Pump (OMP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The OMP injects oil directly into the combustion chamber to lubricate the apex seals. Failure of the OMP can lead to inadequate lubrication, causing premature engine wear and potential engine failure. Symptoms include excessive oil consumption, a check engine light, and engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the OMP. Some owners pre-mix oil directly into the fuel as a preventative measure, though this can be inconvenient.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.3L RENESIS Rotary Engine (Low-Power, Automatic Transmission)**

*   **Low Compression/Difficult Starting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as high-power version. The rotary engine is known to lose compression over time, especially if not properly maintained. Symptoms include hard starting when hot or cold, rough idle, decreased power, and increased oil consumption. A compression test specific to rotary engines can confirm this issue.
    *   Solution: A rebuild or replacement of the engine is the only solution. Some owners opt for an engine swap with a different engine entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as high-power version. Due to the rotary engine's design, unburnt fuel can enter the catalytic converter, leading to overheating and eventual failure. Symptoms include a check engine light, rattling noises from under the car, and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. Address any underlying engine issues contributing to unburnt fuel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Metering Pump (OMP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as high-power version. The OMP injects oil directly into the combustion chamber to lubricate the apex seals. Failure of the OMP can lead to inadequate lubrication, causing premature engine wear and potential engine failure. Symptoms include excessive oil consumption, a check engine light, and engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the OMP. Some owners pre-mix oil directly into the fuel as a preventative measure, though this can be inconvenient.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Synchro Wear/Grinding Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The synchronizers, particularly in 2nd gear, can wear prematurely, leading to grinding when shifting, especially at higher RPMs.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding the transmission with new synchronizers or replacing the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic can exhibit harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear. Slipping between gears may also occur, especially under heavy load.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and fluid change may temporarily alleviate the problem. However, a rebuild or replacement of the transmission is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The RX-8's ignition system is known to be sensitive, and coil packs can fail prematurely, leading to misfires, rough running, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed coil packs. It's recommended to replace all four coil packs at the same time. Upgrading to aftermarket coil packs is also a common practice.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Side Marker Light Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The side marker lights, especially the front ones, are prone to bulb failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the bulb.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $50
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2010 Mazda RX-8, while a fun and unique sports car, is known for its potential engine issues, mainly related to the RENESIS rotary engine. The most concerning and costly issues revolve around engine compression loss, catalytic converter failure, and oil metering pump malfunctions. The transmission can also exhibit issues, especially the manual transmission. The electrical system, particularly the coil packs, are susceptible to failure. While not all RX-8s will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget accordingly for potential repairs. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major engine failures, with repair costs potentially ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
