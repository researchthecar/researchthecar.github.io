The 2009 Mazda RX-8 is a unique sports car known for its high-revving rotary engine and balanced handling. It came equipped with a 1.3L Renesis rotary engine, offered in two different power outputs depending on the trim level and transmission: 232 horsepower for models with the 6-speed manual transmission and 212 horsepower for models with the 4-speed automatic. The RX-8 is praised for its distinctive styling, engaging driving experience, and relatively affordable price point. However, it is also criticized for its poor fuel economy, high oil consumption, and the inherent unreliability of the rotary engine.

**Engine**

**1.3L Renesis Rotary (232 hp, 6-speed manual)**

*   **Low Compression/Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A very common issue for all RX-8's is low compression caused by rotor housing or apex seal wear, leading to difficulty starting, rough idling, poor performance, and eventually, engine failure. The rotary engine design makes it particularly susceptible to wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Flooding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rotary engines can be prone to flooding, especially during short trips or frequent start/stop driving. This happens when excess fuel enters the combustion chamber and prevents the engine from starting.
    *   Solution: Deflooding procedure (holding the accelerator pedal down while cranking) or replacement of spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.3L Renesis Rotary (212 hp, 4-speed automatic)**

*   **Low Compression/Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the manual transmission version, low compression due to rotor housing and/or apex seal wear is a common issue leading to starting problems, rough running, and eventual engine failure.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Flooding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rotary engines can be prone to flooding, especially during short trips or frequent start/stop driving. This happens when excess fuel enters the combustion chamber and prevents the engine from starting.
    *   Solution: Deflooding procedure (holding the accelerator pedal down while cranking) or replacement of spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic transmission version is more prone to catalytic converter failure due to richer fuel mixtures and lower exhaust temperatures. Symptoms include a check engine light, reduced performance, and a sulfur smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly 2nd and 3rd, due to worn synchros.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front strut mounts are prone to wear and tear, leading to clunking noises, especially over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rotary engines are sensitive to ignition system health. Coil failure can cause misfires, rough running, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the ignition coils and spark plugs. Upgraded ignition coils are recommended
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ESS (Electric Steering System) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power steering assist, warning light illumination, or steering wheel becoming hard to turn.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of the power steering components (motor, module, etc.)
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can form on the rear trailing arm and cause excessive damage leading to failure.
    *   Solution: Complete replacement of the trailing arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors are known to sag or break at the hinge.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Mazda RX-8, while fun to drive, has significant reliability concerns centered around its rotary engine. Low compression and the potential for engine failure are the most significant and costly issues, impacting the long-term ownership experience. Other issues, such as ignition coil problems, synchro wear, and electrical issues, contribute to the overall cost of ownership and require diligent maintenance. While some of the non-engine related problems are not extremely expensive, the potential for an engine rebuild makes it a vehicle to approach with caution.
