**Introduction to the 2005 Mazda RX-8**

The 2005 Mazda RX-8 is a high-performance sports car that is unique in that it uses a rotary engine rather than a traditional piston engine. The rotary engine is known for its compact size and low weight, which contributes to the RX-8's excellent handling and acceleration. The RX-8 is available with two engine options: a 1.3-liter rotary engine that produces 232 horsepower and 159 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3-liter rotary engine that produces 250 horsepower and 159 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a six-speed manual transmission.

**Engine**

**1.3-liter Rotary Engine (232 horsepower)**

* **Excessive oil consumption:** The 1.3-liter rotary engine has a tendency to consume excessive amounts of oil, which can lead to engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms may include blue smoke coming from the exhaust, a decrease in oil levels on the dipstick, and a rough idle. The solution is to have the engine rebuilt or replaced. Estimated cost to fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
* **Apex seal failure:** Apex seals are small, triangular seals that form the combustion chamber in a rotary engine. They can fail over time, causing a loss of compression and a decrease in power. Symptoms may include a rough idle, a loss of power, and an increase in fuel consumption. The solution is to replace the apex seals. Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $3,000

**1.3-liter Rotary Engine (250 horsepower)**

* **Excessive oil consumption:** Similar to the 232 horsepower engine, the 250 horsepower engine can also suffer from excessive oil consumption. The symptoms and solutions are the same as described above.
* **Ignition coil failure:** The ignition coils are responsible for providing the spark that ignites the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber. They can fail over time, causing a misfire and a decrease in power. Symptoms may include a rough idle, a loss of power, and an increase in fuel consumption. The solution is to replace the ignition coils. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $600

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Transmission fluid leak:** The six-speed manual transmission can develop a leak in the transmission fluid housing. This can lead to a decrease in transmission fluid levels and eventually result in transmission damage if not addressed. Symptoms may include a decrease in shifting performance, a whining noise coming from the transmission, or a visible leak under the car. The solution is to replace the transmission fluid housing. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $1,500
* **Synchronizer failure:** The synchronizers in the transmission are responsible for matching the speed of the gears before they mesh, which allows for smooth shifting. They can wear out over time, causing difficulty shifting gears or a grinding noise. The solution is to replace the synchronizers. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $2,000

**Suspension**

* **Rear suspension noise:** The rear suspension of the RX-8 can develop a noise that is often described as a clunking or rattling sound. This noise is typically caused by worn or damaged suspension components, such as the control arms, ball joints, or sway bar links. The solution is to inspect the rear suspension and replace any worn or damaged components. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator is responsible for charging the battery and providing power to the electrical systems in the car. It can fail over time, causing the battery to discharge and the electrical systems to malfunction. Symptoms may include a dead battery, a lack of power, or a warning light on the dashboard. The solution is to replace the alternator. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $700
* **Starter failure:** The starter is responsible for starting the engine. It can fail over time, causing the engine to be unable to start. Symptoms may include a clicking noise when trying to start the engine, or the engine may not crank at all. The solution is to replace the starter. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof seal leak:** The sunroof seal can leak over time, allowing water to enter the cabin of the car. This can lead to water damage to the interior and the development of mold. The solution is to replace the sunroof seal. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $700
* **Door lock actuator failure:** The door lock actuators are responsible for locking and unlocking the doors. They can fail over time, causing the doors to become inoperable. Symptoms may include a lack of response from the door lock buttons, or the doors may not lock or unlock properly. The solution is to replace the door lock actuators. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400

**Interior**

* **Dash trim rattle:** The dash trim can develop a rattle over time, which can be annoying to passengers. The solution is to tighten or replace the trim. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200
* **Climate control panel failure:** The climate control panel can fail over time, causing the climate control system to malfunction. Symptoms may include a lack of response from the climate control buttons, or the climate control system may not work properly. The solution is to replace the climate control panel. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $700

**Summary**

The 2005 Mazda RX-8 is a unique and high-performance sports car that is known for its excellent handling and acceleration. However, it does have some potential issues that can be expensive to fix. The most common problems include excessive oil consumption, apex seal failure, ignition coil failure, transmission fluid leaks, synchronizer failure, rear suspension noise, alternator failure, starter failure, sunroof seal leaks, door lock actuator failure, dash trim rattles, and climate control panel failures. While these issues can be severe and expensive to fix, they are not necessarily common. With proper maintenance and care, the RX-8 can be a reliable and enjoyable car to own.
