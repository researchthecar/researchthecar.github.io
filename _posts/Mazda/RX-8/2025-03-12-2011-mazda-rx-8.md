The 2011 Mazda RX-8 is a unique sports car known for its high-revving rotary engine and balanced handling. It was offered in one engine configuration, the 1.3L RENESIS rotary engine producing either 232 horsepower in the higher output version or 212 horsepower in the standard version. The engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The RX-8 is praised for its engaging driving experience, distinctive styling, and relatively affordable price point. However, it's also criticized for its rotary engine's maintenance requirements, oil consumption, and fuel economy. Potential buyers should be aware of the specific issues that plague the RX-8 to be more informed.

**Engine**

**1.3L RENESIS Rotary Engine**

*   **Low Compression/Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common and well-known issue with the RX-8's rotary engine is the rapid wear of the apex seals, leading to loss of compression, difficulty starting (especially when warm), poor performance, and eventual engine failure. Symptoms include long cranking times, hesitation during acceleration, and a noticeable drop in power.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding or replacing the engine is the only permanent solution. A compression test is crucial for assessing the engine's health before purchase.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the scope of the rebuild or replacement engine)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rotary engine inherently consumes oil as part of its lubrication process. However, excessive oil consumption is a common complaint. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently (sometimes every few hundred miles), blue smoke from the exhaust, and fouled spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed is necessary. Using a higher viscosity oil can sometimes help. If consumption is excessive, it could indicate internal engine wear requiring a rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: If the problem is extreme, $3,000 - $8,000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Flooding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rotary engines are prone to flooding, especially during short trips or repeated start attempts without allowing the engine to fully warm up. Flooding occurs when excess fuel enters the combustion chambers, preventing the engine from starting.
    *   Solution: There are specific de-flooding procedures outlined in the owner's manual (holding the accelerator pedal fully depressed while cranking). Prevention involves ensuring the engine reaches operating temperature during each drive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Can typically be resolved without cost through de-flooding procedures. If persistent, spark plug replacement might be needed ($100-$300).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with synchro wear, particularly in 2nd gear. This manifests as difficulty shifting into gear, grinding noises, or popping out of gear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected synchros or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper/Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the shocks and struts can wear out, leading to a bouncy ride, reduced handling performance, and increased body roll.
    *   Solution: Replacing the shocks and struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on brand and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The RX-8 is known to have issues with the ignition coils failing, which can cause misfires, rough running, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the ignition coils and spark plugs. It is often recommended to replace all coils and plugs at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors can sag over time, becoming loose and failing to stay in the desired position.
    *   Solution: Replacing the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Mazda RX-8 offers a unique driving experience, but potential owners should be aware of the potential maintenance costs associated with its rotary engine. The most significant concern is the potential for engine failure due to apex seal wear, which can be costly to repair. Oil consumption and coil pack failures are also common issues. While some suspension and interior issues may arise, the engine remains the primary area of concern and potential expense. The severity of the issues range from minor inconveniences (sun visor sagging) to major repairs (engine rebuild). The potential cost of these repairs should be factored into the purchase price.
