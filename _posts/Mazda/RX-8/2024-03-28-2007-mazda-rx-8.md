**Introduction:**

The 2007 Mazda RX-8 is a sporty coupe known for its unique rotary engine. It was offered with a manual or automatic transmission. With its 232-horsepower engine and agile handling, the RX-8 provides an exhilarating driving experience. However, it is also notorious for several common problems.

**Engine**

**1.3L Renesis Rotary Engine**

- **Excessive Oil Consumption:** The rotary engine is prone to burning excessive amounts of oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. The problem worsens as the engine ages.
- **Ignition Coil Issues:** The ignition coils can fail prematurely, resulting in misfires, reduced power, and difficulty starting.
- **Apex Seal Failure:** The apex seals are critical components that seal the combustion chambers. They can wear prematurely, leading to reduced compression, loss of power, and eventually engine failure.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Aisin AW6A-EL)**

- **Slipping Gears:** The transmission may slip gears under load, resulting in rough shifting and loss of power. It can also cause damage to the transmission.
- **TCM Issues:** The transmission control module (TCM) can malfunction, leading to incorrect shift patterns, gear hunting, and other transmission problems.

**Suspension**

- **Front Control Arm Bushings:** The front control arm bushings tend to wear prematurely, resulting in clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
- **Rear Subframe Cracking:** On later model years, the rear subframe can crack near the differential mounts, leading to a loss of handling and potential safety concerns.

**Electrical**

- **Starter Issues:** The starter motor can wear prematurely, leading to difficulty starting or complete failure.
- **Battery Drain:** The electrical system can experience battery drain, leading to a dead battery even when the vehicle is parked.
- **Dashboard Lighting Issues:** The dashboard lighting can malfunction, causing bulbs to burn out or illumination to be dim or intermittent.

**Exterior**

- **Clearcoat Peeling:** The clearcoat on the paint can peel or fade, especially on early model years.
- **Rust:** The RX-8 is prone to rust in areas such as the undercarriage, fenders, and around the windshield.

**Interior**

- **Center Console Rattling:** The center console can rattle or vibrate, especially at higher speeds.
- **Heater Core Leak:** The heater core can leak coolant, causing a sweet smell in the cabin and potential overheating issues.
- **A/C Condenser Failure:** The A/C condenser can fail prematurely, resulting in decreased cooling performance.

**Summary:**

The 2007 Mazda RX-8 is a fun and sporty car but plagued by a variety of issues. Engine and transmission problems are common, and the suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior can also experience problems. The severity and cost of repairs vary depending on the specific issue. However, owners should be prepared for potential expenses associated with these problems.
