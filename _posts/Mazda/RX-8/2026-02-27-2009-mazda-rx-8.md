### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mazda RX-8 is a car for enthusiasts who understand its unique nature. The primary concern revolves around the rotary engine, which demands meticulous maintenance, including regular oil checks and a specific warm-up/cool-down procedure, to mitigate issues like apex seal wear and oil consumption. Failure to do so can lead to costly rebuilds. The manual transmission has also seen reports of clutch wear and synchronizer problems. While other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior are generally less problematic, specific electrical components like ignition coils and power window motors can fail. Prospective buyers should factor in the potential for higher maintenance costs and the specialized knowledge required to keep the rotary engine healthy.
