# 2006 Mazda RX-8

### Overview
The 2006 Mazda RX-8, a unique sports car renowned for its rotary engine and distinctive styling, presents a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. While its performance and handling are highly praised, certain mechanical components, particularly the rotary engine, require diligent maintenance and can be prone to specific issues if not properly cared for. Owners often report a learning curve associated with the unique engine design. The RX-8's enthusiast following often means that many vehicles have been well-maintained, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific needs of the rotary powertrain. Other systems, such as the transmission and electrical components, generally fare better, though some isolated incidents are noted.
