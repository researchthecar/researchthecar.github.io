The 2006 Mazda RX-8 is a unique sports car known for its high-revving rotary engine and balanced handling. It came equipped with a 1.3-liter RENESIS rotary engine, producing either 212 horsepower or 232 horsepower depending on the trim and transmission option. It was offered with either a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many enthusiasts appreciate the RX-8 for its distinctive design, engaging driving experience, and relatively affordable price point. However, the rotary engine's unique design also contributes to some common reliability concerns, including low compression, oil consumption, and difficulty starting when hot. Potential owners should be aware of these issues and factor them into their purchasing decisions.

**Engine**

**1.3L RENESIS Rotary Engine (High Power - 232 hp)**

*   **Low Compression/Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rotary engines are known for apex seal wear, which leads to low compression, difficulty starting (especially when hot), poor performance, and eventually engine failure. Symptoms include extended cranking, a weak-sounding engine during cranking, and decreased power output.
    *   Solution: A compression test specific to rotary engines is required to diagnose. If compression is low, an engine rebuild or replacement is necessary. Prevention through proper maintenance (frequent oil changes and proper warm-up procedures) can help extend engine life.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ (Engine rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the rotary engine's oil consumption, the catalytic converter can become clogged and fail. This leads to a loss of power, poor fuel economy, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. Addressing the underlying oil consumption issue is also crucial to prevent repeat failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Flooding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rotary engines are prone to flooding, particularly after short trips or failed starts. This occurs when excess fuel enters the engine and prevents it from starting.
    *   Solution: A deflooding procedure, such as holding the accelerator pedal to the floor while cranking, can sometimes clear the flooding. In some cases, removing the spark plugs and manually clearing the fuel is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Mostly DIY fixes but can result in a tow if the car is stuck and unable to start.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.3L RENESIS Rotary Engine (Standard Power - 212 hp)**

*   **Low Compression/Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the high-power version, apex seal wear leads to low compression, difficulty starting, poor performance, and eventual engine failure.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild or replacement. Proper maintenance is vital.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil consumption clogs and destroys the catalytic converter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter and addressing the oil consumption issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Flooding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rotary engines are prone to flooding, particularly after short trips or failed starts.
    *   Solution: A deflooding procedure
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Mostly DIY fixes but can result in a tow if the car is stuck and unable to start.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Premature Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch wears out prematurely, causing slippage, difficulty shifting, and eventual failure.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rubber bushings in the suspension components (control arms, sway bar links, etc.) wear out, causing clunking noises, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings or complete suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the components needing replacement and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Weak Starter Motor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The starter motor can become weak over time, leading to difficulty starting the engine, especially when hot. This is exacerbated by the engine's already challenging starting characteristics.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the starter motor with an updated, higher-torque unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ESS (Emergency Start System) Issues (If equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ESS could malfunction and not allow the vehicle to start, or to run longer than intended
    *   Solution: Replacement of the starter motor with an updated, higher-torque unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: 06V075000, 06V417000

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion of the rear suspension trailing arm.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear suspension trailing arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: 17V077000

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors tend to sag and no longer stay in the upright position.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sun visor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Mazda RX-8 presents a unique ownership experience due to its rotary engine. The most severe and costly issues revolve around the engine, particularly low compression and potential engine failure due to apex seal wear. Catalytic converter failure is also a common problem linked to the engine's oil consumption. Other issues, such as suspension bushing wear, weak starter motors, and sun visor sagging, are less severe but can contribute to overall maintenance costs. While some of these issues can be mitigated with diligent maintenance, potential buyers should be aware of the potential for significant repair expenses associated with the rotary engine.
