### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mazda RX-8 is a niche sports car with a unique rotary engine that demands specific maintenance. While the chassis and most mechanical components are generally reliable, the engine's apex seals and oil consumption are known potential weak points requiring vigilance and potentially costly repairs. Transmission reliability is decent, though clutch wear is expected. Electrical gremlins like window motors and ignition coils can occur. Interior wear, particularly on seats and the center console, is common for a car of this age and performance focus. Prospective owners must be prepared for the specialized care the rotary engine requires.
