The 2007 Mazda RX-8 is a unique sports car known for its distinctive rotary engine and balanced handling. It came equipped with a 1.3-liter RENESIS rotary engine, offered in two power outputs depending on the trim level. The standard trim produced around 212 horsepower and 159 lb-ft of torque, while the higher-performance trim delivered approximately 232 horsepower and 159 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (standard trim), a 6-speed manual (high-performance trim), and a 4-speed automatic transmission. The RX-8's strengths lie in its engaging driving dynamics, relatively affordable price point, and distinctive styling. However, the rotary engine's inherent quirks, including its high oil consumption and potential for apex seal failure, are common concerns for owners. Fuel economy and limited practicality are also frequently cited as downsides.

**Engine**

**1.3L RENESIS Rotary Engine**

*   **Apex Seal Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of compression, difficulty starting, rough idling, reduced power, and eventual engine failure. This is the most notorious issue with the RX-8's rotary engine.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild or replacement is required. This involves replacing the apex seals, side seals, corner seals, and other worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Low Compression**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, poor idle, lack of power, and decreased fuel economy. This often precedes apex seal failure.
    *   Solution: Compression test to diagnose. If compression is low, an engine rebuild or replacement is generally the only viable option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **High Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rotary engine inherently consumes oil as part of its lubrication process. However, excessive oil consumption (more than 1 quart per 1,000 miles) is a common complaint. Can lead to catalytic converter failure.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels frequently and top off as needed. Using high-quality synthetic oil designed for rotary engines can sometimes help. In severe cases, an engine rebuild might be necessary to address internal wear. Some owners pre-mix oil into their fuel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $5,000+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Flooding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the engine, especially when warm. Caused by excessive fuel entering the combustion chambers.
    *   Solution: "Deflooding" the engine by holding the accelerator pedal to the floor while cranking. Some owners install a stronger starter motor to aid in starting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $500+ (for a stronger starter)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, poor fuel economy, check engine light (P0420 code). Often caused by excessive oil consumption or misfires.
    *   Solution: Catalytic converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission (High Performance Trim)**

*   **Clutch Master Cylinder Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting, soft or spongy clutch pedal, inability to engage gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch master cylinder and possibly the slave cylinder.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, leaking fluid from the shocks/struts.
    * Solution: Replacement of shocks/struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Weak Starter Motor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slow cranking, difficulty starting the engine, especially when warm. The original starter motor is often insufficient for the rotary engine's needs.
    *   Solution: Upgrading to a higher-torque starter motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coils Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, loss of power, check engine light. The rotary engine is sensitive to weak ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replacing the ignition coils and spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sun visors no longer stay in the up position or the plastic hinge breaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sun visor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Mazda RX-8, while a unique and engaging sports car, is plagued by potential issues, primarily revolving around its rotary engine. Apex seal failure and high oil consumption are the most significant concerns, often leading to expensive repairs or engine replacement. Electrical and suspension components can also require attention. The severity and cost of these issues range from relatively minor (sun visors) to extremely expensive (engine rebuild). Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their ownership costs. Regular maintenance, proper oil selection, and proactive monitoring are crucial for maximizing the RX-8's longevity.
