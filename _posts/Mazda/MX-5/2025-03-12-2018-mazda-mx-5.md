**Summary**

The 2018 Mazda MX-5 Miata is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some common issues. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption, can be costly if repairs are needed. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also fairly common annoyances. Convertible top leaks and seat adjustment failures round out the list of common issues.
