The 2008 Mazda MX-5 Miata is a beloved roadster known for its nimble handling, engaging driving experience, and affordability. It is powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 166 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque when equipped with the 6-speed manual transmission, and 158 horsepower when equipped with the 6-speed automatic. Some owners appreciate the car's simplicity, open-top experience, and reliability, while others find the interior cramped, the ride harsh, and the trunk space limited. Common complaints revolve around its small size and susceptibility to rust.

**Engine**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating and noticeable blue smoke from the exhaust upon startup or acceleration.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels closely and use the recommended oil type and viscosity. If consumption is excessive, a compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the cause. Potential fixes range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the camshaft actuator. It is part of the Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system, and when it starts failing it can cause the engine to run rough, have reduced power, and trigger a check engine light. Error codes can include P0011, P0012, P0016 or P0017.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Camshaft Actuator or the entire VVT system.
