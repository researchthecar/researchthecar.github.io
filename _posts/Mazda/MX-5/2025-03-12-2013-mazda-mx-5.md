The 2013 Mazda MX-5 Miata is a beloved roadster known for its nimble handling, engaging driving experience, and affordability. Powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 167 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque (158 hp in models with the automatic transmission), it was available with either a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Miata's light weight, responsive steering, and open-top enjoyment. However, some common complaints revolve around its small size, limited storage space, and relatively basic interior.
