The 2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata marked the beginning of the ND generation, known for its return to a smaller, lighter design reminiscent of earlier Miatas. It's celebrated for its agile handling, engaging driving experience, and open-top fun. However, like any car, it has its share of potential problems. The 2015 MX-5 was available with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 155 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Common praises include its fun-to-drive nature and affordability, while criticisms often mention limited storage space and a somewhat noisy cabin.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Bay Wiring Harness Rubbing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The main engine harness that runs from the ECU can rub through on a support bracket in the engine bay. This chafing can expose wires causing issues such as short circuits, intermittent stalling, or failure to start.
    *   Solution: Inspect the wiring harness for signs of wear. If damage is found, repair or replace the damaged wires. Preventative measures include re-routing the harness or adding protective shielding to prevent future rubbing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether DIY or professional repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Fuel Injector**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more of the fuel injectors fail causing misfires, rough idle, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per injector (depending on labor and parts costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Grinding Between 2nd and 3rd Gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a grinding noise when shifting from 2nd to 3rd gear, especially when the transmission is cold. This can indicate a problem with the synchronizers.
    *   Solution: Replacing the synchronizers for 2nd and 3rd gear can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2500+ (depending on the extent of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds. This could be due to a software issue or mechanical problems within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission control module (TCM) software update. If the problem persists, a transmission fluid change or valve body replacement might be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the solution).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced a parasitic battery drain, leading to a dead battery, especially if the car sits for an extended period.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the drain by testing individual circuits. Possible culprits include aftermarket accessories, the security system, or a faulty module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the convertible top, particularly near the windows or seals, are a common complaint.
    *   Solution: Inspect and adjust the convertible top latching mechanisms. Replace worn or damaged seals. Apply a sealant to problem areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the severity and whether DIY or professional repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system can experience freezing, crashing, or slow response times.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. Ensure the software is up-to-date. In some cases, replacing the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $800+ (replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata is a fun and reliable sports car, but it's not without its potential issues. Owners may encounter problems with the engine wiring harness, fuel injectors, transmission (especially grinding in the manual), battery drain, convertible top leaks, and the infotainment system. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, with some being relatively inexpensive to fix, while others require more extensive repairs.
