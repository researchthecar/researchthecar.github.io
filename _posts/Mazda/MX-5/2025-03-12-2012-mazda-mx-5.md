The 2012 Mazda MX-5 Miata is a popular two-seat roadster known for its agile handling, engaging driving experience, and classic sports car appeal. All 2012 MX-5s came with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 167 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque when equipped with the 6-speed manual transmission (158 hp with the automatic). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally praise the MX-5 for its affordability, fun-to-drive nature, and reliability, however, some common complaints revolve around its small size, limited cargo space, and road noise.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon cold start, especially noticeable at the front of the engine. This is typically due to the timing chain tensioner failing to maintain proper tension on the timing chain.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, guides, and potentially the timing chain itself if stretched.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil dripping from the engine, often near the valve cover gasket or front main seal. Visible oil buildup can be seen on the engine block.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket, front main seal, or other leaking seals as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the source of the leak.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding noise when shifting into a specific gear, particularly 2nd or 3rd, especially when cold. Difficulty engaging the gear smoothly.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn synchro rings and potentially other related components such as gears.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether a rebuild or replacement is performed.

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, valve body issues may be present and require further inspection and repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the complexity of the issue.

**Suspension**

*   **Damper/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and poor handling. Visible leaks from the shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shock absorbers/dampers. It's recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ for parts and labor, depending on the brand of shocks.

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window operates slowly or not at all. Clicking noise from the door when the window switch is activated.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

*   **Taillight Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more taillights not functioning properly, or malfunctioning due to corrosion.

**Summary**

The 2012 Mazda MX-5 Miata is generally a reliable vehicle, but like all cars, it has some common issues. Engine issues can range from minor oil leaks to more serious timing chain problems, with repair costs varying accordingly. Transmission issues, especially with the 6-speed manual, can be costly due to synchro wear. Suspension problems, particularly with worn shocks, are relatively common and can affect handling. Electrical and exterior issues, such as power window motor failure and convertible top leaks, can also occur. Interior issues like seat foam degradation can impact comfort. Overall, while some issues can be expensive to address, careful inspection and preventative maintenance can help mitigate these problems and ensure a long-lasting and enjoyable ownership experience.
