The 2011 Mazda MX-5 Miata is a two-seat roadster known for its engaging driving experience, balanced handling, and relatively affordable price point. The 2011 model year comes standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 167 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque when paired with the 6-speed manual transmission (158 hp and 140 lb-ft with the automatic). Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, and a 6-speed automatic. Owners typically praise the MX-5 for its fun factor, nimble cornering, and simple, reliable design. Common complaints often revolve around limited storage space, a relatively noisy cabin, and a somewhat firm ride, particularly for longer journeys.

**Summary**

The 2011 Mazda MX-5 is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it has its share of common issues. The most concerning problems tend to revolve around the transmission, particularly synchro wear on the 6-speed manual, which can be costly to repair. Engine issues such as valve lifter tick and purge valve failure are also present but generally less severe. Suspension wear is typical for a car of this age. Most other issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for transmission issues and thoroughly inspect the car, especially the convertible top, before purchasing. Addressing minor electrical or interior issues is generally not a major concern.
