The 2011 Mazda 6 is a mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling and stylish design. This model year offered three engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 170 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L V6 producing 272 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L Inline-4 engine. The 2.5L engine was typically paired with a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission (availability varied by trim), while the 3.5L V6 came exclusively with a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Mazda 6 for its responsive steering and comfortable ride. Common complaints include issues with interior trim quality and some electrical glitches.
