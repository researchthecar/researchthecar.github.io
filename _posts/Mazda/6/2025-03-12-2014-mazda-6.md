The 2014 Mazda 6 marked a significant redesign for the model, showcasing Mazda's "KODO - Soul of Motion" design language. This model year offered two engine options: a 2.5-liter Skyactiv-G inline-4 engine producing 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.2-liter Skyactiv-D diesel engine (though the diesel engine was not widely available in the US market). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally praised the 2014 Mazda 6 for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, stylish design, and comfortable interior. Common complaints centered around the infotainment system, road noise, and some concerns regarding long-term reliability.
