The 2013 Mazda 6 marked a significant redesign, offering a more stylish and fuel-efficient mid-size sedan. The base engine was a 2.5-liter inline-4 cylinder producing 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. The 2013 model year only came with an inline 4 cylinder, though in later years a V6 would be offered. This engine was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praised the car's sharp handling, fuel economy, and attractive design. Criticisms often centered on road noise and some of the interior materials.
