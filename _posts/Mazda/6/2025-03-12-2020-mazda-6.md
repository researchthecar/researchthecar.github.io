The 2020 Mazda 6 is a mid-size sedan known for its sleek design, engaging driving dynamics, and premium interior. It offers two engine options: a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-4 generating 227 horsepower (on 87 octane fuel) or 250 horsepower (on 93 octane fuel) and 310 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Mazda 6 is praised for its refined handling, comfortable ride, and upscale features. Some common criticisms include the somewhat limited rear seat space compared to rivals and the infotainment system's learning curve.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**2.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual noises (whining, screeching) from the engine bay, check engine light illuminated. Some owners have reported complete turbocharger failure at relatively low mileage.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. It is important to diagnose the root cause of the failure (oil starvation, etc.) to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or during downshifts. Hesitation or delay in engaging a gear after coming to a stop. Some owners have reported the issue worsening over time.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush may provide a temporary improvement. In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can address the issue. Severe cases may require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush $200-$400, TCM update is usually free, valve body replacement $800 - $1500, Transmission Rebuild $3000+
*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A vibration or shudder felt at highway speeds when the torque converter locks up.
    *   Solution: Some have found that using a specific transmission fluid such as Castrol Transmax Multi-Vehicle ATF has helped. Replacing the Torque Converter will usually be the recommended solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash and reboot unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealership is the primary fix. In more severe cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Free Software Update, Replacement Unit $800-$1500+
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, particularly if the vehicle is not driven frequently or if it is only driven for short distances. The vehicle may fail to start.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic drains (accessories left on, faulty modules). Replacing the battery with an upgraded AGM battery may help. Ensuring the battery is properly charged is important, especially in colder climates.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: New Battery $150-$400, Diagnostic test for parasitic drains $100-$200+

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear deck. These noises are often more pronounced on rough road surfaces.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and applying felt tape or other sound-dampening material to secure loose components. Dealership service departments may be able to address this under warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Ranging from DIY fixes with minimal cost to potentially several hundred dollars at a dealership depending on the source and complexity.
*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, make noise, or not open/close.
    *   Solution: Dealer inspection to determine if the sunroof needs to be reset or the motor needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Reset Free, Motor Replacement $500-$1000+

**Summary**

The 2020 Mazda 6, while generally reliable, has some reported issues. The most concerning are the potential for turbocharger failure on the turbocharged models and transmission issues in both engine configurations. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also reported, while interior rattles and sunroofs can be annoying. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major repairs. The cost to fix these issues can vary widely, with some repairs potentially costing several thousand dollars. It's wise to thoroughly inspect any used 2020 Mazda 6 and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems.
