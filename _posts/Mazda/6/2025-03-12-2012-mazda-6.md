The 2012 Mazda 6 is a mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling and sleek design. Engine options include a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 170 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.7-liter V6 generating 272 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.5L also offered a 6-speed manual.
