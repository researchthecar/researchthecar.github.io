### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mazda 6 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly with the V6 engine and manual transmission. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil consumption and VVT problems with the 2.5L engine, and occasional transmission harshness with the automatic gearbox. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and alternator failures are also documented. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior climate control actuators may require attention. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate these potential reliability concerns and ensure a positive ownership experience.
