### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mazda 6 is a reasonably reliable vehicle, particularly if equipped with the 2.3L engine. While it doesn't suffer from catastrophic common failures, potential buyers should be aware of possible oil leaks and VVT actuator issues on the 2.3L, and intake manifold/coolant leaks on the 3.0L V6. Automatic transmission issues like harsh shifting can occur and may require significant repair. Manual transmissions are generally more robust, though clutch wear is a normal maintenance item. Suspension components like bushings and links can wear out, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, are not uncommon. Rust can be a concern in certain climates, especially around wheel arches. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly, the 2006 Mazda 6 can be a dependable choice.
