The 2015 Mazda 6 is a mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and stylish design. It was praised for its engaging driving experience, upscale interior, and value for money. However, some owners have reported certain issues. The 2015 Mazda 6 offered two engine options: a 2.5L Skyactiv-G inline-4 producing 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque and a diesel 2.2L Skyactiv-D (which was never released in the US Market due to issues with emissions). Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Common complaints include the infotainment system, some electronic glitches, and occasional reports of engine or transmission issues. People liked the car's sleek styling and fuel economy, and handling, but disliked the road noise and sometimes the infotainment system interface.

**Engine**

**2.5L Skyactiv-G Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke (though rare), and the need to frequently top off the oil.
    *   Solution: In some cases, dealerships have performed oil consumption tests and, if deemed excessive, replaced the piston rings or even the entire engine. However, this is not a widespread issue and often depends on driving habits and maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (if engine replacement is necessary)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Direct Injection Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: As a direct-injection engine, the Skyactiv-G is susceptible to carbon buildup on the intake valves, leading to rough idling, misfires, reduced performance, and decreased fuel economy over time.
    *   Solution: Regular cleaning of the intake valves through methods like walnut blasting or chemical induction cleaning can resolve this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Skyactiv-Drive)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can manifest as jerky acceleration or hesitation when shifting.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. Fluid changes are also important.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (for software update or fluid change); $1,500 - $4,000+ (for transmission repair or replacement if the issue is more severe)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot. This affects the navigation, audio, and climate control interfaces (when controlled through the screen).
    *   Solution: Software updates from Mazda can sometimes address these issues. In some cases, replacing the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update); $500 - $1500+ (for infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors can fail, causing false warnings or inaccurate readings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty TPMS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per sensor (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling noises coming from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard or door panels.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and applying felt tape or other sound-deadening materials to the affected area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the severity and whether professional help is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the sunroof would get stuck or make excessive creaking noises when operating.
    *   Solution: Inspecting the sunroof tracks and greasing the moving parts. In other cases, the sunroof motor would need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (for cleaning and greasing); $200 - $700+ (for motor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Mazda 6 is a generally reliable vehicle, but some common issues include infotainment system glitches, potential excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, and occasional transmission issues with the 6-speed automatic. The severity and cost of these issues can vary. Infotainment and interior rattles are generally less severe and costly to fix. However, engine or transmission problems can be more expensive to address. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchasing. Getting a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic is recommended.
