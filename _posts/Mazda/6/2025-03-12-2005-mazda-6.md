Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic for the 2.3L engine, and a 5-speed automatic for the 3.0L V6. Owners often praised the Mazda 6 for its fun-to-drive character and attractive aesthetics, while common complaints revolved around issues with rust, electrical problems, and some engine/transmission quirks.
