The 2017 Mazda 6 is a mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling, upscale interior, and fuel efficiency. The standard engine is a 2.5L naturally aspirated inline-4 cylinder producing 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Mazda 6 for its driving dynamics, attractive styling, and value for money. Criticisms often include a slightly smaller rear seat compared to competitors and the infotainment system not being as intuitive as some others.

**Engine**

**2.5L Skyactiv-G Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. This is more common in higher mileage vehicles. Symptoms include low oil level warning light and potentially engine knocking if oil levels are critically low.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is crucial. If consumption is excessive, a dealer or qualified mechanic should perform an oil consumption test. Potential fixes range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, depending on the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity and repair needed
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The purge valve, responsible for venting fuel vapors from the fuel tank into the engine, can fail. Symptoms include a check engine light (typically P0441, P0455, or P0456 codes), rough idling, difficulty starting, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Skyactiv-Drive 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifts, particularly when cold or at lower speeds. Hesitation when accelerating or shifting between gears has also been noted.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush using the correct Mazda fluid is often recommended as a first step. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal wear may require further diagnosis and repair or replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500 (fluid flush), $1000 - $4000+ (valve body/transmission repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The torque converter is a fluid coupling which allows the engine to spin somewhat independently of the transmission. Torque converters are known to fail. Symptoms can include shuddering while at speed, the vehicle stalling when at a stop, or the vehicle not moving at all when put in gear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter, which requires removal of the transmission. It is usually recommended to replace the transmission filter and fluid when replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system can sometimes freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot. This affects navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Applying the latest software updates from Mazda is often the first step. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Investigate for parasitic draws by a mechanic. Ensure proper battery maintenance and consider a battery tender if the vehicle is not used regularly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (battery replacement), $100+ (diagnostics for parasitic draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted surface rust on the vehicle's undercarriage, particularly in regions that experience harsh winters with road salt.
    *   Solution: Undercoating or rust proofing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing from Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have complained of rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard, particularly on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating and securing the source of the rattle, which may involve tightening screws, adding padding, or replacing loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the complexity and time required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Mazda 6 is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some issues. Engine problems like excessive oil consumption can lead to costly repairs, while transmission issues such as harsh shifting may require fluid changes or more extensive work. Electrical problems like infotainment issues can be irritating. However, most of these issues are not widespread.
