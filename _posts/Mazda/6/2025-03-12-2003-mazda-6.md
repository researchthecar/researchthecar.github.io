The 2003 Mazda 6 marked Mazda's return to the mid-size sedan market. It was lauded for its sporty handling, stylish design, and fun-to-drive nature, differentiating it from more appliance-like competitors. Owners often appreciated its engaging driving dynamics, responsive steering, and overall value. However, some common complaints included premature rust, some reliability concerns, and interior component quality. The 2003 Mazda 6 came with three engine options: a 2.3L inline-4 producing 160 hp and 155 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L V6 producing 220 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L inline-4 that was offered outside of the US market. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic (for the 2.3L I4 and 3.0L V6), and a 4-speed automatic (exclusively for the 2.0L I4 outside the US).

**Summary**
The 2003 Mazda 6, while praised for its sporty driving experience and styling, does have its share of common problems. Engine issues, particularly with the 2.3L I4's timing chain and the 3.0L V6's oil leaks, are relatively frequent and can be costly to address. Transmission problems, especially slipping or harsh shifting in the automatic, also require attention. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in regions with road salt usage. Suspension issues, specifically with the rear control arm bushings, can impact handling and tire wear. Overall, while the Mazda 6 offers a fun driving experience, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing. The severity of these issues range from minor inconveniences (sun visor sagging) to major repairs (transmission rebuild), and costs can vary significantly depending on the extent of the damage.
