The 2019 Mazda 6 is a mid-size sedan known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. It offers two engine choices: a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine generating 227 horsepower (250 hp with 93 octane fuel) and 310 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Mazda 6 for its sporty handling, attractive interior, and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include a slightly smaller rear seat compared to some competitors and a somewhat dated infotainment system.

    * Solution: Checking the battery's health and replacing it if necessary is the first step. Some owners have also found that disconnecting aftermarket accessories or ensuring all interior lights are off can help prevent battery drain. A parasitic draw test can also be performed to diagnose the cause.
