The 2004 Mazda 6 was a popular mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling and stylish design. Available engine options included a 2.3L inline-4 engine producing around 160 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L V6 engine producing around 220 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, 5-speed automatic (for the I4 and V6), and a 6-speed manual (for the V6). Owners generally appreciated the Mazda 6's driving dynamics and aesthetics, but common complaints centered around rust, particularly in areas with harsh winters, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2004 Mazda 6 is a generally reliable vehicle, but rust is a significant concern, particularly in regions with salted roads. Engine issues like timing chain tensioner failure (2.3L) and ignition coil failure (3.0L) can occur, and the automatic transmission may experience slipping issues. The suspension can also suffer from rust and worn components. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing rust early is crucial to prevent more extensive and expensive repairs.
