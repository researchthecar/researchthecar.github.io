The 2018 Mazda 6 is a mid-size sedan known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. It comes standard with a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. A turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, making 227 horsepower (on 87 octane) or 250 horsepower (on 93 octane) and 310 lb-ft of torque, is also available, also paired with the six-speed automatic. Many owners appreciate the Mazda 6's sharp handling, comfortable ride, and premium feel for its price point. Common criticisms include the infotainment system feeling dated and some wind noise at highway speeds.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels closely and performing regular oil changes can help. In some cases, dealers may perform an oil consumption test. There is no definitive fix for this issue, and it may require replacing piston rings or even the entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $5000+ (engine replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced turbocharger failures, leading to reduced engine power, unusual noises from the engine bay (whining, whistling), and potentially the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: The turbocharger will need to be inspected and likely replaced. It is crucial to diagnose any underlying issues that may have caused the failure, such as oil starvation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can manifest as a noticeable jolt or hesitation during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, it could indicate issues with the valve body or other internal components, requiring more extensive repairs or even a transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Rear Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear of rear suspension components like bushings and links, leading to clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components. A wheel alignment is recommended after the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on components needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system occasionally freezes, reboots unexpectedly, or experiences lag. This can affect navigation, audio, and other system functions.
    *   Solution: Try updating the infotainment system software to the latest version. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500 - $1500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the battery draining prematurely, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws on the battery by aftermarket accessories or faulty components. A battery load test can determine if the battery itself needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (battery replacement) - $100+ (diagnosing parasitic draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, causing condensation. This can reduce headlight effectiveness and potentially damage the headlight components over time.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlights and reseal them. Alternatively, replace the headlight assemblies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (resealing) - $500 - $1000+ (headlight assembly replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattling/Wind Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may rattle or generate excessive wind noise when closed, particularly at highway speeds.
    *   Solution: Inspect the sunroof seals and lubrication of the sunroof tracks. Adjustments or replacements of the seals may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (lubrication/adjustment) - $300 - $800+ (seal replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Loose Trim Pieces**
    * Description/Symptoms: Certain interior trim pieces, particularly around the dashboard or door panels, may become loose or detached.
    * Solution: Reattaching or replacing the affected trim pieces, securing them with adhesive or new clips.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Mazda 6 generally proves reliable, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues mentioned. The turbocharged engine's potential for turbocharger failure is a significant concern given the repair costs. Oil consumption in the naturally aspirated engine, though not necessarily a reliability issue, can be an inconvenience. Electrical glitches with the infotainment and premature suspension wear are also things to be aware of. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs, so a thorough inspection before purchasing is recommended.
