The 2009 Mazda 6 marked a significant redesign for the model, moving to a larger platform and offering increased interior space compared to its predecessor. Engine options included a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 170 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5-liter V6 generating 272 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 was exclusively available with a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Mazda 6 for its sporty handling, attractive styling, and comfortable ride. Common complaints revolve around potential reliability issues, particularly with certain engine components and electrical systems, as well as some interior trim quality concerns.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke (though not always), and the need to add a quart of oil every few hundred to few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to replace the piston rings or the entire engine, which can solve the oil consumption issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The purge control solenoid valve, part of the evaporative emissions system, can fail. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough idling, and potential difficulty starting the car after refueling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the purge control solenoid valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or develop excessive wear, leading to a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. This can also trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (2.5L Engine)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough shifting between gears, particularly during acceleration. Hesitation or delays in shifting may also occur.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush, valve body replacement, or in severe cases, transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (3.5L Engine)**

*   **Slipping/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping, particularly when shifting between gears, or delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse. This is more common in higher mileage vehicles.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush, solenoid replacement, or in severe cases, transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the rear suspension sagging over time, leading to a lower ride height in the rear and potentially affecting handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear springs and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors can fail, leading to a constant TPMS warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty TPMS sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per sensor + labor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power window motors can fail, preventing the window from opening or closing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators can fail, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking with the remote or power door lock switch.

**Summary:**

The 2009 Mazda 6 can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The most concerning problems are the engine issues such as oil consumption on the 2.5L and timing chain issues on the 3.5L. These can be quite costly to repair. Other electrical and suspension issues, while less severe, can still add to the overall cost of ownership. Overall, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, check for maintenance records, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
