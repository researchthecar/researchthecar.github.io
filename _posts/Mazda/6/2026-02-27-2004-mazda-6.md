### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mazda 6 is a reasonably reliable car, but it's not without its potential pitfalls. The most common significant issues tend to revolve around the 2.3L engine's oil consumption and VVT system, as well as potential automatic transmission problems. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and premature alternator failure are also noted concerns. Suspension components like control arm bushings and wheel bearings can wear out. Rust can be an issue depending on climate. While many owners enjoy their Mazda 6s with minimal trouble, prospective buyers should be prepared for potential repairs, especially if purchasing a higher-mileage example. Thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
