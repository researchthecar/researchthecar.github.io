The 2016 Mazda 6 is a mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and attractive styling. It came standard with a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 engine, producing 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. This engine was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. A key advantage of the Mazda 6 is its engaging driving experience and upscale interior for its price point. However, some owners have reported issues with the infotainment system and certain mechanical components.
