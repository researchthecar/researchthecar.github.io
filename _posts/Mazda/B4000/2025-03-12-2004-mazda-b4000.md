The 2004 Mazda B4000 is a compact pickup truck that shares its platform with the Ford Ranger. It offers a practical and affordable option for light-duty tasks. The 2004 B4000 came with two engine options: a 2.3L inline-4 and a 4.0L V6. The 2.3L produced around 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, while the 4.0L generated approximately 207 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the B4000's reliability, compact size, and fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.3L engine). However, some dislike the smaller cab size compared to full-size trucks and the somewhat dated interior. The Mazda B4000 is mostly sold in North America.

**Summary**

The 2004 Mazda B4000, while generally reliable, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The 4.0L V6 engine can suffer from timing chain tensioner problems. The automatic transmission may develop a torque converter shudder. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are also known to wear out. Rust, especially in areas with road salt, is a significant concern. Electrical issues, such as window motor and blend door actuator failures, can also occur. Interior issues, like cracking dashboards and broken seat recliner handles, are cosmetic concerns. The severity and cost of repairs vary, with rust repair and engine work being the most expensive. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, paying close attention to these common problem areas, and factor in potential repair costs when making a purchasing decision.
