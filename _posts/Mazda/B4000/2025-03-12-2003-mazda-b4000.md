**Summary**

The 2003 Mazda B4000, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The 4.0L V6 is prone to timing chain rattle and thermostat housing leaks. Both manual and automatic transmissions are generally reliable but automatics can experience harsh shifting or slipping with age. Suspension issues like ball joint wear and leaf spring sagging are also common. Electrical problems include door lock actuator failure and instrument cluster malfunctions. Rust can be a significant issue, especially in certain climates. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but potential buyers should be aware of them and inspect the vehicle carefully before purchasing.
