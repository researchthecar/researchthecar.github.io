**Introduction:**
The 2006 Mazda B4000 is a compact pickup truck offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. It is known for its ruggedness, reliability, and affordable price point. However, like all vehicles, it has some common issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**
**3.0L V6**
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Occurs when the gasket between the intake manifold and cylinder head fails, causing a vacuum leak. Symptoms include rough idling, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure:** The camshaft position sensor monitors the camshaft position and sends signals to the engine computer. Failure of this sensor can lead to engine misfires, stalling, and difficulty starting. Solution: Replace the camshaft position sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
* **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt is a critical component that synchronizes the timing of the camshaft and crankshaft. Failure of the timing belt can result in catastrophic engine damage. Solution: Replace the timing belt according to the manufacturer's recommended intervals. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $600
**Recalls:** NHTSA Campaign Number: 06V424000

**2.3L I4**
* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**
**5-Speed Manual**
* **Clutch Failure:** The clutch is a consumable part that engages and disengages the transmission from the engine. Failure of the clutch can result in difficulty shifting gears or the inability to engage gears. Solution: Replace the clutch kit. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
* **Transmission Input Shaft Bearing Failure:** The input shaft bearing supports the transmission input shaft. Failure of this bearing can lead to grinding noises, difficulty shifting gears, and eventually transmission failure. Solution: Replace the transmission input shaft bearing. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200
**Recalls:** NHTSA Campaign Number: 06V418000

**4-Speed Automatic**
* **Transmission Fluid Leak:** The 4-speed automatic transmission is prone to fluid leaks from the transmission pan gasket or other seals. Symptoms include low transmission fluid levels, slipping gears, and delayed engagement. Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
* **Overdrive Solenoid Failure:** The overdrive solenoid controls the engagement of the overdrive gear. Failure of this solenoid can result in the inability to engage overdrive, reduced fuel efficiency, and increased engine noise. Solution: Replace the overdrive solenoid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
**Recalls:** None Found

**Suspension**
* **Front Suspension Ball Joint Failure:** The front suspension ball joints connect the control arms to the steering knuckles. Failure of the ball joints can cause clunking noises, premature tire wear, and reduced steering control. Solution: Replace the faulty ball joints. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
* **Leaf Spring Failure:** The rear suspension leaf springs can sag or break over time, leading to reduced ride height, poor handling, and increased tire wear. Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800

**Electrical**
* **Battery Drain:** Some owners have reported experiencing battery drain issues. The cause can vary, but common culprits include faulty relays, parasitic draws, or a weak battery. Solution: Diagnose the cause of the battery drain and repair or replace the affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator is responsible for charging the battery. Failure of the alternator can result in a dead battery and the inability to start the vehicle. Solution: Replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
* **Recalls:** NHTSA Campaign Number: 06V395000
