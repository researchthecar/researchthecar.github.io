The 2006 Mazda B4000 is a compact pickup truck, essentially a rebadged Ford Ranger. Available engines included a 2.3L inline-4 and a 4.0L V6. The 4.0L V6 produced approximately 207 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque. The B4000 was appreciated for its reliability, affordability, and compact size, making it easy to maneuver and park. However, its fuel economy, interior space, and outdated design were often cited as drawbacks. The issues mentioned below reflect typical concerns for a vehicle of this age.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough running, check engine light illuminated. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) related to the camshaft position sensor.
    * Solution: Replacement of the camshaft position sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Thermostat Housing Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak near the thermostat housing, overheating, low coolant level.
    * Solution: Replacement of the thermostat housing and gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, particularly when the engine is cold.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the IAC valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $80-$250+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, poor fuel economy. Often pinpointed by diagnostic codes and individual injector testing.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per injector (depending on location and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration, particularly at highway speeds. Can be misdiagnosed as an engine issue.
    * Solution: Transmission flush and fluid replacement using a fluid with a friction modifier additive (specifically designed for shudder issues). In severe cases, torque converter replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 for flush; $800 - $1500+ for torque converter replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Shift Flare**
    * Description/Symptoms: A momentary increase in engine RPMs between shifts, indicating slippage within the transmission.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid change can alleviate the issue. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 for flush; $500 - $2000+ for valve body/rebuild
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, particularly noticeable when carrying a load. Cracked or broken leaf springs.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side (depending on brand and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Ball Joint Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Steering looseness.
    * Solution: Replacement of the ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side (depending on upper/lower and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Windshield Wiper Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Wipers not working, intermittent operation, or only working on certain speeds.
    * Solution: Replacement of the windshield wiper motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door lock not working, intermittent operation.
    * Solution: Replacement of the door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust (Especially in Areas Prone to Corrosion)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the lower body panels, wheel wells, and frame.
    * Solution: Rust repair, panel replacement, or frame repair depending on the severity.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on severity and location
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Mazda B4000, while generally reliable for its age, can exhibit issues related to its engine (especially sensors and leaks in the 4.0L V6), transmission (torque converter shudder in the automatic), suspension (leaf spring sag and ball joint wear), and electrical system (wiper motor and door lock actuators). Rust is also a common concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. The severity and cost of repairs vary greatly depending on the specific issue and its progression. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix (sensor replacements), others like transmission repairs or rust remediation can be significantly more costly.
