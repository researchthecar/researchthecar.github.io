### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mazda B4000 is a generally dependable compact truck, especially for its age. The powertrains, particularly the V6 engines, are known for their robustness, though specific issues like intake manifold leaks on the 3.0L and timing chain wear on the 4.0L can arise. Automatic transmissions may experience torque converter or solenoid problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items. Electrical issues often center around the alternator and power window regulators. Exterior concerns primarily involve rust, a common issue for trucks of this vintage, and cloudy headlights. Interior problems are typically limited to HVAC blower motors and general wear on upholstery. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing these known issues, the B4000 can continue to be a reliable workhorse.
