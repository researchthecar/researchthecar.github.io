The 1997 Mazda B4000 is a mid-size pickup truck that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The standard engine was a 2.5L inline-four that produced 142 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. A 3.0L V6 was also available, which produced 155 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque.
