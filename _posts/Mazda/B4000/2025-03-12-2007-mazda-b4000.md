The 2007 Mazda B4000 is a compact pickup truck that is mechanically identical to the Ford Ranger of the same era. It offers a practical and affordable option for light-duty hauling and utility. While appreciated for its simplicity, reliability (relative to newer trucks), and compact size, it is often criticized for its outdated design, fuel economy, and lack of modern features. The 2007 Mazda B4000 came with two engine options: a 2.3L I4 engine producing 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, and the more common 4.0L Cologne V6 engine which produces 207 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine.

**Summary**

The 2007 Mazda B4000, like its Ford Ranger counterpart, is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues related to the timing chain (particularly on the 4.0L V6), suspension components (leaf springs and ball joints), and electrical components (blend door actuator and door ajar sensors). Rust is also a significant concern, especially in areas with road salt. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs varying accordingly. Regular maintenance and inspections can help prevent or mitigate these problems.
