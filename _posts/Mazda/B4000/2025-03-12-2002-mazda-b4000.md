The 2002 Mazda B4000 is a compact pickup truck, essentially a rebadged Ford Ranger. It was available with two engine options: a 2.3L inline-4 and a 4.0L V6. The 4.0L V6 produces around 207 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque. People generally appreciate the B4000 for its reliability, affordability, and compact size, making it easy to maneuver. However, some common complaints include a relatively basic interior, limited rear seat space in the extended cab models, and fuel economy that is typical for trucks of this size and age. The information below focuses on issues beyond normal wear and tear specific to the 2002 Mazda B4000, focusing on the 4.0L V6 engine.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, especially on startup, is a common symptom. If left unaddressed, this can lead to timing chain slippage, causing severe engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioners, guides, and potentially the timing chains themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Upper and Lower Intake Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vacuum leaks can cause rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light. Often, the plastic manifolds crack or the gaskets degrade over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gaskets, and potentially the intake manifold itself if cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Synchronizer Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft synchronizer (also sometimes referred to as a cam position sensor synchronizer) can fail, causing a squealing or chirping noise from the engine. This can also trigger the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft synchronizer and possibly the cam position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Automatic Transmission**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This is often due to a worn torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift. This can be caused by worn or sticking valves in the valve body.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking, popping, or squeaking noises from the front suspension. Loose or worn ball joints can also cause poor handling and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken Leaves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially when loaded. Broken leaf springs can also cause a rough ride and reduced load capacity.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (for both sides)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic readings, flickering lights, or complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate or operating slowly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the rocker panels, cab corners, and wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Cutting out the rust and welding in new metal, followed by bodywork and paint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or installing a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2002 Mazda B4000, particularly with the 4.0L V6, has some common issues centered around engine maintenance (timing chain tensioners, intake manifold leaks) and transmission wear (torque converter, valve body). Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also prone to wear and tear due to the age of the vehicle. Electrical issues, such as instrument cluster and window motor failures, can occur. Rust, particularly on the lower body panels, is a common concern depending on the climate where the truck has been driven. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like transmission rebuilding or extensive rust repair, can be more costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas before purchasing. The severity of the issues can vary, but addressing them promptly can prevent more significant problems and extend the life of the vehicle.
