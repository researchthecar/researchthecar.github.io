The 2005 Mazda B3000 is a compact pickup truck based on the Ford Ranger platform. It was offered with three engine options: a 2.3L inline-4 (143 hp, 154 lb-ft), a 3.0L V6 (148 hp, 180 lb-ft), and a 4.0L V6 (207 hp, 238 lb-ft). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the B3000 for its reliability, affordability, and compact size, making it suitable for city driving and light-duty tasks. Common complaints include its relatively low power output (especially with the smaller engines) and dated interior.
