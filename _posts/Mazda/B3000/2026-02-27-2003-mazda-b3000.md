### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mazda B3000 is a generally dependable compact truck, especially when equipped with the 3.0L V6 engine. While it doesn't suffer from widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of potential issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and spark plug blowout on the V6. The automatic transmission can sometimes develop issues with the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items for trucks of this age and mileage. Electrical systems are mostly robust, though alternators and window regulators can fail. Exterior rust, particularly on frame rails, is a significant concern for trucks in rust-prone areas. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor and door lock actuators are also known to require replacement over time. Overall, with proper maintenance and attention to these common issues, the B3000 can remain a reliable vehicle.
