The 2006 Mazda B3000 is a compact pickup truck largely based on the Ford Ranger. The B3000 offers a practical and affordable option for those needing a smaller truck. Engine options include a 2.3L inline-4 (approximately 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0L V6 (approximately 148 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque). A 4.0L V6 was available on the Ford Ranger during this model year but not the Mazda B3000. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the B3000's reliability (relative to its age), compact size making it easy to maneuver, and simple maintenance. Common complaints revolve around the underpowered engine options, especially when towing or hauling, and the dated interior.
