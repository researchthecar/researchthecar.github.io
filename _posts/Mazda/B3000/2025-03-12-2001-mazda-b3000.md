The 2001 Mazda B3000 is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and affordability. It's essentially a rebadged Ford Ranger, sharing many components and design features. Engine options include a 2.5L 4-cylinder (approximately 119 hp and 146 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L V6 (approximately 150 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque), and a 4.0L V6 (approximately 207 hp and 238 lb-ft of torque). Available transmissions are a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the truck's compact size, making it easy to maneuver and park.
