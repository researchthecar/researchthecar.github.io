The 2003 Mazda B3000 is a compact pickup truck based on the Ford Ranger. It was available with a few engine options: the 2.3L inline-four, the 3.0L Vulcan V6 (making around 150 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque), and the 4.0L Cologne V6. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the B3000 for its simplicity, reliability, and affordability. Common dislikes include the smaller interior space and the somewhat dated styling. The 3.0L V6 was a popular choice for its balance of power and fuel economy, though it is not known to be the most powerful, efficient, or reliable engine on the market.
