The 2003 Mazda B3000 was a compact pickup truck offered with two engine options: a 2.3-liter inline-four and a 3.0-liter V6. The 2.3-liter engine produced 147 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0-liter engine produced 170 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a five-speed manual transmission, with a four-speed automatic transmission available as an option.

The B3000 was praised for its affordability, reliability, and capable handling. However, it was criticized for its lack of power and refinement compared to its competitors.
