The 2007 Mazda B3000 is a compact pickup truck that's essentially a rebadged Ford Ranger. The B3000 offers a practical and affordable option for those needing a smaller truck. The 2007 model is available with a 3.0L Vulcan V6 engine that produces approximately 148 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. Another engine option is the 2.3L inline 4-cylinder engine. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the B3000's reliability, compact size for city driving, and decent fuel economy. Common dislikes include its relatively basic interior, limited cargo capacity compared to full-size trucks, and a somewhat dated design.

**Summary**

The 2007 Mazda B3000, while generally reliable, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues such as EGR valve and thermostat housing failures in the 3.0L V6, and camshaft position sensor issues in the 2.3L are fairly common and are not too costly to repair. Transmission problems, particularly erratic shifting in the automatic, can be more serious and expensive. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also subject to wear and tear. Electrical gremlins, like instrument cluster and door lock actuator failures, can also surface. Rust on body panels is another common concern. Overall, the B3000 is a decent truck, but addressing these potential issues can ensure a better ownership experience. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but potential buyers should factor these possibilities into their purchase decision.
