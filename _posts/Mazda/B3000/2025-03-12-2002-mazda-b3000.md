The 2002 Mazda B3000 is a compact pickup truck that was essentially a rebadged Ford Ranger. This model year offered three engine options: a 2.3L inline-four, a 3.0L Vulcan V6, and a 4.0L Cologne V6. The 3.0L V6, the focus of this report, produced approximately 150 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the B3000 for its affordability, reliability, and compact size, making it suitable for light-duty tasks and city driving. Common complaints often revolve around its relatively basic interior, fuel economy (especially with the V6 engines), and potential rust issues in certain climates. While offering decent utility, it wasn't known for its performance or advanced features.

**Summary**

The 2002 Mazda B3000, sharing much of its DNA with the Ford Ranger, is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any older vehicle, it's prone to certain issues. Engine-related problems such as intake manifold gasket leaks and camshaft synchronizer failures on the 3.0L V6 can be moderate in cost. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs wear out over time, leading to handling and ride quality issues. Electrical problems like instrument cluster malfunctions and power window motor failures are also common. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in regions with road salt. Overall, the cost of addressing these issues can range from relatively inexpensive repairs to more substantial investments, particularly for rust repair or transmission work.
