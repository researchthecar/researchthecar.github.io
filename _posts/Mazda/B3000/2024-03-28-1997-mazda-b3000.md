**1997 Mazda B3000**

The 1997 Mazda B3000 was a compact pickup truck offered with a 2.3L inline-4 engine or a 3.0L V6 engine. The 2.3L engine produced 142 horsepower and 153 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0L engine produced 190 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The B3000 was praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and powerful V6 engine. However, it was also criticized for its poor fuel economy and lack of off-road capabilities.
