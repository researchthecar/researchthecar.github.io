**Introduction**

The 2006 Mazda B3000 is a mid-size pickup truck available in single or extended cab configurations. It offers a choice of two engine and transmission options: a 2.3L 4-cylinder engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, or a 3.0L V6 engine with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The 2.3L engine produces 153 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0L V6 delivers 220 horsepower and 204 lb-ft of torque.
