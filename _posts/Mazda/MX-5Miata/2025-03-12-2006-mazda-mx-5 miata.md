The 2006 Mazda MX-5 Miata, part of the NC generation, is a beloved roadster known for its nimble handling, engaging driving experience, and relatively affordable price. The 2006 model year was the inaugural year for the NC generation and had only one engine option. This engine is a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 170 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. This generation comes with either a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, or a 6-speed automatic transmission option. Owners typically praise the MX-5 for its fun factor, precise steering, and open-top enjoyment. Common dislikes include a small cabin size, limited cargo space, and potential for some reliability issues.
