**Engine**

**2.0L SKYACTIV-G I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes. The issue can range from needing to add a quart every few thousand miles to more frequent additions. There is often no visible leak or smoke.
    *   Solution: In some cases, dealers have performed oil consumption tests and, if deemed excessive, replaced the engine under warranty. For out-of-warranty vehicles, the solutions can range from trying different oil weights or brands to replacing piston rings or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the severity and chosen solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the evaporative emissions purge valve. This can cause rough idling, difficulty starting after refueling, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Grinding/Difficulty Shifting into 2nd Gear (Especially when cold)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience difficulty shifting into 2nd gear, especially when the transmission is cold. This can manifest as a grinding noise or a general resistance to engaging the gear.
    *   Solution: Some owners have reported success with changing the transmission fluid to a higher-quality synthetic fluid. In more severe cases, synchro replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+ (depending on solution and if synchro replacement is required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Squeaking Sounds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported squeaking noises coming from the suspension, particularly from the front. This can be more noticeable when going over bumps or during cornering. The noise may be intermittent.
    *   Solution: Inspect and lubricate the suspension components, including the sway bar bushings, ball joints, and control arm bushings. Replacement of worn bushings or ball joints may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the worn/damaged components)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the car is not driven frequently. This can result in the car not starting or requiring a jump start.
    *   Solution: Check the battery's health and replace it if necessary. Also, check for any parasitic drains on the battery, such as aftermarket accessories or faulty electrical components. A battery tender or maintainer can also help prevent this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system can sometimes freeze, lag, or spontaneously reboot. This can affect the radio, navigation, and other connected features.
    *   Solution: Updating the software to the latest version can often resolve this issue. In some cases, a hard reset of the system or replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $1000+ (for unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Leaks (Soft Top Models)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Soft-top owners sometimes report water leaks, especially around the windows and seals during heavy rain or car washes.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the top's latches, applying sealant to the seams, or replacing worn weather stripping can help resolve this issue. In severe cases, top replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Paint Chipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The paint on some Mazda vehicles, including the MX-5 Miata, is known to be relatively thin and prone to chipping, especially on the front bumper and hood.
    *   Solution: Touching up the paint chips with touch-up paint or having the affected areas professionally repainted. Applying a clear bra or paint protection film can help prevent future chipping.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling noises emanating from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, and seats. These rattles can be particularly annoying on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the rattle and applying felt tape or other sound-deadening material to the affected areas. Tightening loose screws or fasteners can also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ (depending on if it's a DIY job)
    *   Recalls: None Found
