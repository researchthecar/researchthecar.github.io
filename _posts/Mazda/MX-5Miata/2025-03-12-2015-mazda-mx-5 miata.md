The 2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata (ND generation) marked a return to form for the iconic roadster, emphasizing lightweight construction and engaging driving dynamics. It was offered with only one engine option, a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 155 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally praise the car's nimble handling, communicative steering, and overall fun-to-drive character. Criticisms often revolve around the limited interior space, road noise, and relatively modest power output compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L SkyActiv-G Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption (Early Production)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners of early 2015 models reported higher than expected oil consumption. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil between oil changes and, in some cases, blue smoke from the exhaust. This was more prevalent in manual transmission cars.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Mazda replaced the short block under warranty. For others, switching to a higher viscosity oil may mitigate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (warranty) or $3,000+ (out-of-pocket engine replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Grinding when shifting into 2nd or 3rd gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported grinding noises or difficulty when shifting into 2nd or 3rd gear, especially when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid with a higher quality synthetic fluid may help. In more severe cases, the synchros may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$100 (fluid change) or $1,000 - $2,000+ (synchro replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Hesitation When Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting up or down gears is a common issue. The car may rev higher than usual before shifting.
    *   Solution: A software update can usually fix the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system can experience freezing, lag, and spontaneous reboots. This is particularly prevalent in early production models.
    *   Solution: Performing a software update or system reset may resolve the issue. In some cases, the entire unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) or $500 - $1000+ (unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks can occur around the convertible top, particularly at the seams or where the top meets the windshield frame. This is more common in older models or those exposed to harsh weather.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the latches, lubricating the seals, or replacing the seals may address the issue. In severe cases, the top itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100 (seal lubrication/adjustment) or $500 - $2000+ (top replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata is generally a reliable car, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The most common problems involve the infotainment system, the 6-speed manual transmission, convertible top leaks, and, in some early production cars, excessive oil consumption. While some fixes, like software updates or fluid changes, are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission repairs, can be costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the car's condition and history, paying particular attention to these areas.
