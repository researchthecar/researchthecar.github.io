Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2021 Mazda MX-5 Miata, categorized for clarity.

The 2021 Mazda MX-5 Miata is a beloved roadster known for its agile handling, engaging driving experience, and classic styling. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder producing 181 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. This engine can be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the car's fun-to-drive nature, responsive steering, and compact size, but some find the interior cramped, the trunk space limited, and the ride can be a bit firm for long distances.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Rattling/Ticking Noise at Startup (Variable Valve Timing Actuator)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling or ticking noise is heard from the engine bay upon cold startup. This is commonly attributed to the Variable Valve Timing (VVT) actuator not receiving oil pressure immediately, leading to momentary noise until lubrication is established. The noise usually disappears after a few seconds.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VVT actuator and check valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Grinding During Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting into gears, particularly 1st and 2nd, accompanied by a grinding noise. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Some owners have reported improvement with transmission fluid changes using a high-quality synthetic fluid, while others require synchro replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid change), $1500+ (synchro replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps or during turns. This can often be attributed to worn or dry bushings.
    *   Solution: Lubricate or replace suspension bushings (sway bar bushings, control arm bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system occasionally freezes, crashes, or reboots unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and other system functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset, updating the software to the latest version, or, in some cases, replacing the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update), $500+ (replacement unit)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven for several days.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws, replace battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the edges of the convertible top, particularly during heavy rain or car washes.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the top latches, replacing weather stripping, or resealing the top.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Creaking/Popping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seats, particularly the driver's seat, emit creaking or popping noises when shifting weight or during cornering.
    *   Solution: Tighten seat bolts, lubricate seat tracks, or replace seat frame components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rattling From Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard or interior trim pieces, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Securing loose trim pieces, adding foam padding to prevent vibration.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Mazda MX-5 Miata is generally a reliable car, but like any vehicle, it has some common issues. The engine ticking at startup and transmission grinding are the most significant potential problems. While most issues are relatively minor and can be addressed with simple fixes, some electrical and convertible top concerns could lead to more substantial repair costs. Overall, the severity of these issues is moderate, and the cost to fix them varies widely depending on the specific problem.
