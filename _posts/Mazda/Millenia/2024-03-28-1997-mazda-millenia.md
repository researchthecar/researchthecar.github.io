**Introduction**

The 1997 Mazda Millenia is a mid-size sedan that was available with two engine options and two transmission options. The base engine was a 2.5-liter V6 that produced 170 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 2.3-liter turbocharged V6 that produced 210 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.
