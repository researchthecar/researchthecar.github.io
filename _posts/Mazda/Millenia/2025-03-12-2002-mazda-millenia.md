The 2002 Mazda Millenia was a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride and distinctive styling. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L V6 producing 170 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque and a supercharged 2.3L Miller-cycle V6 producing 210 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Millenia for its quiet cabin and upscale features, but some disliked its reliability issues and higher maintenance costs, especially with the Miller-cycle engine.

**Summary:** The 2002 Mazda Millenia, while offering a comfortable and somewhat luxurious driving experience, is prone to several issues. Engine oil leaks, particularly in both engine options, and transmission problems are relatively common and can be costly to repair. The 2.3L Miller-cycle engine has specific supercharger related issues that also can be costly. Suspension and electrical problems, while less severe, contribute to the overall maintenance burden. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in higher maintenance costs when considering purchasing this vehicle.
