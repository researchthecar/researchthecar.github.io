The 2000 Mazda Millenia was a mid-size luxury sedan known for its sophisticated styling and available Miller-cycle V6 engine. The standard engine was a 2.5L V6 producing 170 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine was a 2.3L Miller-cycle V6, delivering 210 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Millenia's comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and unique engine technology. However, the car was sometimes criticized for its complex engine design (particularly the Miller-cycle version), which could lead to higher maintenance costs. The Miller-cycle engine also sometimes came with issues, as well as other issues the car would experience that any car around that year would experience.
