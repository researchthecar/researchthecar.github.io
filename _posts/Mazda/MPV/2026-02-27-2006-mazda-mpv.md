### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mazda MPV is a generally reliable family vehicle, but like many minivans of its vintage, it is not without its potential issues. The most common concerns revolve around the automatic transmission, particularly harsh shifting or slipping, and potential oil leaks or PCV system clogs in the 2.3L engine. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical problems, often stemming from the BCM or alternator failure, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. While not a perfect vehicle, addressing these common issues can help maintain the MPV's utility and longevity.
