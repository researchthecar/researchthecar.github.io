### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mazda MPV, while a practical choice, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and class. Owners should be aware of potential issues with oil leaks and cooling system integrity in the engines, particularly the 2.0L. The automatic transmission can experience slipping or overheating, often requiring attention to fluid maintenance and potentially more significant repairs. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are prone to wear, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, such as power window motors and alternators, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the blower motor may fail. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the MPV's reliability.
