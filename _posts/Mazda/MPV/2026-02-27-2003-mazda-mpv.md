### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mazda MPV exhibits some common issues typical for vehicles of its age and segment. Engine and transmission reliability can be a concern, with oil/coolant leaks and transmission slipping being the most frequently reported. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can arise. Exterior rust can be an issue depending on climate, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor resistor are known failure points. While not a perfect vehicle, addressing these potential problems proactively can contribute to a more reliable ownership experience.
