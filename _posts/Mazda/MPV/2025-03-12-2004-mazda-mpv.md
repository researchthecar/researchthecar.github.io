The 2004 Mazda MPV is a minivan known for its car-like handling and responsive steering. It came with a single engine option, a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 200 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the MPV's maneuverability and smaller size compared to other minivans, making it easier to park and drive in urban environments.
