The 2003 Mazda MPV is a minivan offering a blend of practicality and a slightly sporty driving experience for its class. It's powered by a 3.0L Duratec V6 engine, producing around 200 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the MPV's nimble handling and relatively compact size compared to other minivans, making it easier to maneuver and park. However, some common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly concerning the transmission, and certain engine components.

**Engine**

**3.0L Duratec V6**

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, clunking noises, especially during acceleration or deceleration. The engine mount rubber degrades over time, leading to increased movement of the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed engine mount(s). Typically, the front and rear mounts are the most common to fail.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per mount, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, reduced power, and a check engine light. The issue can be intermittent at first, then become more frequent.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil. It's often recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per coil, plus labor. Full set replacement could be $300 - $600.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling Fan Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, especially at idle or in stop-and-go traffic. The cooling fan either stops working entirely or operates erratically.
    *   Solution: Replace the cooling fan assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates to shift, or shifts roughly. Engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If that doesn't solve the issue, more serious repairs, like replacing solenoids or rebuilding the transmission, may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush and filter: $100 - $250. Solenoid replacement: $300 - $800. Transmission rebuild: $2000 - $4000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: When shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse, there is a noticeable delay before the transmission engages. This can be accompanied by a clunking noise.
    *   Solution: This is often related to low transmission fluid or internal wear. Start with a fluid and filter change. If the issue persists, internal inspection and possible rebuild are required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush and filter: $100 - $250. Transmission rebuild: $2000 - $4000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll in corners, and leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts/shocks. Replacing them in pairs (front or rear) is recommended for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per pair, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per pair, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks stop working intermittently or completely. One or more doors may not lock or unlock with the power lock switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350 per door, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sliding Door Issues (Power)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power sliding doors fail to open or close properly, get stuck, or make unusual noises. This can be due to a faulty motor, worn rollers, or damaged wiring.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair the sliding door mechanism. This may involve replacing the motor, rollers, wiring harness, or the entire sliding door assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the specific problem and parts required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, especially around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage. This is more prevalent in areas with harsh winters and road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, which may involve sanding, patching, and repainting. Severe rust may require panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+, depending on the extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing in the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or repair with a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dashboard cover: $50 - $200. Dashboard replacement: $500 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found
