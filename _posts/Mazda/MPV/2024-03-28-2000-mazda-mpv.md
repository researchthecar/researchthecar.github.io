**Introduction**

The 2000 Mazda MPV is a mid-size minivan that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 2.5-liter V6 that produced 170 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 3.0-liter V6 was optional, producing 200 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual transmission. The MPV was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and versatile seating arrangements. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, poor fuel economy, and dated interior design.
