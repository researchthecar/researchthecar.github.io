The 2001 Mazda MPV is a minivan appreciated for its nimble handling compared to competitors and its car-like driving feel. It came equipped with a single engine option, a 2.5L V6 producing 170 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Common praises include its maneuverability and relatively compact size, making it easier to park and drive in urban environments. Criticisms often focus on its dated styling, limited cargo space compared to larger minivans, and some reliability concerns associated with its age.

*   **Engine Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the leak's location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Catalytic converters can fail due to age or contamination, leading to poor engine performance, reduced fuel economy, and a check engine light (typically a P0420 code).
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks can wear out, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for parts and labor (for all four).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front control arm bushings can wear out over time, causing clunking noises when going over bumps, loose steering feel, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on whether just the bushings or the entire arm is replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks. Could be related to a failing actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the door lock actuator.

**Summary**

The 2001 Mazda MPV, while appreciated for its car-like handling and compact size, exhibits several common issues related to its age. Engine oil leaks and catalytic converter failures are prevalent engine concerns, while transmission slipping is a potential issue with the automatic transmission. Suspension wear, electrical problems, rust, and interior component failures also contribute to the overall maintenance costs. While some issues are relatively minor, others, such as transmission problems, can be costly to repair. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor potential repair costs into their purchasing decision.
