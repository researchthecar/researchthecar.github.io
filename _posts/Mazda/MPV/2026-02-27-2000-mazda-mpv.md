### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mazda MPV, while offering practicality, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for vehicles of its age and class. Engine oil and coolant leaks are frequently reported, particularly with the V6 engine, which also carries a risk of timing belt issues if not maintained. Automatic transmission problems like slipping and overheating can be costly to repair. Suspension components such as ball joints and tie rods are prone to wear, leading to steering and noise issues. Electrical gremlins, including alternator and window regulator failures, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on climate. Interior issues like HVAC blower motor and door lock actuator failures are also present. Regular maintenance, especially for the V6 timing belt and transmission fluid, is crucial for mitigating these potential problems.
