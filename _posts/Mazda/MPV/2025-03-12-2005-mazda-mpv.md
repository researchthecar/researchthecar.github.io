Engine oil leaks, transmission problems, and electrical malfunctions, particularly with the power sliding doors and door lock actuators, are common complaints. Rust can also be a significant issue, especially in regions with harsh winters or salted roads. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing ignition coils to more costly repairs such as transmission rebuilds or body work for rust. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle for these common problems and factor in potential repair costs.
