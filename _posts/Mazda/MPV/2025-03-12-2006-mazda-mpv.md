The 2006 Mazda MPV is a minivan powered by a 3.0L Duratec 24-valve DOHC V6 engine producing 200 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the MPV's nimble handling for a minivan, its comfortable ride, and its relatively compact size compared to other minivans. Common complaints include subpar fuel economy for its class and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**3.0L Duratec V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often originating from valve cover gaskets and the front crankshaft seal, leading to oil consumption and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets and front crankshaft seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating. Often caused by worn or damaged ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It is recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminating with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420), reduced fuel economy, and potential failure to pass emissions testing.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shifting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifting, slipping between gears, and difficulty engaging certain gears. These issues are often related to worn transmission fluid, a faulty transmission control module (TCM), or internal component wear.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be needed, potentially leading to TCM replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) to $2500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at low speeds, especially during acceleration, can indicate a failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. This often involves removing and reinstalling the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, and reduced handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Sway Bar Links/Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn sway bar links and/or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power sliding doors failing to open or close properly, getting stuck, or making unusual noises. This can be due to motor failure, damaged tracks, or sensor issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific issue (motor, track, sensor) and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster, including gauges and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust, especially in areas prone to salt exposure (wheel wells, rocker panels, undercarriage).
    *   Solution: Remove the rust and replace damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate properly, getting stuck, or making grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Mazda MPV has several common issues, with engine and transmission problems being the most concerning due to their potential cost and impact on reliability. Oil leaks, ignition coil failure, and catalytic converter problems are prevalent engine issues. Shifting problems and torque converter issues plague the 5-speed automatic transmission. Suspension wear is also common. The severity of these issues varies, but neglecting them can lead to more extensive and expensive repairs. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and obtain a pre-purchase inspection to assess the vehicle's condition.
