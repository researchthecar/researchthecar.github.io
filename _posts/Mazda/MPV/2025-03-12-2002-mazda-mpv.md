The 2002 Mazda MPV is a minivan that was popular for its relatively sporty handling and versatile interior. It was offered with a single engine option, a 3.0L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the MPV's maneuverability and car-like feel, making it easier to drive than larger minivans. However, some common complaints revolve around its reliability, particularly concerning transmission issues and electrical problems. The MPV is valued for its compact size and fuel efficiency relative to other minivans but can lack some of the storage and interior space offered by its competitors.
