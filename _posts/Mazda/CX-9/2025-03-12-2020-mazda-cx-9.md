Alright, here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints related to the 2020 Mazda CX-9, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2020 Mazda CX-9 is a three-row mid-size SUV lauded for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. All 2020 CX-9 models come standard with a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 227 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque on regular fuel, or 250 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque on premium fuel. This engine is paired exclusively with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the CX-9's responsive handling, comfortable ride, and premium feel. Common complaints often revolve around the relatively cramped third-row seating, limited cargo space compared to some rivals, and the somewhat dated infotainment system.

**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling or grinding noises from the engine bay, check engine light illumination. May be due to oil starvation or bearing failure.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Diagnose the root cause of the failure to prevent recurrence (e.g., oil lines, oil quality, maintenance).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Requires frequent oil top-offs between oil changes. May be accompanied by blue-ish exhaust smoke, particularly during acceleration.
    *   Solution: First, conduct an oil consumption test to verify the amount of oil being consumed. If deemed excessive, potential solutions may include replacing the valve stem seals, piston rings, or even the entire engine, depending on the severity and cause. A leak-down test can help pinpoint the source of the consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
