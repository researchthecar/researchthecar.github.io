### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mazda CX-9 generally presents a good reliability record, especially concerning its powertrain. The 3.7L V6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission are robust, though potential issues like intake manifold runner control actuator failure and VVT system problems can arise with age and mileage. Suspension components, particularly bushings and strut mounts, may require attention. Electrical gremlins can include power window issues and infotainment glitches. Interior concerns are often related to sunroof drains and HVAC blower resistors. Overall, the CX-9 is a solid choice, but prospective buyers should be aware of these potential, albeit not universal, reliability points and factor in potential repair costs for these specific components.
