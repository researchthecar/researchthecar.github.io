The 2017 Mazda CX-9 is a popular mid-size SUV known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. It comes exclusively with a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, producing 227 horsepower (on 87 octane fuel) or 250 horsepower (on 93 octane fuel) and 310 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the CX-9's responsive handling, comfortable ride, and premium feel. However, some common complaints include the somewhat cramped third-row seating, fuel economy that doesn't always live up to expectations, and the infotainment system, which some find less intuitive than competitors.
