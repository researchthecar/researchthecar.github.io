The 2018 Mazda CX-9 is a three-row mid-size SUV known for its sporty handling, upscale interior, and stylish design. It's powered by a single engine option: a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 227 horsepower (on 87 octane) or 250 horsepower (on 93 octane) and 310 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the CX-9's responsive driving dynamics and premium feel, but some common complaints include limited third-row space and the relatively small cargo area when all three rows are in use.
