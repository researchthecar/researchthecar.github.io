The 2016 Mazda CX-9 marked a significant redesign for the model, introducing a more premium feel and improved driving dynamics. It came exclusively with a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 227 hp (on 87 octane) or 250 hp (on 93 octane) and 310 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the CX-9 for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and responsive handling. However, some common complaints include the relatively small third-row seating, limited cargo space with all seats in use, and some reliability concerns regarding the engine and infotainment system.
