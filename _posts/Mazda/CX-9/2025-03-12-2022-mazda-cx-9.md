The 2022 Mazda CX-9 is a mid-size three-row SUV known for its sporty handling, upscale interior, and stylish design. It comes with a single engine option: a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 227 horsepower (on 87 octane fuel) or 250 horsepower (on 93 octane fuel) and 310 lb-ft of torque (on 87 octane fuel) or 320 lb-ft of torque (on 93 octane fuel). The engine is paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the CX-9 for its engaging driving experience, premium feel, and comfortable seats. Common complaints include its smaller third-row seat compared to competitors and its infotainment system, which, while improved, is still not as intuitive as some others.

**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the issue is related to faulty PCV valves or turbocharger seals. Replacing these components can alleviate the problem. In more severe cases, engine components like piston rings may need inspection and potential replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve) - $3,000+ (Engine Work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported turbocharger failure, leading to a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling), and potential check engine lights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger. Ensure the replacement part is properly installed and that oil lines are correctly connected to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of harsh or delayed shifting between gears, particularly during cold starts or under heavy acceleration. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or hesitation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush or replacement may be necessary. In rare cases, valve body repair or replacement might be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the noise involves inspecting the rear shocks, sway bar links, and bushings. Replacing worn or damaged components can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced freezing, lagging, or unresponsive behavior from the infotainment system. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates for the infotainment system and install the latest version. In some cases, a hard reset of the system may be required. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,000+ (Head Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic drains on the battery, which can be caused by faulty modules or accessories. A diagnostic test can identify the source of the drain. Replacing the battery with a higher-capacity one or using a battery maintainer can help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises in the Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling noises emanating from within the dashboard, particularly on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the rattle can be challenging. It may involve disassembling parts of the dashboard to identify loose clips, wiring harnesses, or components. Adding padding or securing loose items can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Mazda CX-9 is generally a reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues related to engine oil consumption, turbocharger failure, transmission shifting, suspension noises, electrical glitches, and interior rattles. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, with engine and turbocharger problems potentially being the most expensive to address. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any unusual symptoms can help prevent more significant problems from developing.
