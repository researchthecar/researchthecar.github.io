The 2021 Mazda CX-9 is a stylish and well-regarded three-row SUV known for its engaging driving dynamics and upscale interior. It comes with a single engine option: a turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 227 horsepower (on 87 octane fuel) or 250 horsepower (on 93 octane fuel) and 310 lb-ft of torque (on 87 octane fuel) or 320 lb-ft of torque (on 93 octane fuel). The only available transmission is a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the CX-9 for its sleek design, comfortable front seats, and responsive handling, but some criticize its relatively small third-row space and limited cargo capacity compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potentially engine knocking or damage if the oil level drops too low.
    *   Solution: Mazda released TSB R016/23 to address the oil consumption issue on some Mazda vehicles. This issue could be due to faulty valve stem seals, piston rings, or a PCV valve issue. Diagnosis would need to be performed to determine the root cause of the oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis $100 - $200+, PCV Valve Replacement $150 - $300, valve stem seal replacement $1,500-$3,000, piston ring replacement $3,000-$5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure. Symptoms may include a loss of power, unusual noises (whining, whistling) from the engine, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and/or a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit. Thoroughly inspect oil lines and ensure proper lubrication to the new turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted occasional rough or delayed shifting, especially during cold starts or when shifting between certain gears.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update (TCU reflash) can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, transmission valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: TCU reflash $100 - $200, valve body replacement $800 - $1500+, transmission replacement $3,500-$6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Rear Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear or failure of the rear shocks or struts, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, particularly over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected shocks or struts. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot, particularly the Mazda Connect system. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. Software updates may be available to address known bugs. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment system unit is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (if available) - minimal cost (dealership may charge), system replacement $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may intermittently fail to display an image, show a distorted or blurry image, or exhibit significant lag.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections. Software updates may be available. In some cases, the camera itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Check connections and software updates - minimal cost (dealership may charge), Camera replacement $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported various rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identification of the source of the noise and application of sound-deadening materials or tightening of loose components. This can be a labor-intensive process.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Mazda CX-9 generally exhibits reliability, but some owners have encountered issues related to engine oil consumption, turbocharger reliability, transmission shifting, suspension component wear, and electrical glitches. While some problems like infotainment system freezes can be minor annoyances, others such as turbocharger failure or engine oil consumption can be more severe and costly to repair. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect any used CX-9 before purchase.
