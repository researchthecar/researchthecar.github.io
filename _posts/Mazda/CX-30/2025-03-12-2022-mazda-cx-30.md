The 2022 Mazda CX-30 is a popular subcompact crossover known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. Engine options for the 2022 model year include a standard 2.5-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 186 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and an optional 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 delivering 227 hp (on 87 octane) or 250 hp (on 93 octane) and 310-320 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the CX-30's sporty handling, premium interior materials, and user-friendly technology. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space and a slightly firm ride.
