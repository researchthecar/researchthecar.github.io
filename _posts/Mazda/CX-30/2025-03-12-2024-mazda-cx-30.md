The 2024 Mazda CX-30 is a subcompact crossover known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. It's available with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 191 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-4 delivering 250 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque (on premium fuel).

Common dislikes include its relatively small rear seat space and cargo area compared to competitors, and the infotainment system's learning curve.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil after only a few thousand miles. This is not yet a widespread issue, but has been noted by a small percentage of owners.
    *   Solution: Closely monitor oil levels and document consumption. If excessive consumption is confirmed, the dealer may perform an oil consumption test. Potential fixes range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, or in more severe cases, engine replacement.

    *   Solution: The dealer may attempt a transmission control module (TCM) software update or perform a transmission adaptation reset. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $6,000+ (depending on the repair needed, if applicable.)
