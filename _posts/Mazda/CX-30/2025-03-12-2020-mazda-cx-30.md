The 2020 Mazda CX-30 is a subcompact crossover known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 186 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 227 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque on regular fuel (250 hp and 320 lb-ft on premium). Both engines were paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the CX-30's attractive styling, comfortable ride, and responsive handling. Common complaints include a smaller-than-average rear seat and cargo area compared to competitors, as well as some infotainment system quirks.
