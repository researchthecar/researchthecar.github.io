The 2014 Mazda 3 Sport is a compact car that offered a blend of sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and modern design. The 2014 Mazda 3 came standard with a 2.0-liter Skyactiv-G inline-4 engine producing 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 2.5-liter Skyactiv-G engine was also available, outputting 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Mazda 3's responsive steering, comfortable interior, and fuel economy. Common complaints include road noise, the infotainment system's complexity, and the availability of advanced safety features being limited to higher trim levels.

**Summary**

The 2014 Mazda 3 Sport is a generally reliable car, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as engine mount failures, transmission problems (especially with the automatic), and electrical glitches. Rust can also be a concern in areas with harsh winters. The severity and cost of repairs vary depending on the issue, but some repairs like transmission work can be quite expensive. While the 2.0L Skyactiv-G Engine is prone to issues with the engine mounts, the 2.5L engine is more prone to issues with the VVT. Overall the engine is reliable, but the transmission can be a pain point.
