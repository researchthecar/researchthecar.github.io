The 2023 Mazda 3 Sport is a compact car known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. The "Sport" trim is essentially the base model. While it offers a spirited driving experience, it's often considered less powerful than the higher trim levels with the more powerful 2.5L turbo engine option. The base engine option is a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 191 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with either a six-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual transmission (though the manual is less common, especially on the base trim). Owners generally praise the Mazda 3 for its handling, comfortable interior, and attractive styling. Common complaints include the limited rear seat space, road noise, and the somewhat basic features on the Sport trim.

**Summary**

The 2023 Mazda 3 Sport generally receives positive reviews, but like any vehicle, it has potential issues to be aware of. The most concerning issues appear to be the potential for engine oil consumption, rough shifting with the automatic transmission, and electrical glitches in the infotainment system. While the other issues are less severe, they can still be frustrating. The cost to fix these issues can range from minor expenses to significant repairs, particularly if engine or transmission work is required. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, especially the infotainment system, during a test drive and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
