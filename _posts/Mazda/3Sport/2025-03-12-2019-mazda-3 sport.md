Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Mazda 3 Sport, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration.  This information is based on owner reports, forum discussions, and repair data.

The 2019 Mazda 3 marked the beginning of the fourth generation and introduced a sleek new design and more premium feel. The "Sport" designation usually refers to the hatchback body style.  The standard engine for the 2019 Mazda 3 was a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 186 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission (though the manual was less common).  While people generally praise the Mazda 3 for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system, road noise, and visibility limitations caused by the thick C-pillars of the hatchback.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potentially engine knocking if the oil level gets too low.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and topping off as needed. In more severe cases, a dealer inspection might be required to check for leaks or internal engine issues such as piston ring problems. Some owners have reported the dealer performing an oil consumption test to diagnose the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (topping off oil) to potentially $1,000+ (if major engine work is required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Rattling Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a rattling noise coming from the engine, particularly on cold starts or during acceleration. This may be related to the variable valve timing (VVT) system or the timing chain.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is recommended to pinpoint the source of the noise. Repairs might involve replacing the VVT actuator, timing chain, or related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears.  Hesitation when accelerating from a stop has also been reported.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with a transmission control module (TCM) software update or a transmission fluid flush. In more severe cases, valve body issues within the transmission may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) to $800+ (valve body repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This may be related to the rear dampers (shock absorbers) or the suspension bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn or damaged rear dampers or suspension bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system can be prone to freezing, crashing, or becoming unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: Trying a system reset (holding down the volume knob and other buttons). Software updates from the dealer may also address this issue. In some cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) to $500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain and difficulty starting the vehicle, especially if it sits for a few days without being driven.
    * Solution: Test the battery and charging system.  Look for parasitic drains (something drawing power when the car is off). Possible causes include a faulty door switch, a malfunctioning module, or aftermarket accessories.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (battery replacement) to $200+ (diagnosing and fixing parasitic drain)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False activation of the Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system, where the car brakes unexpectedly even when there is no obstacle in front.
    *   Solution: Dealership inspection and recalibration of the AEB system. In some cases, a sensor replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if covered under warranty) to $300+ (sensor replacement)
    * Recalls:
        *   **Recall Number:** 22V-877
            *   Description: Recall regarding the Smart Brake Support (SBS) system due to potential for incorrect object detection, which could cause unexpected braking.
            *   Solution: Dealers will update the SBS software, free of charge.

**Interior**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Various rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the noise and secure the loose trim pieces. This may involve adding felt tape or using other methods to dampen the vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY) to $100+ (if a professional is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Mazda 3 Sport is generally a reliable vehicle but it's not without its potential issues.  The most common complaints center around the infotainment system and occasional engine/transmission quirks. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences like infotainment glitches and noises, to more serious problems like excessive oil consumption requiring potential engine repairs. Costs to fix vary significantly depending on the specific issue. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect any used 2019 Mazda 3 before purchasing.
