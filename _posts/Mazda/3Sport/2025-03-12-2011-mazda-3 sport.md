**Summary**

The 2011 Mazda 3 Sport is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners have reported issues ranging from minor electrical glitches to more significant engine and transmission problems. The most concerning issues include potential oil consumption with the 2.5L engine and transmission shifting problems. While some issues, like TPMS sensor failures and sway bar bushing wear, are relatively inexpensive to address, engine or transmission repairs can be costly. The dashboard cracking issue is mostly cosmetic, but it can affect the car's overall appearance. The rear wheel arch rust is a concern for those living in harsher climates. Overall, pre-purchase inspection, particularly focusing on engine health and transmission smoothness, is advisable.
