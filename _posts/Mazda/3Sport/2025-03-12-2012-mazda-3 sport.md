**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (155 hp)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil frequently between oil changes. This can be noticed by a low oil level warning light or visibly low oil level on the dipstick.
    * Solution: The solution can range from using a heavier-weight oil, replacing valve stem seals, or, in severe cases, replacing the piston rings or engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+

* **Purge Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The purge valve, a component of the evaporative emissions control system (EVAP), can fail, leading to a check engine light (CEL) and potential issues with engine idling or starting. The car might stall or have a rough idle, especially after refueling.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty purge valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200

    * Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Electrical**

* **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors can fail, causing the TPMS warning light to illuminate on the dashboard, even if the tire pressure is correct.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per sensor

* **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
