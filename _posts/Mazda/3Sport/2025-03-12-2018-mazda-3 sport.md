The 2018 Mazda 3 Sport is a compact car praised for its sporty handling, stylish design, and upscale interior. The "Sport" designation typically refers to trim levels with the 2.5L engine, though this can vary by market. A key selling point is its engaging driving experience and fuel efficiency. Common complaints include a somewhat cramped rear seat, road noise, and infotainment system quirks. The 2018 Mazda 3 offered two primary engine choices in the North American market: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing approximately 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter inline-4 generating about 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The following information focuses on the 2.5L engine with the 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.5L Skyactiv-G I4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure warning light illuminating, or noticing the oil level is low on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels more frequently and topping off as needed can mitigate the immediate issue. Some owners have had success by switching to a higher-viscosity oil. If the issue is severe, an engine inspection may be required to check for leaks, piston ring wear, or valve seal issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (topping off oil) - $200 (oil change with synthetic) - $1000+ (Engine repair, depending on the severity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Mount Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration, especially at idle or low speeds. Clunking noises from the engine bay during acceleration or deceleration. These symptoms suggest worn or damaged engine mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn or damaged engine mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 (depending on which mount(s) need replacement and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Skyactiv-Drive)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported occasional harsh shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds or during downshifts. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or when attempting to pass another vehicle has also been noted.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, a transmission flush or even a replacement of valve body components could be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software update if covered under warranty) - $200 (Transmission flush) - $800+ (Valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven road surfaces. This is often attributed to worn or loose sway bar end links or bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn sway bar end links or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or updating the infotainment system software to the latest version may resolve the issue. In some cases, a faulty head unit may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software update) - $100 - $200 (diagnostics at repair shop) - $500+ (Head unit replacement, if not covered under warranty)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or requiring a jump start. Parasitic drain from an electrical component or system that is not fully shutting down when the vehicle is off is a common cause.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic drain and repair or replace the faulty component. This could involve testing various modules and circuits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (Diagnostics) - $100+ (depending on the part that needs to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or creaking noises coming from the sunroof, especially when driving over uneven road surfaces. This may be due to loose or misaligned components within the sunroof assembly.
    *   Solution: Inspection and adjustment of the sunroof mechanism. Lubricating moving parts can also help to reduce noise. In some cases, replacement of worn components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (adjustment and lubrication) - $300+ (component replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Mazda 3 Sport with the 2.5L engine and automatic transmission generally offers a reliable driving experience, but some owners have reported issues related to oil consumption, transmission harshness, infotainment system glitches, and suspension noises. The severity of these issues can vary, and some may be easily addressed with software updates or minor repairs. However, more extensive repairs, such as engine work or transmission component replacement, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing, paying close attention to oil consumption, transmission performance, and the functionality of the infotainment system.
