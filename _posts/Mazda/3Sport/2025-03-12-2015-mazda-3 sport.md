The 2015 Mazda 3 Sport is a compact car known for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and attractive design. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque and a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that delivered 184 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Mazda 3's responsive steering, comfortable interior, and good gas mileage. Common complaints include a sometimes-stiff ride, road noise, and a cramped rear seat.
