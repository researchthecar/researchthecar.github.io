Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2020 Mazda 3 Sport, focusing on accurate and specific information as requested.

The 2020 Mazda 3 Sport is a compact car lauded for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. However, like any vehicle, it's not without its potential problems. The 2020 Mazda 3 Sport primarily comes with a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine, producing 186 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque. The car is available with either a six-speed automatic transmission or, in some trims, a six-speed manual. Owners often praise the Mazda 3 for its sporty handling and premium feel, but some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system, road noise, and visibility.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Direct Injection Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, carbon deposits can accumulate on the intake valves due to the direct injection system. This can lead to rough idling, reduced fuel economy, and decreased performance.
    *   Solution: A professional intake valve cleaning service (e.g., walnut blasting) can remove the carbon buildup. Using high-quality fuel with detergents can help prevent future buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. A transmission fluid flush may also help. In more severe cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150+ for fluid flush, $100 - $500+ for software update, $500 - $2000+ for valve body replacement.

**6-Speed Manual**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mazda Connect infotainment system can sometimes freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate controls.
    *   Solution: Ensure the infotainment system software is up to date. A hard reset of the system may provide a temporary fix. If the issue persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1000+ (Infotainment Unit Replacement)

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report the battery draining overnight or over a couple of days. This is often linked to modules not fully shutting down when the vehicle is off.
    * Solution: TSB R012/22 addresses an issue where the Rear View Camera (RVC) module may not go to sleep mode when the ignition is switched off. Reprogramming the Rear View Camera (RVC) control module with the latest software will solve the problem.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the AEB system activating unnecessarily, even when there are no obstacles in front of the vehicle. This can be startling and potentially dangerous.
    *   Solution: The forward-sensing camera or radar system may need to be recalibrated or replaced. Ensure the front Mazda emblem and surrounding area are clean and free of obstructions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for recalibration, $500 - $1500+ for sensor replacement.

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported various rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear hatch area. These noises can be intermittent and difficult to pinpoint.
    *   Solution: The source of the rattle needs to be identified and addressed. This may involve tightening loose trim pieces, adding sound deadening material, or replacing faulty clips or fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the source and complexity.

**Summary**

The 2020 Mazda 3 Sport is a well-regarded vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the issues reported by owners. The electrical system, particularly the infotainment system and AEB can have some issues. Engine carbon buildup is possible with any direct-injection engine. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others can be more costly, especially if they involve replacing electronic components or performing extensive engine work. Overall, the issues are not widespread, but they are worth considering before making a purchase.
