The 2010 Mazda 3 Sport is a compact car known for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and attractive design. The Mazda 3 Sport came with a couple of different engine options. One option is a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing approximately 148 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque. Another engine option is a 2.5L inline-4 engine producing approximately 167 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Mazda 3's responsive steering and nimble feel. Some common complaints include road noise, and some reliability issues, especially in older models.

In summary, the 2010 Mazda 3 Sport, while praised for its driving dynamics, can experience several issues related to its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical systems, and body. While some issues like engine mount failure and TPMS sensor issues are relatively inexpensive to address, problems such as transmission issues and rust repair can be more costly and impact the long-term ownership experience. It's important to have a pre-purchase inspection done to identify potential problems before buying a used 2010 Mazda 3 Sport.
