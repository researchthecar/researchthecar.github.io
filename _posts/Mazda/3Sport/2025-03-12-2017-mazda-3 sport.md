The 2017 Mazda 3 Sport is a popular compact car known for its sporty handling, stylish design, and fuel efficiency. The Sport trim typically comes with a 2.0-liter Skyactiv-G inline-4 engine producing around 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. While the 2.5-liter engine is available on higher trims, the Sport trim came with the 2.0-liter engine. Both a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic transmission were available. Owners often praise its driving dynamics, upscale interior for its class, and good fuel economy. Common complaints include a somewhat noisy cabin, particularly on the highway, and the infotainment system can feel dated compared to newer competitors.
