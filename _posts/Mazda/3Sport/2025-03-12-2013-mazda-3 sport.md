The 2013 Mazda 3 Sport is a popular compact car known for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and stylish design. The "Sport" designation typically refers to the hatchback body style. Available engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing around 155 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.5-liter inline-4 engine. Transmission choices consist of a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally praise the Mazda 3 for its engaging driving experience and responsive steering. Some common complaints revolve around road noise, a relatively small back seat, and the infotainment system's dated interface.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be noticeable by blue smoke from the exhaust and a low oil level warning light.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels frequently and use the manufacturer's recommended oil type and viscosity. In some cases, a dealer may perform an oil consumption test and potentially replace piston rings or other engine components if the consumption is excessive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Purge Control Solenoid Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The purge control solenoid valve (part of the evaporative emission control system) can fail, causing a check engine light and potentially rough idling or difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replace the purge control solenoid valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or delayed shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can manifest as jerky shifts or hesitation when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Start by performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change using the correct Mazda-specified fluid. In more severe cases, valve body issues or internal component wear may require a more extensive repair or a transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush); $800 - $3,000+ (transmission repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This can be caused by worn sway bar links, bushings, or shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension components, such as sway bar links, bushings, and shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, causing the car to be difficult or impossible to start, especially after sitting for a few days. This could be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and eliminate the parasitic draw. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories (alarms, stereos) and faulty electrical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the diagnosis)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensor may fail causing the TPMS light to illuminate on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed TPMS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners in areas with heavy road salt use have reported rust developing on the rear wheel arches.
    *   Solution: Treat the rust and apply a protective coating. In severe cases, body panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors can become loose and sag over time, obstructing the driver's view.
    *   Solution: Replace the sun visor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Mazda 3 Sport is a generally reliable vehicle, but like all cars, it has its share of potential issues. The most commonly reported issues relate to engine oil consumption, transmission shifting, suspension noise, and electrical problems. While some issues like the sun visor are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others like excessive oil consumption can be more costly. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any unusual symptoms can help prevent more serious problems. Overall, the severity and cost of the common issues are moderate.
