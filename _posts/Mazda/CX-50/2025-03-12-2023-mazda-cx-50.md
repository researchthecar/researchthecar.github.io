The 2023 Mazda CX-50 is a compact crossover SUV praised for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and upscale interior. It's available with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine delivering 256 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque (on premium fuel). Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the CX-50's comfortable ride, responsive handling, and user-friendly infotainment system. Some common dislikes include the rear seat legroom, which can be tight for taller passengers, and the relatively small cargo area compared to some competitors.
