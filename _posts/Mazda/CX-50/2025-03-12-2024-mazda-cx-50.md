The 2024 Mazda CX-50 is a compact crossover SUV known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and off-road capability. It comes with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder delivering 256 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque (on premium fuel). Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the CX-50 for its attractive styling, comfortable interior, and enjoyable driving experience. Common complaints include infotainment system usability, fuel economy (especially with the turbo engine), and some concerns about rear seat space.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, noticeable shaking of the vehicle, check engine light illuminating, decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the root cause, which could involve faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors. Replacement of the identified failed component is typically the fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the failed component and the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warning light illuminating, the need to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes, bluish smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of oil consumption (worn piston rings, valve stem seals, turbocharger issues). Repair or replacement of the affected components. In some cases, Mazda may perform an oil consumption test and potentially replace the engine under warranty if consumption exceeds acceptable limits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $7000+ depending on the root cause and repair needed.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation or delay when shifting gears, particularly when downshifting.
    *   Solution: First step is to check the transmission fluid level and condition. If low or contaminated, a fluid flush and fill may resolve the issue. Further diagnosis of valve body issues, or worn clutches may require transmission repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $5000+ (transmission replacement).
