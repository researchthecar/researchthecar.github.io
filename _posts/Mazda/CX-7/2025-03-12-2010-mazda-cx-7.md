The 2010 Mazda CX-7 is a compact crossover SUV that offered a blend of sporty handling and practicality. For the 2010 model year, it was available with two engine options: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 161 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.3-liter turbocharged inline-4 generating 244 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.3L turbo came with a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the CX-7's responsive steering and relatively nimble handling for its class, as well as its stylish design. However, fuel economy, particularly with the turbocharged engine, and some reliability concerns were frequently cited as drawbacks.
