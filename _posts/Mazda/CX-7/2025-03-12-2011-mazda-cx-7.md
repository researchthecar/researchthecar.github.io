The 2011 Mazda CX-7 is a compact crossover SUV that offers a sporty driving experience and stylish design. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 161 hp and 161 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.3L turbocharged inline-4 producing 244 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.3L turbo engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
