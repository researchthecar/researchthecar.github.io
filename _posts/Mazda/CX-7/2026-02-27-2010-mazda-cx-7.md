### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mazda CX-7, particularly models equipped with the 2.3L turbocharged engine, can be prone to issues related to the turbocharger, oil consumption, and PCV system. The automatic transmissions, especially the 5-speed FWD variant, may exhibit harsh shifting. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also noted areas for potential wear. Electrical gremlins such as power window motors and infotainment glitches can occur. Exterior rust, particularly on the rear wheel arches, is a concern in certain climates. Interior issues like HVAC blower motor failure and clogged sunroof drains are also reported. Despite these points, many CX-7s provide reliable service when properly maintained, with the 2.5L naturally aspirated engine and 6-speed automatic transmission generally being more trouble-free.
