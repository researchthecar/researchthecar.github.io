### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mazda CX-7, particularly models equipped with the 2.3L turbocharged engine, can be prone to specific issues such as turbocharger problems and oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmissions, especially the 5-speed, may exhibit shifting problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also noted for wear. Electrical issues, including power window motors and infotainment glitches, can occur. Exterior rust and interior HVAC blower motor failures are other potential concerns.
