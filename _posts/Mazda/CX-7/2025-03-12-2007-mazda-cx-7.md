**Summary**

The 2007 Mazda CX-7, while praised for its sporty driving dynamics and design, suffers from a few common issues. The most significant are related to the engine, particularly the turbocharger and timing chain, which can be expensive to repair. Excessive oil consumption is another prevalent concern. Transmission issues are also reported. Rust is also an issue. While some repairs are relatively minor, the potential for major engine and transmission work means potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and budget accordingly.
