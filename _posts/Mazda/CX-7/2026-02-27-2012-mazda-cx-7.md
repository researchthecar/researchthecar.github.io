### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mazda CX-7, particularly models equipped with the 2.3L turbocharged engine, exhibits some common reliability concerns. These primarily revolve around the turbocharger's longevity and potential oil consumption issues. The automatic transmissions, especially the 6-speed, can also be a point of concern regarding overheating and fluid degradation. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also noted for wear. Electrical issues, often stemming from the Body Control Module, can lead to various intermittent problems. Exterior rust on the rear wheel arches and interior wear on the driver's seat are also reported. While the 2.5L naturally aspirated engine appears more robust, potential buyers and owners should be aware of these specific areas to budget for and proactively maintain.
