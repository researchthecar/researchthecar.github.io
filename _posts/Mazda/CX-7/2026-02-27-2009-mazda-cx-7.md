### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mazda CX-7, particularly models equipped with the 2.3L turbocharged engine, can be a fun and capable crossover. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as turbocharger problems, increased oil consumption, and potential transmission concerns, especially with the automatic transmissions. The 2.5L naturally aspirated engine and the standard chassis generally present fewer significant mechanical worries. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are also noted. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, diligent maintenance and awareness of these specific problem areas are recommended for long-term ownership.
