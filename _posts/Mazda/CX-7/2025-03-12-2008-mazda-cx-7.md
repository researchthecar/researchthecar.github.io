The 2008 Mazda CX-7 is a compact crossover SUV that offers sporty handling and a stylish design. The CX-7 came standard with a turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-4 engine producing 244 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A naturally aspirated 2.5-liter inline-4 engine (161 hp and 161 lb-ft of torque) was also available, but only on later model years and not on the 2008 model.
