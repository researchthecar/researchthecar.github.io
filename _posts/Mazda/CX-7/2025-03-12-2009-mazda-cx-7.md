The 2009 Mazda CX-7 is a compact crossover SUV that offered sporty handling and distinctive styling. The standard engine was a 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 244 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A non-turbo 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine option producing 161 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque became available mid-year. The 2.3L turbo engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.5L engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the CX-7's sharp steering and responsive engine (especially the turbo model), but some disliked the turbo engine's fuel economy and potential reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.3L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, whistling noises, and potentially engine damage due to oil starvation. This is frequently caused by oil coking due to heat and poor oil maintenance habits.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. It is also recommended to clean or replace the oil feed lines. Strict adherence to regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil is critical for prevention.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+

**Summary**

The 2009 Mazda CX-7 presents a mixed bag for potential buyers. While it offers sporty handling and attractive styling, it's crucial to be aware of potential engine issues with the turbocharged 2.3L variant, particularly turbocharger and timing chain problems, which can be expensive to repair. Suspension and electrical issues are also common, but generally less severe. Overall, pre-purchase inspection is critical, especially regarding oil maintenance history for the 2.3L turbo engine. Due to the age of the vehicle, repairs may be more frequent and finding parts may be more challenging, potentially increasing the overall cost of ownership.
