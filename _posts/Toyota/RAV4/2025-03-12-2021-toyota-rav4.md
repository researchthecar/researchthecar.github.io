The 2021 Toyota RAV4 is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. The standard engine is a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The RAV4 is generally praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong resale value. However, some owners have reported issues with various components. Potential downsides include the somewhat noisy engine at higher RPMs and the infotainment system, which some find less intuitive compared to competitors.
