**Summary**

The 2017 Toyota RAV4 is generally a reliable vehicle, but like all vehicles, it has some common issues. The most concerning issues relate to the engine (excessive oil consumption, inverter failure in hybrid models) and transmission (harsh shifting), as these can be expensive to repair. Electrical issues with the Entune system and backup camera can be annoying but are typically less costly to address. Suspension noise and automatic liftgate malfunctions are other areas to be aware of. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used RAV4 before purchasing, paying close attention to the engine's oil level and transmission performance.
