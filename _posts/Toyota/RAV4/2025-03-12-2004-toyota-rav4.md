The 2004 Toyota RAV4 is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. Available with either a 2.0L inline-4 engine (148 hp, 142 lb-ft of torque) or a 2.4L inline-4 engine (161 hp, 162 lb-ft of torque), both engines were paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the RAV4 for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and Toyota's reputation for longevity. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated styling and the lack of more modern features found in newer SUVs.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Burning oil at a higher-than-normal rate, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings may resolve the issue. A more comprehensive solution might involve replacing the entire engine, especially if the problem is severe or has caused further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $5000+

*   **Failed Pre-Catalytic Converter**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light comes on, often with codes P0420 (Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold). The pre-catalytic converter (located close to the engine) can fail, causing reduced engine performance and potentially damaging other emissions components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the pre-catalytic converter. Some owners opt to replace the main catalytic converter as well, as a failing pre-cat can sometimes damage the main cat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak around the valve cover area, potentially dripping onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

*   **Broken Motor Mounts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration and clunking from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken motor mount.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**2.0L Inline-4**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky gear changes, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Sometimes a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement can improve shifting. However, more severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (fluid flush), $2000 - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at low speeds or during acceleration. Can also cause stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

**5-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll. May also hear clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ (for all four)

*   **Broken Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower on one side, and can hear a metallic clanking noise.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ (for two)

*   **Worn Out Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking from the suspension. Vehicle pulls to one side when braking or accelerating.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per arm)

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Power Window Motors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows operate intermittently or fail to operate at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window

*   **Check Engine Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminating for various reasons, including emissions issues, sensor failures, or catalytic converter problems. Requires diagnostic scanning to determine the root cause.
    *   Solution: Depends on the cause; could involve replacing sensors, repairing wiring, or addressing other mechanical issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the problem.

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, difficulty starting, or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty alternator.

**Summary**

The 2004 Toyota RAV4 is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it's prone to certain issues. The most concerning issues revolve around the 2.4L engine, with reports of excessive oil consumption and catalytic converter failures. Electrical problems and suspension wear are also common. While the 4-speed automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting, manual transmissions are typically trouble-free. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can help prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's overall reliability. It's crucial to inspect the vehicle thoroughly, especially for rust and signs of engine issues, before purchasing.
