The 2012 Toyota RAV4 is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. It came with two engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 179 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5-liter V6 engine with 269 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the RAV4's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. However, some common complaints include road noise and less-than-thrilling handling.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.5L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored. The symptoms often include the need to add oil frequently between scheduled oil changes and, in some cases, visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: A TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) was released addressing oil consumption issues in some Toyota engines, which may involve replacing the piston rings or short block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 Cylinder**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting, hesitation, or slipping during gear changes. This can manifest as rough transitions between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and replacement can resolve the issue. However, more severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300 for fluid flush; $800 - $1,500 for valve body replacement; $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported sagging in the rear suspension, particularly when carrying heavier loads or passengers. This can lead to a decrease in ride height, reduced handling performance, and increased wear on the rear tires.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear springs and shocks with new or upgraded components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door lock actuators can fail, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking electronically. This often occurs intermittently at first before becoming a permanent issue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door, depending on the actuator and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of cracking on the dashboard, particularly in sun-exposed areas. This is primarily a cosmetic issue but can detract from the vehicle's overall appearance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$1500+ for dashboard replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2012 Toyota RAV4 generally holds up well, but some common issues to be aware of are the 2.5L engine's potential for excessive oil consumption, occasional transmission issues (slipping or harsh shifting), power door lock actuator failure, suspension sagging, and dashboard cracking. The severity of these issues can vary, but the potential cost of repairs, particularly for engine or transmission work, can be significant. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle for these issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
