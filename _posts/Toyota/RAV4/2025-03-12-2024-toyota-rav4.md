The 2024 Toyota RAV4 is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It's offered with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine (203 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque), a hybrid powertrain combining the 2.5-liter engine with electric motors, and a plug-in hybrid (RAV4 Prime) option for even greater efficiency and electric range. The standard RAV4 is appreciated for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and comprehensive suite of safety features. However, some owners have reported issues with the infotainment system, specifically regarding connectivity and responsiveness, while others find the engine to be somewhat noisy and underpowered during acceleration.
