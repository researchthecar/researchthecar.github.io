**Summary**
The 2015 Toyota RAV4 is generally a reliable vehicle, but it is not immune to certain issues. Some owners have reported problems with engine oil consumption, battery failure, and timing chain failure. Transmission issues, such as hard shifting, have also been reported. Electrical problems, including faulty navigation systems and power window failures, are also present. Additionally, rust on the rear liftgate, climate control issues, rear suspension noise, and interior problems have been documented. While many of these issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, some, such as engine and transmission failures, can be costly and time-consuming to resolve. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and consider extended warranty coverage or regular maintenance to minimize repair expenses.
