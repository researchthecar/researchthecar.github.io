**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some 2.4L engines may develop excessive oil consumption, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored. Symptoms include the need to add oil frequently between oil changes and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings may address the issue. Other solutions include using heavier weight oil.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

* **VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning VVT-i system can cause rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the VVT-i actuator or solenoid valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 (Introduced in 2006, so rare for the 2005 model year - listing for completeness)**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various seals and gaskets on the V6 engine as it ages, leading to oil loss and potential engine damage. Common leak points include the valve cover gaskets, timing cover, and oil pan gasket.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking seals and gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the leak's location and complexity.
