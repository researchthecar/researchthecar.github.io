The 2008 Toyota RAV4 is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability and practicality. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 166 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 generating 269 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission on the I4 Models, and a 5-speed automatic transmission on the V6 Models. Owners generally appreciate the RAV4 for its fuel efficiency (especially with the I4), comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling and the lack of some advanced features compared to newer models.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. The amount of oil consumed varies.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can help reduce oil consumption, although this is a major repair.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. A diagnostic scan can pinpoint the specific cylinder(s) affected.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the number of components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**

**Summary**

The 2008 Toyota RAV4 is generally a reliable vehicle, but some common issues exist. The 2.4L engine can suffer from excessive oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. Both engine options can be subject to various leaks that require maintenance. Electrical issues such as power door lock actuator failures are also relatively common. The dashboard is also prone to cracking in warm climates. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues range from minor inconveniences to more significant repairs, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2008 RAV4.
