The 2011 Toyota RAV4 is a compact SUV known for its reliability and practicality. It came with two engine options: a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 179 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 producing 269 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the RAV4's spacious interior, fuel efficiency (especially with the 4-cylinder), and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include the dated 4-speed automatic transmission and somewhat bland styling.
