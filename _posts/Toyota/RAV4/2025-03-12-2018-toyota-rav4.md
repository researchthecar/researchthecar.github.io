The 2018 Toyota RAV4 is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. The most common engine option is a 2.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 176 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. While owners appreciate its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong resale value, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's responsiveness and the engine's somewhat underwhelming acceleration. A hybrid version was also available, but this report will focus on the non-hybrid engine/transmission option.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil light illuminating or noticing the oil level significantly lower than expected when checking the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels frequently and topping off as needed. In severe cases, a dealer may perform an oil consumption test and potentially replace piston rings or other internal engine components if the consumption exceeds Toyota's acceptable threshold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of repairs required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine may experience misfires leading to rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic codes related to misfires (e.g., P0300, P0301, P0302, etc.) may be present.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the misfire (ignition coils, spark plugs, fuel injectors, etc.) and replacing the faulty components.

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. This may be more noticeable between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with software updates or transmission fluid changes. In more severe cases, valve body or transmission replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises emanating from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven road surfaces.
