The 2023 Toyota RAV4 is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It comes with either a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, a hybrid powertrain, or a plug-in hybrid powertrain. Owners often praise the RAV4's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and comprehensive suite of standard safety features. However, some common criticisms include the sometimes-sluggish acceleration of the base engine, the road noise at higher speeds, and the infotainment system's user interface.
