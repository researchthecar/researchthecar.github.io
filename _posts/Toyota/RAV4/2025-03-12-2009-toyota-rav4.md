The 2009 Toyota RAV4 is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability and practicality. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 179 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 269 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 4-speed automatic transmission on the 4-cylinder models, and a 5-speed automatic transmission on the V6 models. Owners often praise the RAV4 for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and good fuel economy (especially with the 4-cylinder). Common complaints include a somewhat dated interior design and some reported issues with oil consumption in certain engine configurations.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Toyota has performed piston ring replacements under warranty or extended service campaigns (though these are likely expired now). A thorough inspection to check for leaks or other causes is necessary. An oil consumption test should be performed to determine the extent of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ depending on the severity and repair needed. Could be significantly higher if a new engine is required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (with 2.5L Inline-4)**

No Issues Found

**5-Speed Automatic (with 3.5L V6)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush; $800 - $1500+ for valve body replacement; $2,500 - $4,000+ for transmission rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn sway bar bushings and/or end links. Shocks/struts might also be a cause if worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on what parts are replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks failing to function properly, either intermittently or completely. Often affects individual doors.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) light illuminates despite proper tire pressure.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty TPMS sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per sensor (including installation).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Hatch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing around the license plate light area or the bottom edge of the rear hatch.
    *   Solution: Repair and repaint the affected area. In severe cases, the entire hatch may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the severity and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sun visors become loose and no longer stay in the upright position.
    *   Solution: Replace the sun visor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per visor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Toyota RAV4 generally holds up well, but potential buyers should be aware of the possibility of excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L inline-4 engine, and rough shifting in the 5-speed automatic transmission found in the V6 models. Suspension noises and electrical issues such as door lock actuator failures are also relatively common. While most of these issues are not catastrophic, they can lead to unexpected repair costs. The severity and cost to repair these issues varies depending on the specific problem and the repair required, so a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
