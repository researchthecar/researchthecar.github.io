The 2016 Toyota RAV4 is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. The standard engine is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 176 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. It also offered a hybrid option with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired with an electric motor and a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

However, some common complaints include the infotainment system's user interface, road noise, and the base engine's acceleration being somewhat lackluster for some drivers.
