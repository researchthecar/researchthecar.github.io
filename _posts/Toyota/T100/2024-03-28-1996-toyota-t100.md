* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to skip or break. Symptoms include engine noise, reduced power, or no start. The repair involves replacing the timing chain tensioner and possibly the timing chains and gears. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include overheating, coolant leaks, and loss of power. The repair involves removing the intake manifold and replacing the gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

**4.0L V6**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Similar to the 3.4L V6, the intake manifold gasket can fail, causing similar symptoms. The repair involves the same procedure as for the 3.4L V6. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
* **Knock sensor failure:** The knock sensor can fail, causing the engine to run poorly and/or misfire. Symptoms include engine knocking, reduced power, and increased emissions. The repair involves replacing the knock sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
* **Fuel pump failure:** The fuel pump can fail, causing the engine to stall or not start. Symptoms include fuel starvation, engine hesitation, and no start. The repair involves replacing the fuel pump. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

**Transmission**

**5-speed manual**

* **Transmission fluid leaks:** Leaks can occur from the input shaft seal, output shaft seal, or other seals. Symptoms include fluid leaks on the ground or low transmission fluid levels. The repair involves replacing the faulty seals. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**4-speed automatic**

* **Transmission slippage:** The transmission may slip out of gear or hesitate to shift. Symptoms include loss of power, erratic shifting, and increased transmission noise. The repair may involve replacing the transmission filter and fluid, adjusting the bands, or rebuilding the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $3000+
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing loss of power, shuddering, or no movement. The repair involves replacing the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
