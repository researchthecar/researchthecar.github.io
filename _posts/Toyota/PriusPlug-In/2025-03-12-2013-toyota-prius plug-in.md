The 2013 Toyota Prius Plug-In is a hybrid vehicle that combines a gasoline engine with an electric motor and a larger battery pack than the standard Prius, allowing for limited all-electric driving. It features a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 98 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque, paired with an electric motor for a combined output of 134 horsepower. The vehicle uses an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). Owners often appreciate the Prius Plug-In for its fuel efficiency, ability to drive short distances on electric power alone, and overall reliability. However, some common complaints include limited all-electric range, relatively slow acceleration, and the higher initial cost compared to the standard Prius.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**
* **Inverter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The hybrid system warning light illuminates, loss of power, and in some cases, the vehicle may not start or drive. This is often due to overheating or component failure within the inverter.
    * Solution: Replacement of the inverter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+

**Battery**

**Battery Pack**
* **Reduced Electric Range**
    * Description/Symptoms: The all-electric range gradually decreases over time due to battery degradation. The vehicle switches to hybrid mode sooner than expected.
    * Solution: Replacement of the battery pack or individual battery modules.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $8,000+

* **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Fault codes related to the BMS, inaccurate state of charge readings, and potential charging problems.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of the BMS components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

* **Charging System Faults**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty charging, error messages during charging, or the car failing to recognize the charger.
    * Solution: Could involve replacing the charging port, onboard charger, or related wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+

**ECVT Transmission**

**ECVT Transmission**
* **Inverter Coolant Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating of the inverter, leading to hybrid system malfunction. The warning light turns on, and the engine may cut off to avoid any further damage to the system.
    * Solution: Replacement of the inverter coolant pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Electrical**

* **Combination Meter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The combination meter (instrument cluster) may fail, causing the speedometer, fuel gauge, and other displays to stop working.
    * Solution: Replacement of the combination meter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **12V Auxiliary Battery Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery, responsible for starting the car and powering accessories, can fail prematurely, leading to starting issues or electrical malfunctions.
    * Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Headlight Malfunction**
   * Description/Symptoms: The headlights may flicker or stop working. Often associated with the ballast or bulb.
   * Solution: Replacement of the affected headlight component.
   * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
* **HVAC Fan Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The HVAC fan motor stops working or makes excessive noise, leading to poor climate control.
    * Solution: Replacement of the fan motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*No Issues Found*

**Summary**
The 2013 Toyota Prius Plug-In can be a reliable and fuel-efficient vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of potential issues, including those with the electric motor, hybrid battery, and inverter. The high cost of replacing the battery pack or inverter could be a significant expense. Electrical issues and interior component failures are also possibilities. Addressing these concerns proactively through thorough inspections and maintenance can help mitigate potential problems.
