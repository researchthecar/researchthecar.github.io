The 2012 Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid is a variant of the popular Prius, offering extended electric-only range for enhanced fuel efficiency. It features a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine producing 98 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque, paired with an electric motor for a combined system output of 134 horsepower. All Prius models use a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Prius Plug-In for its exceptional fuel economy and reliability, while some find the acceleration and handling to be less engaging than traditional gasoline vehicles. Common complaints include the infotainment system, and the reduced cargo space due to the larger battery pack.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**
*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the high-voltage battery pack may degrade, leading to reduced electric-only range and overall performance. This may manifest as shorter distances driven on a single charge and increased reliance on the gasoline engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hybrid battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inverter, which converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the electric motor, can fail. Symptoms include warning lights on the dashboard, loss of power, and the vehicle may not start or drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the inverter assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**1.8L 4-Cylinder (2ZR-FXE)**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption. This is often noticed by needing to add oil between scheduled oil changes.
    * Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings or the entire engine may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Carbon buildup in the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can cause it to stick open or closed. This can lead to rough idling, poor acceleration, and potentially trigger the check engine light.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be caused by issues within the CVT's internal components or the electronic control system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT fluid may alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure, rendering the vehicle inoperable.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Combination Meter (Dashboard Display) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The combination meter, which displays speed, fuel level, and other critical information, can fail. Symptoms include a blank or flickering display, or inaccurate readings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the combination meter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Headlight Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the headlights, including premature bulb failure or dim lighting. This can be caused by faulty wiring, corroded connectors, or failing headlight assemblies.
    * Solution: Replacing bulbs, cleaning connectors, or replacing the entire headlight assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the windshield is prone to cracking, even from small impacts. This may be due to the windshield's design or the angle at which it is mounted.
    *   Solution: Replacing the windshield.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system may freeze, display inaccurate information, or fail to boot up. This can be caused by software glitches or hardware failures within the system.
    *   Solution: Updating the navigation system software or replacing the navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid, while generally reliable, does have some common issues owners have reported. The most significant concerns are related to the hybrid battery degradation and potential inverter failures in the electric motor, which can be costly to repair. The engine may experience oil consumption and EGR Valve issues. Owners should also be aware of potential problems with the CVT, electrical components such as the combination meter, and the windshield's susceptibility to cracking. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, making it essential to have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase.
