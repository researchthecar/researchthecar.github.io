The 2011 Toyota Venza is a mid-size crossover SUV that offers a blend of car-like handling and SUV versatility. It was available with two engine options: a 2.7-liter inline-4 engine producing 182 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 268 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Venza for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and Toyota reliability. Common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling and limited off-road capability.
