The 2016 Toyota Venza is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and Toyota's reputation for reliability. It came standard with a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine producing 181 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, with an optional 3.5-liter V6 engine generating 268 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque.
