The 2023 Toyota Venza is a hybrid-only mid-size crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. It comes standard with a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with three electric motors (two in the front, one in the rear) for a combined output of 219 horsepower and an electronic continuously variable transmission (eCVT). Owners generally appreciate the Venza's stylish design, quiet cabin, and excellent gas mileage. Some common complaints include the somewhat limited cargo space compared to other SUVs in its class, and the slightly underwhelming acceleration.
