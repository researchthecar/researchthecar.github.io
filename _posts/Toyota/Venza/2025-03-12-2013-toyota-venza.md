The 2013 Toyota Venza is a five-passenger crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available features. The base engine is a 2.7-liter four-cylinder producing 181 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 3.5-liter V6, generating 268 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque, was also available. Both engines were paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Venza for its car-like handling and smooth ride. Common dislikes include its somewhat bland styling and less than stellar fuel economy compared to other SUVs.

**Summary**

The 2013 Toyota Venza, while generally reliable, exhibits some common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around potential engine oil consumption (particularly in the 2.7L), transmission shifting problems, and electrical issues like power door lock failures. Dashboard cracking is also a frequently reported problem. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but some repairs like engine work or transmission overhauls can be quite expensive. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have a thorough inspection performed before purchasing a used 2013 Venza.
