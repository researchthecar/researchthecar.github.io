The 2010 Toyota Venza is a versatile crossover SUV that blends the comfort of a sedan with the functionality of an SUV. It was available with two engine options: a 2.7L inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 delivering 268 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Venza for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability, but some common complaints include electrical issues, excessive oil consumption (particularly with the V6), and certain interior trim problems.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. The oil light may illuminate indicating low oil levels.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings may resolve the issue. However, the severity of the oil consumption can vary, and a complete engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary in extreme cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+

**3.5L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.7L engine, the 3.5L V6 can also suffer from excessive oil consumption. Owners might notice the need to add oil more frequently than usual, accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust in severe cases.
    *   Solution:  Replacing piston rings or valve stem seals might reduce oil consumption. A compression test and leak-down test can help pinpoint the source of the problem.  In severe cases, engine replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (U660E - 2.7L, U660E - 3.5L)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or delayed shifting between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. The transmission may hesitate before engaging a gear, leading to a momentary loss of power.
    *   Solution:  A transmission fluid flush may provide temporary relief. In other cases, valve body replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild are required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$3,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension begins to sag and droop lower to the ground in the rear causing a poor ride quality.
    * Solution: Replace rear shocks or complete rear suspension rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1,000+

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks may intermittently fail to lock or unlock, or may function erratically. All doors, or just one door may be affected.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator is the most common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system screen may freeze, reboot unexpectedly, or display incorrect information. The system may also become unresponsive to inputs.
    *   Solution: A software update or replacement of the navigation unit may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch struts may weaken over time, causing the hatch to close unexpectedly or fail to stay open.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear hatch struts is a straightforward fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard may develop cracks, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight. This issue is more prevalent in hotter climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Toyota Venza, while generally reliable, does have some common issues owners may encounter. The most significant problems revolve around excessive oil consumption with both the 2.7L and 3.5L engines, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues, such as power door lock malfunctions and navigation system failures, are also fairly common. Suspension and Interior issues can also be experienced, but are much less common. While the Venza enjoys a reputation for reliability, being aware of these potential problems and having them inspected before purchasing a used model is advisable.
