The 2009 Toyota Venza is a mid-size crossover SUV that offered a blend of car-like handling and SUV-like versatility. Engine options included a 2.7-liter inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5-liter V6 producing 268 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Venza for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. Common complaints included the vehicle's bland styling and mediocre fuel economy, particularly with the V6 engine.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every few thousand miles, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a possible burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: The issue can sometimes be addressed by replacing the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve, which helps regulate crankcase pressure. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50 for PCV valve replacement; $2,000 - $4,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Oil Leak from Timing Cover**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing cover can develop an oil leak over time. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle and visible oil residue around the front of the engine.
    *   Solution: The solution is to reseal or replace the timing cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or delayed shifting, particularly when cold. Hesitation during acceleration may also occur.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush can sometimes improve shifting. In other cases, valve body issues or solenoid failure might require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush; $500 - $1,500+ for valve body or solenoid replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, particularly if the vehicle is frequently used for towing or hauling heavy loads. This can lead to a rougher ride and reduced ground clearance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shocks or struts can sometimes address the issue. In severe cases, replacing the rear springs might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 for shock/strut replacement; $400 - $1,000+ for spring replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks may fail to function correctly, with some doors not locking or unlocking remotely.
    *   Solution: The solution is to replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door.
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Navigation System/Radio Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system or radio can experience complete failure or intermittent issues. This can include a blank screen, inability to tune to stations, or loss of GPS signal.
    *   Solution: Sometimes a software update can resolve the issue. In other cases, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software updates; $300 - $1,000+ for unit replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors can fail, causing the TPMS warning light to illuminate even when tire pressure is correct.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty TPMS sensor(s) is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch struts (also called lift supports) can weaken over time, causing the hatch to be difficult to open or stay open.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear hatch struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Toyota Venza is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported a few common issues. The most concerning problems relate to excessive oil consumption in the 2.7L engine and oil leaks from the timing cover on the 3.5L V6 engine. Transmission issues such as rough shifting can also occur. Electrical issues such as TPMS sensor failure and power door lock actuator failures are also common. While most issues are not catastrophic, they can lead to significant repair costs over time. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic before purchasing.
