The 2014 Toyota Venza is a versatile crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It was available with two engine options: a 2.7-liter inline-4 producing 181 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 delivering 268 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Venza for its smooth driving experience and ample cargo space, but some have expressed concerns about its fuel economy and limited off-road capabilities.
