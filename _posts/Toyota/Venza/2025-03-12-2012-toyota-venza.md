The 2012 Toyota Venza is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and refined driving experience. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.7L inline-4 producing 181 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 generating 268 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Venza for its car-like handling and ample cargo space, while some criticisms include its somewhat bland styling and limited off-road capabilities.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potentially engine knocking if the oil level becomes critically low.
    *   Solution: The recommended course of action begins with a leakdown test of all cylinders. If the test confirms oil is leaking through the piston rings, the recommended solution is an engine replacement or a complete engine rebuild including replacing the rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the water pump area, overheating, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Oil Cooler Line Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rubber portion of the oil cooler line may develop leaks.
    * Solution: Replace the oil cooler lines
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$600
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **VVTi Oil Line Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks originating from the Variable Valve Timing intelligent (VVTi) oil line, particularly the rubber hose section.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Slipping may also occur, where the engine RPM increases without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: Begin by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, a fluid flush and filter replacement may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.

**Summary**

The 2012 Toyota Venza, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The most concerning are potential engine problems, such as excessive oil consumption in the 2.7L inline-4 and oil leaks in the 3.5L V6, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can also be expensive to address. Other issues, such as suspension wear and electrical problems, are more typical for a vehicle of this age and can be addressed at a moderate cost. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed to check for these common issues.
