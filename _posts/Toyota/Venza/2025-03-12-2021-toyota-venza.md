The 2021 Toyota Venza is a hybrid-only mid-size crossover SUV offering a blend of fuel efficiency, comfort, and modern styling. It features a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with three electric motors, delivering a combined 219 horsepower. All models come standard with all-wheel drive and an Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). Owners often praise its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and excellent fuel economy. Common criticisms include limited cargo space compared to competitors, and some find the infotainment system less intuitive than others.
