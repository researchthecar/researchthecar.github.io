**Introduction:**

The 1995 Toyota Supra is a legendary sports car known for its powerful inline-6 engine and rear-wheel-drive performance. It was available with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 2JZ-GE and a turbocharged 2JZ-GTE. Both engines were mated to a 6-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Despite its performance credentials, the Supra has faced several common issues over the years.

**Engine**

    * Solution: Replace head gasket and associated components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Carbon Buildup on Pistons:** Over time, carbon deposits can accumulate on the pistons, causing reduced compression, knocking, and performance issues.
    * Solution: Clean carbon deposits or replace pistons if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2JZ-GTE**
