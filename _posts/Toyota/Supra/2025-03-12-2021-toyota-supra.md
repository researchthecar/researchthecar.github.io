The 2021 Toyota Supra marked the second year of the vehicle's reintroduction and continued the collaboration with BMW. It's offered with two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 generating 382 horsepower and 368 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Supra for its sharp handling, powerful engines (especially the 3.0L), and distinctive styling. Criticisms frequently include limited headroom, particularly with the helmet restrictions, a small trunk, and some find the BMW-sourced interior components detract from the Toyota feel.
