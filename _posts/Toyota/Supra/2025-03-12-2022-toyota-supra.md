The 2022 Toyota Supra marked the third year of the revived sports car, continuing its collaboration with BMW. It came with two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 generating 382 horsepower and 368 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Supra for its sharp handling, quick acceleration, and distinctive styling. Criticisms often revolve around its limited interior space, compromised visibility, and the fact that some consider it too heavily reliant on BMW components.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. The exact cause is not universally agreed upon, but some speculate it's related to the engine's design or break-in process. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating on the dash and the need to add oil.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed is the initial step. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection is recommended, potentially involving oil consumption tests, leak checks, and ultimately, possible engine component replacement if a specific cause is identified.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the cause; diagnostics may be $100 - $200+, minor repairs $500+, and major engine work could exceed $5,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifts, particularly during low-speed maneuvers or when shifting between drive and reverse. This is not affecting all owners of the Supra, but it is occurring.
    *   Solution: Software reflash.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ depending on the dealership.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of the BMW-sourced infotainment system freezing, crashing, or exhibiting lag. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Attempting a system reset is the first step. Software updates may also address the issue. If problems persist, component replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $1000+ (for component replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have complained about rattling noises emanating from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear hatch area. The specific location and intensity vary.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and applying sound-deadening material or tightening loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the complexity and location of the rattle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Toyota Supra, while a generally well-regarded sports car, has a handful of reported issues. The most concerning are the oil consumption in the 3.0L engine, rough/delayed shifting, and electrical issues with the infotainment system. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly, with engine-related problems potentially being the most expensive. Most reported issues are minor.
