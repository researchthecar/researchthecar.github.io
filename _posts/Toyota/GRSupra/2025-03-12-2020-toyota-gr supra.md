The 2020 Toyota GR Supra marked the return of an iconic nameplate, developed in collaboration with BMW and sharing many components with the BMW Z4. The 2020 GR Supra was available with a single engine option: a BMW-sourced 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine, producing 335 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The GR Supra was praised for its sharp handling, powerful engine, and distinctive styling. However, some common complaints include limited headroom, small trunk space, and a perceived lack of Toyota DNA due to its BMW underpinnings. Some owners have also reported certain mechanical and electrical issues.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-Six (B58)**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant and oil leak externally from the oil filter housing. The gasket between the oil filter housing and the engine block degrades. May cause overheating and low oil pressure if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil filter housing gasket or the entire oil filter housing assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on whether it is the gasket only or the entire unit, and whether it is DIY or shop work.

*   **Coolant Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant will leak out of the engine bay in the front.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking coolant line.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or jerky shifts, particularly during low-speed driving. Hesitation or delay when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) have been known to fix the issues, but in some cases the valve body or mechatronics unit needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (for software update) - $3,000+ (for valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, which is BMW-sourced, can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or reboot spontaneously. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates, restarting the system. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1,500+ (for head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poorly Aligned Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted inconsistencies in body panel alignment, particularly around the doors, hood, and trunk. This can affect the car's appearance and potentially lead to wind noise or water leaks.
    *   Solution: Adjust or realign the body panels to factory specifications.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the severity and shop rates.

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area. This can be caused by loose trim pieces or poorly secured components.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and secure or replace the affected component. Some owners have had success with adding foam or felt padding to reduce vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the complexity of the repair.

**Summary**

The 2020 Toyota GR Supra offers impressive performance and striking looks, but it isn't without its potential issues. Engine oil leaks and transmission harshness are notable mechanical concerns, while electrical glitches in the infotainment system can also be frustrating. Body panel alignment issues and interior rattles, while primarily cosmetic, can detract from the overall ownership experience. The severity of these issues varies, and many can be addressed with software updates or relatively minor repairs. However, more extensive repairs, such as transmission or infotainment system replacements, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
