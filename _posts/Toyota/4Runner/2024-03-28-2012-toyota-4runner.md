**Introduction to the 2012 Toyota 4Runner:**

The 2012 Toyota 4Runner is a midsize SUV that offers rugged off-road capabilities and a spacious interior. It is available with a choice of three engines and two transmission options. The 4.0-liter V6 engine produces 270 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque, while the 4.6-liter V8 engine generates 301 horsepower and 327 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission.
