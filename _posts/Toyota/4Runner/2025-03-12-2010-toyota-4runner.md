The 2010 Toyota 4Runner marked the beginning of the fifth generation. It was available with a 4.0L V6 engine (1GR-FE) producing 270 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque and a 2.7L I4 engine (2TR-FE) producing 157 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque. The V6 was paired with a five-speed automatic transmission (A750F/E), while the I4 came with a four-speed automatic transmission (A340E). Owners generally appreciate the 4Runner's off-road capability, reliability, and cargo space. Common dislikes include fuel economy, and a somewhat dated interior.

**Summary**

The 2010 Toyota 4Runner generally holds up well but has some common issues to watch out for. The secondary air injection pump failure on the V6 engine is a known problem, and the X-REAS suspension (if equipped) is prone to failure. Rust, especially on the frame, is a significant concern in certain regions. Interior issues like cracked dashboards and console latches are less critical but can detract from the ownership experience. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should inspect vehicles carefully and be aware of these potential problem areas.
