The 2012 Toyota 4Runner is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners have reported issues with the engine, transmission, suspension, electrical systems, and exterior. Engine issues such as water pump failure and valve cover gasket leaks are fairly common and are moderately expensive to fix. Models equipped with the X-REAS suspension may experience issues with the shock absorbers, and rust on the frame can be a concern, especially in regions with road salt. While these issues exist, they are not necessarily indicative of widespread problems, and many 2012 4Runners continue to provide reliable service.
