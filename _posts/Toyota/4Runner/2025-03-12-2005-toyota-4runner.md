The 2005 Toyota 4Runner is a popular SUV known for its reliability and off-road capability. It was available with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing 245 horsepower and 282 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.7L V8 producing 270 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 4Runner for its durability and dependability but occasionally report issues related to age and mileage, such as rust and certain mechanical failures.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

*   **Failed Air/Fuel Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Air/Fuel sensor has a failed heating element. Causes a check engine light, poor fuel economy, and potentially rough running.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty Air/Fuel sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cracked Exhaust Manifold**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold cracks, often near the catalytic converter connection. This causes a ticking sound, especially upon cold starts, and can lead to exhaust leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.7L V8**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, leading to oil consumption and potential burning smells.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Replacement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While not a failure, the timing belt requires periodic replacement. Failure to do so can result in catastrophic engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, water pump, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **"Pink Milkshake" (Radiator Failure)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radiator can fail internally, allowing coolant to mix with the transmission fluid. This is known as "pink milkshake" and can cause significant damage to the transmission. Symptoms include transmission slipping, erratic shifting, and a milky pink fluid on the transmission dipstick.
    *   Solution: Replace the radiator and flush the transmission thoroughly. In severe cases, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the severity of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Lower ball joints can wear and fail, leading to excessive play in the front suspension and potential loss of control.
    *   Solution: Replace the lower ball joints. It is often recommended to replace the upper control arms at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Air Suspension (If Equipped) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 4Runners were equipped with a rear air suspension system that can fail over time, resulting in a sagging rear end, a non-functioning air compressor, and warning lights on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replace the air springs, air compressor, or related components. Conversion to coil springs is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1500+ (depending on the component and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working, often one at a time.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (per window)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver/Passenger door wiring harness broken**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Wires will crack/break internally where they flex when opening and closing the door.
    *   Solution: Replace the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust, especially in areas with road salt, is a common issue on older 4Runners. This can affect the frame, body panels, and undercarriage components.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement. Frame rust may require more extensive repairs or even frame replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: Recall Number 05V225000 - This recall was issued for excessive corrosion of the spare tire carrier assembly.

**Interior**

*   **Multi-Information Display (MID) Pixels Failing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels on the Multi-Information Display (MID) in the instrument cluster can fail, making it difficult to read the displayed information.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MID or instrument cluster. Some repair services offer pixel repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Toyota 4Runner, while generally reliable, exhibits common issues associated with age, such as rust, suspension wear, and potential radiator failure ("pink milkshake"). The "pink milkshake" issue is particularly concerning due to the potential for extensive transmission damage. Electrical issues and minor engine problems are also reported. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, addressing rust or major mechanical failures like a transmission rebuild can be costly. The lower ball joints, air suspension, and cracked exhaust manifolds were also common issues. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for rust, check the transmission fluid condition, and be prepared for potential repairs related to aging components.
