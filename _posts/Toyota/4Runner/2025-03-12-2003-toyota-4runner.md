The 2003 Toyota 4Runner is a popular SUV known for its reliability and off-road capability. It was available with two engine options: a 2.7L Inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.7L V8 generating 235 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the 4Runner's ruggedness, longevity, and strong resale value. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated interior and the fuel economy, especially with the V8 engine.
