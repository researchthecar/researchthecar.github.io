The 2000 Toyota 4Runner is a popular SUV known for its reliability and off-road capability. Available engine options included a 2.7L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4L V6 engine producing 183 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were generally paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, although a 5-speed manual transmission was available with the 2.7L engine. Owners often praise the 4Runner for its durability, longevity, and off-road prowess. Common complaints include its relatively low fuel economy compared to modern SUVs and some age-related maintenance issues.

**Engine**

**3.4L V6**
* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell. Oil consumption may increase.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Belt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 3.4L V6 is an interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, the pistons can collide with the valves, causing significant engine damage. Symptoms of a failing timing belt may include a ticking noise from the engine or difficulty starting.
    * Solution: Replace the timing belt, water pump, and associated idler pulleys as a preventative maintenance measure, typically every 90,000 miles.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, decreased fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the MAF sensor. Cleaning the sensor *may* temporarily resolve the issue, but replacement is generally recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.7L Inline-4**
* **Exhaust Manifold Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: A ticking noise, especially upon cold start, that diminishes as the engine warms up. Exhaust leak smell.
    * Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A340E 4-Speed Automatic (Common to both 2.7L and 3.4L)**

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delays when shifting between gears, or harsh/jerky shifts. Can worsen over time.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, it could indicate worn valve body or internal components, requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 for fluid/filter change; $1500-$3000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Coil Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than the front, especially noticeable when loaded. Can affect ride quality and handling.
    * Solution: Replace the rear coil springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs is also an option for improved load carrying capacity.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A clunking noise from the front suspension, especially over bumps. Excessive play in the front wheels when lifted. Can lead to catastrophic suspension failure if ignored.
    * Solution: Replace the lower ball joints. It's recommended to replace both lower ball joints at the same time, and to also inspect and replace the upper ball joints and other suspension components as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window moves slowly, erratically, or not at all.
    * Solution: Replace the power window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Starter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clicking noise when turning the key, engine not cranking.
    * Solution: Replace the starter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Frame**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible rust on the frame, especially in areas exposed to road salt. Can weaken the frame over time.
    * Solution: Rust removal and treatment. In severe cases, frame repair or replacement may be necessary (very expensive).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for DIY treatment) to $5000+ (for frame replacement, which may not be economically feasible)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for a cover) to $1000+ (for replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Toyota 4Runner is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any older car, it is prone to certain age-related issues. The most concerning are frame rust and timing belt issues on the 3.4L V6, which can be costly to repair. Valve cover leaks, suspension wear, electrical issues, and interior issues are also common. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of them and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing. While minor repairs can be relatively inexpensive, major repairs like frame replacement or transmission rebuilds can quickly add up, so factor this into the purchase price.
