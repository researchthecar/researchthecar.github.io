The 2014 Toyota 4Runner is a rugged, body-on-frame SUV known for its off-road capabilities and reliability. It came equipped with a single engine option, a 4.0L V6 producing 270 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the 4Runner's durability and off-road prowess, but some dislike its fuel economy and outdated interior.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Fluid leaks from the X-REAS shocks, reduced ride quality, excessive body roll during cornering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking X-REAS shocks and lines, or complete removal of the X-REAS system and replacement with standard shocks and springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ (for X-REAS replacement), $500 - $1000+ (for standard suspension conversion)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Entune System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation glitches.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available), replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on repair or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Toyota 4Runner is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as water pump and secondary air injection pump failures, potential transmission issues, and rust, especially in colder climates. The X-REAS suspension, if equipped, can also be a source of expensive repairs. While the issues can be costly, they are not universally experienced and the 4Runner's overall reputation for longevity remains strong.
