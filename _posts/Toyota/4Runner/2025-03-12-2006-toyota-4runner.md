**Summary**

The 2006 Toyota 4Runner is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine issues like head gasket leaks (4.0L V6) and exhaust manifold cracks (4.7L V8) can be expensive to repair. Transmission problems, if they arise, can also be costly. Suspension components like ball joints and (if equipped) air suspension systems are prone to wear and failure. Electrical issues such as alternator and clock spring failures are also relatively common. Finally, frame rust can be a significant concern, especially in regions with road salt. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially dangerous situations, and the costs to fix can vary widely.
