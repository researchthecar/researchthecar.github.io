The 2021 Toyota 4Runner is a body-on-frame SUV known for its ruggedness, off-road capability, and reliability. Its popularity stems from its reputation for longevity and strong resale value. However, it also faces criticisms for its outdated design, poor fuel economy, and limited interior space compared to some competitors. The 2021 4Runner comes exclusively with a 4.0-liter V6 engine producing 270 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6 (1GR-FE)**

*   **Timing Cover Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak originating from the timing cover area. May notice oil spots under the vehicle and a burning oil smell. Can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if left unattended.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing cover gasket/seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VVTi System Oil Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil Leak coming from the VVTi actuator, oil pooling on top of the engine or down the side of the engine near the valve cover.
    *   Solution: Replace VVTi Actuator and Gasket
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (A750F)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear or 2nd and 3rd gear. Can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and replacement can improve the shifting. However, if the issue persists, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush: $200 - $400; Valve Body Replacement: $800 - $2,000; Rebuild: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks (especially on models with X-REAS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible fluid leaking from the rear shock absorbers. Leads to diminished ride quality, increased body roll, and reduced handling performance. Models equipped with the X-REAS (Cross-linked Relative Absorber System) suspension are particularly prone to this issue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking shock absorbers. If equipped with X-REAS, replacing the entire system is recommended due to the interconnected nature of the system, but can be very expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Standard Shock Replacement: $300 - $800 per pair; X-REAS Replacement: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Entune Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the infotainment system, including freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software update if available. If the issue persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: Free (at dealership); Head Unit Replacement: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Roof Rack Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin of the vehicle around the headliner and pillars as a result of failed roof rack seals.
    * Solution: Resealing the roof rack and potentially replacing the seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Loose Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that certain interior trim pieces, particularly around the dashboard or door panels, can become loose or rattle over time.
    *   Solution: Re-securing the trim pieces, potentially with new clips or fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2021 Toyota 4Runner generally retains its reputation for reliability, but owners do encounter some common issues. The most concerning issues revolve around the engine timing cover leaks, harsh shifting in the transmission, and X-REAS suspension failure, which can be expensive to repair. Electrical issues with the Entune system are also common annoyances. While these problems exist, they don't necessarily affect every vehicle and the 4Runner is still regarded as a dependable choice.
