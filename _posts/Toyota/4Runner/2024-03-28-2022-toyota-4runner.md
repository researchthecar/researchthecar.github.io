## 2022 Toyota 4Runner

The 2022 Toyota 4Runner is a mid-size SUV that offers a rugged and capable off-road experience. It is powered by a standard 4.0-liter V6 engine that produces 270 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque. Paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, the 4Runner provides ample power for both on-road and off-road adventures.

While the 4Runner is praised for its reliability and off-road prowess, it is not without its issues. Here is a detailed overview of the specific issues reported by owners:

### Engine

- **Timing Chain Noise:** A noisy timing chain can occur, causing a rattling or ticking sound. Replacing the timing chain and tensioners is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

### Transmission

**5-Speed Automatic**

- **Shifting Issues:** Some owners have reported delayed or rough shifting, as well as slipping gears. Potential causes include worn clutch packs or faulty solenoids. A transmission rebuild or solenoid replacement may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
- **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** Leaks can occur from the transmission pan gasket or seals. Symptoms include a low transmission fluid level and slipping gears. Replacing the affected gaskets or seals is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

### Suspension

### Summary

Overall, the 2022 Toyota 4Runner is known for its reliability and off-road capabilities. However, some owners have reported issues with the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems.
