**Summary**

The 2013 Toyota 4Runner, while generally reliable, can experience issues such as water pump and secondary air injection pump failures on the engine, and occasional transmission problems. Suspension issues with the X-REAS system are also common, especially on Limited models. Electrical glitches and dashboard cracking are relatively minor annoyances. Frame rust, particularly in regions using road salt, is a significant concern. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine, suspension, or frame repairs. The X-REAS suspension can be a high cost to maintain and the age of the vehicle can cause issues.
