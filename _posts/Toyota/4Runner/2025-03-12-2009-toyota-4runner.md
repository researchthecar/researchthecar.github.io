The 2009 Toyota 4Runner is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, off-road capability, and overall durability. Engine options included a 4.0L V6 producing 236 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.7L V8 producing 260 horsepower and 306 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 4Runner for its ruggedness and longevity, but some dislike its fuel economy and somewhat dated interior.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover gasket onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell and potential fire hazard. Visible oil residue around the valve cover.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes related to the secondary air injection system. Loud noise from the pump upon startup. This system assists in cold starts to reduce emissions.
    *   Solution: Replace the air injection pump and possibly the air injection valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.7L V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Crack**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing noise from the engine, especially upon cold starts. This is caused by cracks in the exhaust manifold.
    *   Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Replacement Required**
    *   Description/Symptoms: As preventive maintenance, the timing belt on the 4.7L V8 should be replaced at specified intervals (typically every 90,000 miles). Failure to do so can result in catastrophic engine damage if the belt breaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, water pump, tensioner, and idler pulleys as a preventative maintenance measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibration felt at low speeds or during light acceleration, particularly when the torque converter is locking up.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush, or replace the torque converter if the flush doesn't resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $200-$400; Torque converter replacement $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, loose steering. Excessive play in the lower ball joints when inspected.
    *   Solution: Replace the front lower ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Air Suspension (If Equipped) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sags, compressor doesn't engage, or the vehicle rides unevenly. The air springs may leak or the compressor may fail.
    *   Solution: Replace the air springs, compressor, or both. Some owners opt to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air spring replacement $400 - $800 per side; Compressor replacement $500 - $1000; Coil spring conversion $500 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window operates slowly, intermittently, or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Starter Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noise when trying to start the engine, or the engine doesn't crank at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the starter motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust accumulation on the frame, especially in areas prone to road salt exposure. Can lead to structural weakness.
    *   Solution: Rust remediation (wire brushing, rust converter application) or, in severe cases, frame replacement/repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Rust remediation $100 - $500+; Frame repair/replacement $2000+ (can be much higher)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates due to sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dashboard cover $50 - $200; Dashboard replacement $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Toyota 4Runner is generally a reliable vehicle, but common issues include valve cover gasket leaks, air injection pump failures (4.0L V6), exhaust manifold cracks and timing belt replacement (4.7L V8), torque converter shudder, and front lower ball joint failure. Electrical issues such as power window motor and starter motor failures can also occur. Frame rust is a concern, especially in regions with road salt. Interior dashboard cracking is a cosmetic issue. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs.
