The 2011 Toyota 4Runner is a rugged and reliable mid-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities and longevity. It was offered with a 4.0-liter V6 engine that produced 270 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the 4Runner's durability, spacious interior, and strong resale value. Common complaints include the vehicle's fuel economy and somewhat dated interior design, as well as body roll.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6 (1GR-FE)**

*   **Secondary Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes related to the secondary air injection system (P0418, P0419, P0410, P0412, P0415, P0416, P2440, P2441, P2442, P2443, P2444). The pump may be noisy or fail completely, leading to the vehicle entering limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the secondary air injection pump and/or valve(s). Some owners have installed bypass kits to circumvent the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell. Visible oil accumulation around the valve covers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (A750F/A750E)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, especially at lower speeds and during light acceleration. This can be more prevalent after the transmission fluid warms up.
    *   Solution: Perform a complete transmission fluid flush and replacement using Toyota WS fluid. If the shudder persists, torque converter replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400 for fluid flush, $800-$1500+ for torque converter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **X-REAS (Cross Linked Relative Absorber System) Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking fluid from the shocks. Excessive body roll during cornering. A generally poor or bouncy ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the X-REAS system or conversion to a standard shock and spring setup. The X-REAS system is expensive to repair, leading some to opt for aftermarket suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+ for X-REAS replacement, $800 - $2000 for aftermarket suspension conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Coil Spring Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than the front. Reduced ride height in the rear, leading to potential bottoming out on rough terrain or when loaded.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs. Some owners opt for aftermarket springs designed for heavier loads or to restore ride height.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600

**Electrical**

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing phones, dropped connections, poor audio quality.
    *   Solution: Software update to the head unit (if available). Replacement of the head unit if the issue persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $300 - $1000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust on the vehicle's frame, especially in areas exposed to road salt. This can lead to structural weakness over time.
    *   Solution: Rust remediation, frame coating, or in severe cases, frame replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.

**Summary**

The 2011 Toyota 4Runner is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the secondary air injection system and X-REAS suspension if equipped. Frame rust is also a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for more extensive problems like frame repair or X-REAS replacement. While some issues are more prevalent than others, proper maintenance and regular inspections can help mitigate the risk of major repairs.
