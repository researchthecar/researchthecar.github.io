The 2001 Toyota 4Runner is a popular SUV known for its reliability and off-road capability. The 2001 model came with two engine options: a 2.7L Inline-4 engine producing 150 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.4L V6 engine that delivers 183 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission, though the manual was less common, particularly with the V6. Owners appreciate the 4Runner's ruggedness, longevity, and strong resale value. Common complaints often involve the age-related wear and tear of components and lower fuel economy compared to modern SUVs.

**Summary**

The 2001 Toyota 4Runner is a generally reliable vehicle, but age-related issues are common. Engine issues such as valve cover leaks and exhaust manifold cracks are manageable, but timing belt service on the V6 is a crucial maintenance item. Transmission issues like shift solenoid failure can occur. Suspension problems such as ball joint failure and rear coil sag can affect ride quality and safety. Electrical gremlins and rust are also potential concerns. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can help maintain the 4Runner's reliability and longevity.
