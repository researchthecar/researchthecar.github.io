The 2004 Toyota Matrix is a compact hatchback/wagon known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It was offered with two engine options: a 1.8L 4-cylinder (1ZZ-FE) producing 130 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque and a higher-performance 1.8L 4-cylinder (2ZZ-GE) producing 180 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque (XRS model). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic, with the XRS model also offering a 6-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the Matrix's cargo space, fuel economy, and Toyota's reputation for reliability. Common complaints often revolve around the base engine's lack of power, the automatic transmission's responsiveness, and some reported issues with oil consumption and rust.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FE Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust. Can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings and valve stem seals can mitigate the issue. However, more severe cases may require a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Failed Pre-Cats in the Exhaust Manifold**
    * Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converters in the exhaust manifold can break down, sending debris back into the engine which can damage the engine.
    * Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.8L 2ZZ-GE Engine**

*   **High Oil Consumption (Similar to 1ZZ-FE but potentially exacerbated by higher RPM driving)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Increased oil consumption, particularly at higher RPMs. Requires frequent monitoring and topping off.
    *   Solution: Similar to the 1ZZ-FE, piston ring and valve stem seal replacement may help. Engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lift Bolt Failure (XRS Models)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "lift bolts" that engage the high-RPM valve lift system (VVTLi) can shear, resulting in a loss of power above 6,000 RPM. Engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the lift bolts with updated, stronger versions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, especially when cold. Can also be accompanied by delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, valve body issues may need to be addressed. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**
No Issues Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**
No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Wheel Bearings Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding, humming, or roaring noise coming from the rear wheels, especially noticeable at higher speeds. Play or looseness in the rear wheels can be detected when lifted.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn wheel bearings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Worn or cracked strut mounts may be visible upon inspection.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Light Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bulbs in the instrument cluster burn out, leading to dim or non-functional gauges.
    *   Solution: Replace the burned-out bulbs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in areas with road salt)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the undercarriage, rocker panels, and around wheel wells. Can lead to structural damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Treat existing rust with rust converter and apply protective coatings. In severe cases, body panel replacement or repair may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or splitting of the dashboard material, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver side door wire harness failures.**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Wires in the door wire harness will crack and split causing the power locks and windows to not work properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the wires in the harness, or replace the entire harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Toyota Matrix, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption in both the 1ZZ-FE and 2ZZ-GE engines, which can lead to costly repairs. Rust is another potential issue, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Other issues, such as suspension wear and electrical glitches, are typical for vehicles of this age. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major repairs, with costs varying accordingly. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
