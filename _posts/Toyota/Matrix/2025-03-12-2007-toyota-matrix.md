The 2007 Toyota Matrix is a compact hatchback known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. Available with either a 1.8L inline-4 engine (1ZZ-FE) producing approximately 126 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque or a 2.4L inline-4 (2AZ-FE) producing approximately 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, it offered a blend of economy and adequate performance. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise its spacious interior, cargo capacity, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common complaints include the somewhat basic interior, road noise, and the performance of the smaller 1.8L engine, especially when loaded.

**Summary**

The most significant concerns are the potential for excessive oil consumption in both engine variants, and the transmission, but other issues include rear wheel bearings, electrical problems (clock spring) and rust on the rear hatch. While some of these issues may be relatively inexpensive to address, others, such as engine repair or replacement, can be costly. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase.
