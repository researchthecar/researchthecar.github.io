The 2014 Toyota Matrix is a compact hatchback known for its reliability and practicality. It was available with two engine options: a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 132 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic (1.8L), and a 5-speed automatic (2.4L). Owners often praise the Matrix for its fuel efficiency, cargo space, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling and basic interior features, along with occasionally underpowered acceleration, especially with the 1.8L engine.
