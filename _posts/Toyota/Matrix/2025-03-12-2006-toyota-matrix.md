The 2006 Toyota Matrix is a compact hatchback/wagon known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. It was offered with two engine options: a 1.8L 4-cylinder engine (1ZZ-FE) producing around 130 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.4L 4-cylinder engine (2AZ-FE) found in the XRS trim, making approximately 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic for the 1.8L engine, and a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic for the 2.4L engine. Owners generally appreciate the Matrix's spacious interior, good gas mileage, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes often include the somewhat bland styling and, depending on the engine, the lack of thrilling performance.

**Summary**

The 2006 Toyota Matrix, while generally reliable, has some common issues owners may encounter. The most concerning is the potential for excessive oil consumption in both engine options, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical and suspension issues are also relatively common. While some repairs are inexpensive, others, such as engine work or transmission issues, can be more substantial. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these problems and factor potential repair costs into their purchase decision.
