**2004 Toyota Matrix**

The 2004 Toyota Matrix is a compact hatchback/crossover that offers a spacious interior, versatile cargo space, and a comfortable ride. It is powered by a standard 1.8L 4-cylinder engine that produces 126 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. The Matrix is also available with a more powerful 2.4L 4-cylinder engine that produces 164 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

Despite its popularity, the 2004 Toyota Matrix has had its fair share of issues. Here is a comprehensive list of the specific problems that have been reported by owners:

**Engine**

* **2.4L 4-cylinder engine**
    * **Oil consumption:** Some Matrix models equipped with the 2.4L engine may consume excessive oil. This can lead to engine damage if not addressed. The issue can often be resolved by replacing the piston rings and valve seals. $1,500 - $2,000+

**Transmission**
