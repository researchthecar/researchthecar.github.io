The 2012 Toyota Matrix is a compact hatchback known for its reliability and practicality. Engine options include a 1.8L inline-4 producing 132 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic (1.8L), and a 5-speed automatic (2.4L). Owners generally appreciate the Matrix for its fuel efficiency, spacious cargo area, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes include a somewhat bland interior and less-than-exciting handling compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**1.8L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the need to add a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less. Blue exhaust smoke may also be present.
    *   Solution: A possible solution involves replacing the piston rings with an updated design that improves oil control. In severe cases, the entire engine may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, similar to the 1.8L. This can manifest as the need to add a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less. Blue exhaust smoke may also be present.
    *   Solution: A possible solution involves replacing the piston rings with an updated design that improves oil control. In severe cases, the entire engine may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (1.8L)**
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between first and second gear. The transmission may also hesitate before engaging a gear.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (2.4L)**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**
*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, leading to a lower ride height and reduced load-carrying capacity. This is often caused by worn-out rear coil springs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear coil springs with new ones, possibly upgraded heavy-duty springs, is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**
*   **Airbag Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag light may illuminate on the dashboard, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system. This can be caused by a faulty clock spring, seat position sensor, or other airbag system components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause with a scan tool is essential. Replacing the faulty component, such as the clock spring or a seat position sensor, will usually resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: 14V810000

**Exterior**
*   **Rust on Rear Hatch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rust developing around the license plate lights and handle on the rear hatch, particularly in regions with harsh winters.
    *   Solution: Repairing the rust involves sanding, treating, and repainting the affected area. Replacing the entire hatch may be necessary in cases of severe rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**
*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard may develop cracks, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard is the most effective solution, but this can be expensive. A less costly option is to use a dashboard cover or repair the cracks with a specialized filler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $1500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Toyota Matrix is generally a reliable vehicle, but potential issues include excessive oil consumption in both engine options, harsh shifting in the 4-speed automatic transmission, rear suspension sag, electrical issues with the airbag system, rust on the rear hatch, and a cracked dashboard. The severity of these issues varies, and repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for more extensive repairs like engine work. While some of the problems, like oil consumption, can be significant and costly, many owners experience few or no issues with their Matrix.
