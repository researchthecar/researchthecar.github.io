The 2011 Toyota Matrix is a compact hatchback known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It offered a choice between a 1.8L inline-4 engine producing 132 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission (1.8L engine), while the 2.4L was available with a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Matrix for its affordability, cargo space, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling and the basic interior features on lower trim levels.

Repair costs can range from relatively minor for switch replacements to potentially significant for engine work or dashboard replacement. While not widespread, the oil consumption issue should be a point of inspection for potential buyers. The rear wheel bearing issue is common for a vehicle of this age and mileage, so it should also be a focus of inspection.
