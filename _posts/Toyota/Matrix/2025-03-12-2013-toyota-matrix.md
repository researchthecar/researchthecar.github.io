The 2013 Toyota Matrix is a compact hatchback known for its reliability and practicality. It offered two engine options: a 1.8L inline-4 (132 hp, 128 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.4L inline-4 (158 hp, 162 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission (with the 1.8L) or a 5-speed automatic (with the 2.4L). Owners often praise the Matrix for its fuel efficiency, cargo space, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling and the dated 4-speed automatic transmission option on the base model.

**Summary:**

Other issues, such as harsh shifting in the automatic transmission and rear suspension sagging, are less severe but still worth considering. The electrical and interior issues are more minor annoyances than major mechanical problems. Overall, the Matrix remains a good choice for those seeking a dependable and practical hatchback, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
