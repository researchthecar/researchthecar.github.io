The 2005 Toyota Matrix is a compact hatchback known for its reliability and practicality. It was offered with two engine options: a 1.8L 4-cylinder engine (1ZZ-FE) producing 130 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 1.8L 4-cylinder engine (2ZZ-GE) producing 164 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque in the XRS model. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic (for the 1ZZ-FE), and a 6-speed manual (for the 2ZZ-GE). Owners generally appreciate the Matrix for its fuel efficiency, cargo space, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common complaints often revolve around the car's relatively basic interior, road noise, and some specific mechanical issues that can arise with age.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FE Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 1ZZ-FE engine, particularly in earlier models, is known for consuming excessive amounts of oil. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil, blue smoke from the exhaust (especially upon startup), and a burning oil smell. This issue is often caused by worn piston rings.
    * Solution: The most effective solution is to replace the piston rings. In some cases, a full engine rebuild may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket. This can lead to oil dripping onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.8L 2ZZ-GE Engine**

* **Lift Bolt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 2ZZ-GE engine, found in the XRS model, features a "lift" system that increases valve lift at higher RPMs for improved performance. The lift bolt, which is part of this system, can shear or break. This results in a loss of power above 6000 RPM (where the lift system engages).
    * Solution: Replace the lift bolt with an updated, stronger version.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (A245E)**

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or hard shifts between gears, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. This can be caused by worn valve body components or low transmission fluid.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $2,500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission (C59)**

* **No Issues Found**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission (C60)**

* **Grinding or Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, particularly 1st and 2nd, or grinding noises during shifting. This can be caused by worn synchronizers.
    * Solution: Replacement of the synchronizers or a complete transmission rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Wheel Bearing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A humming or grinding noise from the rear of the vehicle that increases with speed. The noise may change or disappear when turning.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty wheel bearing assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per wheel
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises coming from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can also cause vague steering and poor handling.
    * Solution: Replace the strut mounts. It's generally recommended to replace struts at the same time for optimal performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per axle (including struts)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power windows operate slowly, erratically, or not at all.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per window
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust (Especially in areas with road salt)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, particularly on the rocker panels, wheel wells, and undercarriage. This is more prevalent in areas where road salt is used during winter.
    * Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement. Prevention through rustproofing or regular washing is key.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the severity. $200 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks forming on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000 (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Toyota Matrix, while generally reliable, has a few common issues to watch out for. The most significant problems revolve around oil consumption in the 1ZZ-FE engine and potential lift bolt failure in the 2ZZ-GE engine. Suspension components like rear wheel bearings and strut mounts can also wear out with age. Rust is a concern, particularly in regions with road salt use. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, engine and transmission work can be costly. Overall, potential buyers should have a mechanic inspect the vehicle, paying particular attention to these common problem areas.
