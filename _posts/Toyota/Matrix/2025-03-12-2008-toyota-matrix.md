The 2008 Toyota Matrix is a compact hatchback/wagon known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. It came with two engine options: a 1.8L 4-cylinder (132 hp and 125 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.4L 4-cylinder (158 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque). The 1.8L engine was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 2.4L engine came with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate its spacious cargo area, comfortable ride, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common complaints include the somewhat bland interior, road noise, and the 4-speed automatic transmission feeling outdated compared to competitors.

**Summary**

The 2008 Toyota Matrix, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of.

Other potential problems include suspension wear and electrical component failures. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage, ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major repairs. Checking for rust and dashboard cracks is also a good idea when evaluating a used 2008 Matrix.
