The 2017 Toyota Hiace is a popular choice for commercial and passenger transport, valued for its reliability and practicality. It is offered with a range of engine options, including a 2.7L gasoline engine and a 3.0L turbo diesel engine. The 2.7L gasoline engine produces around 150 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0L diesel delivers approximately 134 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the Hiace's spacious interior, cargo capacity, and Toyota's reputation for durability. However, some common dislikes include its basic features, ride comfort, and fuel economy, particularly in the gasoline variants.

**Engine**

**2.7L Gasoline Engine**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust (particularly on startup), and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings is the most common solution. In some cases, cylinder head work may also be necessary if valve seals are worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Turbo Diesel Engine**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF clogging is a common issue, especially in vehicles used primarily for short trips or city driving. Symptoms include reduced engine power, warning lights on the dashboard, and increased fuel consumption.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration by a mechanic or replacement of the DPF unit. Regular highway driving can help prevent clogging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on repair vs replacement of the filter.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Automatic Transmission**
* **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported torque converter failure, usually at higher mileages. Symptoms can include shuddering during acceleration, poor shift quality, or a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. It's often recommended to replace the transmission fluid and filter at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially if the vehicle is frequently used for heavy loads. This can result in a lower ride height, reduced load-carrying capacity, and a harsher ride.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs. Upgraded heavy-duty leaf springs can be installed for improved load capacity and durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the central locking system. Doors may not lock or unlock with the remote or the interior switch.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing the faulty actuator or wiring in the door. In some cases, the central locking control module may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding doors can become difficult to open or close smoothly. This can be due to worn rollers, damaged tracks, or misaligned latches.
    *   Solution: Replacing or lubricating the rollers and tracks. Adjusting the door alignment and latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced cooling performance or complete failure of the air conditioning system. This can be caused by refrigerant leaks, compressor failure, or a faulty blower motor.
    *   Solution: Repairing leaks, replacing the compressor, condenser, or blower motor. Recharging the air conditioning system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Toyota Hiace, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues such as oil consumption in the gasoline engines and DPF problems in the diesel models can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission and suspension issues can also arise, impacting the vehicle's performance and ride quality. Electrical and interior issues, while less severe, can still be inconvenient for owners. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, paying particular attention to the engine, transmission, and suspension components, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
