The 2009 Toyota Hiace is a versatile and reliable van, known for its practicality and durability. It was available with a range of engines depending on the market, including the 2.7L gasoline engine and the 2.5L diesel engine. The 2.7L gasoline engine produced around 118 kW (159 hp) and 241 Nm (178 lb-ft) of torque. The 2.5L diesel engine produced around 80 kW (107 hp) and 260 Nm (192 lb-ft) of torque. Common transmissions include a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Hiace for its spaciousness, dependability, and ease of maintenance. However, some common complaints include its basic interior, limited modern features, and relatively low power output, especially in the diesel variants.

**Engine**

**2.7L Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption. This can manifest as the need to add oil more frequently between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms can include blue smoke from the exhaust pipe.
    *   Solution: A possible solution involves replacing the piston rings to ensure proper sealing. In severe cases, an engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+

**2.5L Diesel Engine**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The diesel injectors can be prone to failure, leading to rough idling, poor fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty diesel injectors is the most common solution. It's recommended to replace all injectors at once to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turbocharger problems, such as a failing turbo, can result in a significant loss of power, excessive black smoke, and unusual whistling sounds from the engine bay.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Slipping Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can experience slipping between gears, particularly when shifting from 2nd to 3rd or 3rd to 4th. This is often accompanied by delayed engagement or harsh shifting.
    *   Solution: Initially, a transmission fluid flush and filter change might help. If the problem persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Suspension bushings, particularly in the front, can wear out, leading to clunking noises during driving, especially over bumps. The vehicle may also exhibit vague steering or wandering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension bushings, control arm bushings, and sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system can occasionally malfunction, causing doors to not lock or unlock properly. This can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the fault, which could be a faulty door lock actuator, wiring issue, or a problem with the central locking module. Replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Alternator failure can lead to a dead battery, dimming headlights, and eventually the vehicle stalling. A warning light on the dashboard will usually illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding doors can become difficult to open and close smoothly, often requiring significant force. This can be due to worn rollers, damaged tracks, or misalignment.
    *   Solution: Adjusting and lubricating the door tracks and rollers. Replacing the worn rollers and tracks if needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may stop functioning, blowing only warm air. This can be caused by refrigerant leaks, compressor failure, or issues with the blower motor.
    * Solution: Diagnose the air conditioning system for leaks or component failures. Repair leaks, replace the compressor, or replace the blower motor as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Toyota Hiace, while generally reliable, can experience several common issues. Engine problems, particularly with oil consumption in the gasoline engine and injector/turbo issues in the diesel engine, can be costly. Transmission issues, especially with the 4-speed automatic, are another potential concern. Suspension and electrical faults are less severe but can still require attention. Overall, the severity and cost of repairs vary, but addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the Hiace's reliability and extend its lifespan.
