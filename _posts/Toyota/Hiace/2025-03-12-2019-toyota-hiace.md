The 2019 Toyota Hiace is a popular van known for its reliability, practicality, and spaciousness. It is often used for commercial purposes, passenger transport, and recreational vehicle conversions. Engine options vary by market but often include a 2.8L Turbo Diesel and a 2.7L Gasoline engine. The 2.8L turbo diesel produces around 161-174 horsepower and 310-330 lb-ft of torque (depending on the specific variant and market). Transmission options usually include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Hiace for its dependability and cargo capacity. Some common dislikes include its relatively basic interior and limited modern features compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.8L Turbo Diesel**

*   **Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with diesel fuel injectors failing prematurely. Symptoms include rough idling, reduced power, black smoke from the exhaust, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty injectors with updated parts is typically required. In some cases, a software update to the engine control unit (ECU) may also be recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the number of injectors that need replacing and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF, designed to trap soot from the exhaust, can become clogged, particularly with frequent short journeys. Symptoms include a warning light, reduced engine performance, and increased fuel consumption. In severe cases, the engine may enter limp mode.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (performed by a mechanic), DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement. Modifying driving habits to include longer trips at higher speeds can help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the severity of the blockage and whether cleaning or replacement is required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L Gasoline**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting between gears, particularly during low-speed acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may resolve the issue. In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may be necessary. If the problem persists, more extensive repairs such as valve body replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1500+ (depending on the severity and the required repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hiaces that are frequently loaded with heavy cargo may experience sagging of the rear leaf springs over time. This can lead to a decrease in ride height, reduced load-carrying capacity, and compromised handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs with heavy-duty aftermarket springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ (including parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic drains by testing individual circuits. Also, inspect the battery terminals and connections for corrosion. Replacement of the battery if it tests weak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the cost of the battery and any diagnostic time)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulties opening or closing the sliding doors, or excessive noise during operation. This can be due to worn rollers, damaged tracks, or misaligned latches.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the rollers and tracks. Replacement of worn rollers or damaged tracks. Adjustment of the door latch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the severity of the issue and the required repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2019 Toyota Hiace is generally a reliable vehicle, but some common issues to watch out for include diesel fuel injector problems and DPF clogging with the 2.8L diesel engine, as well as harsh shifting with the 6-speed automatic transmission. Suspension sagging and electrical issues may also occur. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's reliability. Overall, the vehicle is solid, but be aware of these potential issues.
