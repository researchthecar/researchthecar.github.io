The 2010 Toyota Hiace is a popular choice for commercial and personal use, known for its reliability and practicality. Available engine options typically included a 2.7L inline-4 gasoline engine (2TR-FE) and a 3.0L inline-4 turbo-diesel engine (1KD-FTV). The 2.7L gasoline engine produces around 118 kW (158 hp) and 241 Nm (178 lb-ft) of torque. The Hiace is generally appreciated for its spacious interior, durability, and cargo capacity. However, some common complaints include a somewhat basic interior, limited modern features for its age, and engine noise. Available transmissions generally included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic transmission, depending on the market and engine choice.

**Engine**

**2.7L 2TR-FE (Gasoline)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If excessive consumption persists, a compression test and leak-down test can help determine the source of the problem (e.g., piston rings or valve seals). Replacement of piston rings or valve seals may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L 1KD-FTV (Turbo-Diesel)**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, black smoke from the exhaust, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector and replace it. Ensure proper coding of the new injector to the engine control unit (ECU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF clogging, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and the DPF warning light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (performed by a mechanic using a diagnostic tool), or DPF replacement if regeneration is not effective. Consider driving habits that promote DPF regeneration (e.g., longer highway drives).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 for forced regeneration; $1,000 - $2,500+ for DPF replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky gear changes, especially when shifting between gears at lower speeds.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes improve shifting quality. If the problem persists, it may indicate worn or damaged internal components, requiring a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for a fluid flush and filter change; $2,000 - $4,000+ for a rebuild or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sitting lower than normal, especially when loaded. Reduced ride comfort and potential handling issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs. Consider heavy-duty leaf springs if the vehicle is frequently used for carrying heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ for parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the central locking system. Doors may not lock or unlock properly with the remote or the key.
    *   Solution: Check the central locking system fuse. If the fuse is good, diagnose the door lock actuators and wiring for faults. Replace faulty actuators or repair damaged wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door actuator; $100 - $500+ for wiring repairs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on body panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Formation of rust spots on body panels, especially in areas exposed to moisture and salt.
    *   Solution: Remove rust and refinish the affected panels. Apply rust prevention to prevent future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the severity of the damage and the quality of repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard surface, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard, or use of a dashboard cover to prevent further cracking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ for dashboard cover; $500 - $1,500+ for dashboard replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Toyota Hiace, while generally reliable, exhibits some common issues. Engine-related problems such as oil consumption in the 2.7L gasoline engine and injector/DPF issues in the 3.0L diesel can be costly to repair, especially with the DPF system. Suspension problems like sagging leaf springs are also common and affect ride quality. Electrical gremlins, like issues with the central locking system, can be inconvenient. Interior issues like dashboard cracking are mostly cosmetic. Overall, the Hiace remains a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in maintenance costs.
