**Summary**

Overall, the 2015 Toyota Hiace has a relatively low number of serious issues. The most common problems are related to the intake manifold gasket and water pump on the gasoline engine, and the diesel particulate filter and fuel injectors on the diesel engine. The transmission issues are also relatively minor and often not costly to repair. However, the rust on the frame and seat belt failure are more severe issues that should be addressed promptly.
