The 2016 Toyota Hiace is a versatile and reliable van popular for commercial and personal use, known for its spacious interior and durability. It is favored for its practicality and dependability but isn't particularly known for luxury or exciting driving dynamics. Depending on the market, the 2016 Hiace could be equipped with various engines including the 2.7L 2TR-FE inline-4 petrol engine (around 118 kW / 158 hp and 243 Nm / 179 lb-ft of torque), the 2.0L 1TR-FE inline-4 petrol engine, the 3.0L 1KD-FTV turbo diesel inline-4, or the 2.5L 2KD-FTV turbo diesel inline-4. These engines were typically paired with a 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, or 6-speed automatic transmission. Some common dislikes include the basic interior features and sometimes sluggish acceleration, especially when fully loaded.

**Engine**

**2.7L 2TR-FE Petrol**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. This may be indicated by the low oil pressure light coming on, or increased engine noise.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and use of a higher viscosity oil may help mitigate the issue. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:

**3.0L 1KD-FTV Turbo Diesel**
*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm faulty injector(s) followed by replacement. Recoding the new injectors to the ECU is essential.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF light illuminated on the dashboard, reduced engine performance, and potentially frequent regeneration cycles. This is more common in vehicles used primarily for short journeys where the DPF cannot reach the required temperature for passive regeneration.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (either through a diagnostic tool or by driving at a sustained high speed), cleaning the DPF, or DPF replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin A750E 5-Speed Automatic (common with 2.7L Petrol)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts between gears, particularly when cold. This can be more noticeable between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Begin with a full transmission flush and filter change. If the issue persists, valve body inspection and possible replacement or repair of solenoids may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sitting lower than normal, especially when loaded. Reduced ride comfort and potential for bottoming out on bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs with new or uprated springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure of the central locking system, with doors not locking or unlocking properly using the remote or internal switch.
    *   Solution: Check the fuse, check for faulty door lock actuators, and test the wiring for shorts or breaks. Replace faulty components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Roller Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door smoothly, accompanied by unusual noises (grinding, clicking).
    *   Solution: Inspection of the sliding door rollers and replacement of worn rollers or the entire roller assembly. Lubrication can provide a temporary solution, but replacement is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking/Discoloration (in hot climates)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, especially in vehicles frequently exposed to direct sunlight in hot climates. Discoloration or fading of the dashboard plastic.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement (expensive), or using a dashboard cover. Repairing existing cracks is possible but often not a long-term solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:

**Summary**
The 2016 Toyota Hiace, while generally reliable, does have a few common issues to watch out for. Excessive oil consumption on the petrol engines, injector and DPF problems with the diesel engines, harsh shifting of the transmission, rear leaf spring sagging, central locking malfunctions, sliding door roller wear, and dashboard cracking are the most reported. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs, particularly concerning engine components. Addressing these problems promptly can prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's overall reliability and value.
