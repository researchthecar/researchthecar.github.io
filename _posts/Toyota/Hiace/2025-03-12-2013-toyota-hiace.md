The 2013 Toyota Hiace is a popular choice for commercial use and passenger transport, known for its reliability and spaciousness. Available engine options include the 2.7L gasoline engine (2TR-FE) producing around 118 kW (159 hp) and approximately 241 Nm (178 lb-ft) of torque, the 3.0L diesel engine (1KD-FTV), and a smaller 2.0L gasoline engine. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine and market. Owners often praise the Hiace for its durability, practicality, and cargo capacity. However, some common complaints include relatively basic interior features, limited driver comfort on longer journeys, and fuel economy, particularly with the gasoline engines.

**Engine**

**2.7L Gasoline (2TR-FE)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust in severe cases, indicating oil burning.
    * Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and use of higher viscosity oil may help. In severe cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Idling Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the engine has idling issues, such as unstable or rough idling, and in some cases, the engine stalls.
    * Solution: Check and replace the air filter, clean the throttle body, and check the mass airflow sensor (MAF). If the problem persists, check the fuel injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Diesel (1KD-FTV)**

* **Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Diesel injectors are prone to failure, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, increased fuel consumption, and black smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time for balanced performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, especially with frequent short journeys, leading to reduced engine power and increased fuel consumption. A warning light on the dashboard usually indicates the problem.
    * Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (either by driving at high speeds for an extended period or using a diagnostic tool) or, in severe cases, DPF replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough or delayed shifting, especially between certain gears. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may improve shifting. If the problem persists, valve body issues or worn clutches might be the cause, requiring a more extensive repair or transmission rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slippage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, where the engine revs up without properly engaging the next gear. This is a serious issue that can lead to major transmission damage.
    * Solution: Inspect transmission fluid for contamination and perform a fluid flush. If slipping persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement is needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Leaf Springs**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, sagging rear end, poor ride quality (bouncing or harshness), and potential for bottoming out, particularly when carrying heavy loads.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty leaf springs if the vehicle is frequently used for carrying heavy loads.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Shock Absorbers**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing after bumps, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Central locking system may intermittently fail, or one of the door locks may not operate properly.
    * Solution: Checking the wiring, connectors, and the actuator motors in the doors. Faulty actuator motors need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard, difficulty starting the engine, or a complete electrical failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding doors, sticking, or unusual noises. The rollers and tracks can wear or become misaligned.
    * Solution: Lubrication of the rollers and tracks. Realignment of the door. In severe cases, replacement of the rollers or tracks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced cooling performance or complete failure of the air conditioning system. This can be caused by refrigerant leaks, a faulty compressor, or a clogged condenser.
    * Solution: Recharge the AC system. Repair any refrigerant leaks. Replace the compressor or condenser if needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Toyota Hiace, while generally reliable, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption in the 2.7L gasoline engine and injector failure in the 3.0L diesel, can be relatively costly to repair. Transmission problems like rough shifting and slippage can also arise, particularly in the automatic transmission. Suspension issues like worn leaf springs and shock absorbers can affect ride quality and handling. Electrical issues such as central locking problems and alternator failures can also occur. Lastly, owners have also noted issues with the sliding door mechanism. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on the specific problem. Addressing these potential issues proactively through regular maintenance can help extend the life and reliability of the Hiace.
