The 2012 Toyota Hiace is a popular choice for commercial use and passenger transport, known for its reliability and spaciousness. Common engine options include the 2.7L inline-4 gasoline engine (around 118kW and 241Nm of torque) and the 3.0L inline-4 turbo diesel engine (around 100kW and 300Nm of torque). Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally praise the Hiace for its durability, practicality, and cargo capacity, while common complaints revolve around basic interior features, ride comfort, and fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine).
