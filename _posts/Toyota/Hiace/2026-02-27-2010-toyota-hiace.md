### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Toyota Hiace demonstrates excellent overall reliability, a hallmark of Toyota's commercial vehicle engineering. The diesel variants, particularly the 2.5L 1KD-FTV, are more prone to specific issues like turbocharger and injector problems, which are not uncommon for high-mileage diesel engines. The petrol engine and both transmission options are generally very robust. Suspension components and the electrical system (specifically the alternator) are the most likely areas for repair outside of routine maintenance. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate and maintenance. Despite these points, the Hiace remains a highly dependable workhorse with manageable repair costs for its class.
