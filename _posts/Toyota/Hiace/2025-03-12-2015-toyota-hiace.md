**Summary**

The 2015 Toyota Hiace, while generally reliable, can experience issues common to vans of its age and usage. Engine problems, particularly with fuel injectors and DPF clogging in diesel models, can be costly. Transmission issues, both in automatic and manual versions, require prompt attention to avoid extensive damage. Suspension wear is typical and relatively inexpensive to address. Electrical problems, though less frequent, can still occur and require diagnostic skills to resolve. Rust can be a concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Overall, while the Hiace has a reputation for dependability, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage.
