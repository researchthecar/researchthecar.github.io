The 2022 Toyota Hiace is a popular van known for its reliability, practicality, and spaciousness. It's often used for commercial purposes, such as transporting passengers or cargo. While highly regarded, some owners have reported experiencing specific issues. Engine options typically include a range of gasoline and diesel engines depending on the market. A common gasoline option is the 2.7L 2TR-FE four-cylinder engine, producing around 118 kW (159 hp) and 243 Nm (179 lb-ft) of torque. Some dislike its basic interior and relatively simple features compared to more modern vans, while owners often praise its dependability and cargo capacity.

**Engine**

**2.7L 2TR-FE Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 2TR-FE engine consumes more oil than expected, requiring frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust (indicating oil burning), and a noticeable decrease in oil level on the dipstick over a short period.
    *   Solution: Initially, monitor oil consumption closely. If excessive consumption is confirmed, potential fixes include replacing the piston rings, valve stem seals, or addressing other potential causes of oil leaks. In some cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity and the chosen solution (e.g., replacing valve stem seals vs. engine rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting between gears. This can be more noticeable during low-speed driving or when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: The issue may be related to low transmission fluid, a faulty shift solenoid, or a software issue with the transmission control module (TCM). Checking and replacing the transmission fluid, replacing faulty solenoids, or reflashing the TCM with updated software could resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the cause and parts replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, some owners have reported the rear suspension sagging, especially when carrying heavy loads. This can lead to a decreased ride height and compromised handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear leaf springs or adding helper springs can restore the ride height and improve load-carrying capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing issues with the infotainment system, such as freezing, crashing, or unresponsive touch screen.
    *   Solution: Software updates can often resolve these issues. If updating the software does not fix the problem, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1000+ (for replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficult to open or close the sliding door. The door may also make a loud noise when opening or closing.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the tracks and rollers. Replacing the door rollers or the entire sliding door mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+ depending on the parts replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling noises coming from the dashboard or trim panels, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattling and tightening any loose trim pieces. Adding foam or felt padding behind panels can help dampen vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if DIY) - $200+ (if professionally addressed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Toyota Hiace is generally a reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with engine oil consumption, transmission shifting, suspension sagging, infotainment system glitches, and interior noises. The severity of these issues can vary, and the cost to fix them can range from minor repairs to more substantial expenses. The excessive oil consumption and transmission issues are potentially the most concerning, while the other issues are typically less critical.
