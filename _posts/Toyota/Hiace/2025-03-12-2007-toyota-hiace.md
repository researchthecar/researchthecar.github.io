The 2007 Toyota Hiace is a versatile and reliable van popular for commercial and personal use. It offers a spacious interior, dependable engine, and good fuel economy for its class. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. Dislikes often include the basic interior features, ride quality (especially when unladen), and limited availability of some parts depending on the region. The Australian market typically had the 2.7L 2TR-FE Inline-4 Petrol engine, and the 3.0L 1KD-FTV Inline-4 Turbo Diesel engine. Power figures for the 2.7L are roughly 118kW (158 hp) and 241Nm (178 lb-ft) of torque. The 3.0L Diesel produces roughly 80kW (107 hp) and 260Nm (192 lb-ft) of torque. Available transmissions include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic.
