**Introduction:**

The 2017 Toyota Prius is a compact hybrid sedan known for its fuel efficiency, eco-friendliness, and advanced technology. It comes standard with a 1.8L 4-cylinder gasoline engine mated to an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). Optional powertrain options include a 1.8L 4-cylinder gasoline engine paired with an ECVT and an electric motor for hybrid operation and a plug-in hybrid powertrain with a 1.8L 4-cylinder gasoline engine, an ECVT, and a larger battery pack.

The Prius has received praise for its exceptional fuel economy, roomy interior, and sleek styling. However, it has also faced criticism for its bland driving dynamics, limited rear cargo space, and occasional reliability issues.
