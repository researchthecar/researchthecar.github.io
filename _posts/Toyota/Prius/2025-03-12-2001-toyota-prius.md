The 2001 Toyota Prius marked a significant step in hybrid vehicle technology. It was powered by a 1.5L Inline-4 engine paired with a hybrid electric drive system, producing a combined 72 horsepower and 82 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally praised its fuel efficiency and innovative technology for its time. Common dislikes included the somewhat unconventional styling and the limited performance compared to traditional gasoline vehicles.

**Electric Motor**

**1.5L Inline-4 Hybrid Electric System**

*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hybrid inverter, responsible for converting DC power from the battery to AC power for the motor, can fail. Symptoms include warning lights (often the master warning light or hybrid system warning light), reduced power, and potential inability to start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the inverter assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Degradation of the nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery pack is a common issue as the vehicle ages. Symptoms include reduced fuel economy, decreased power, frequent engine cycling, and a "check hybrid system" warning light. The battery ECU can also fail, causing the hybrid battery to be unable to charge or discharge properly.
    *   Solution: Battery pack replacement or individual module replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ for full replacement, $200 - $500+ per module for individual replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Transaxle Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transaxle bearings can wear out, leading to noise (whining or grinding) and potential transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Transaxle rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear strut mounts can deteriorate, causing a clunking noise from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Combination Meter (Dashboard Display) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The combination meter, which displays speed, fuel level, and other critical information, can experience segment failures or complete loss of display.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the combination meter assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor resistor can fail, leading to the blower motor only working on certain speeds or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary:** The 2001 Toyota Prius faces several age-related issues, primarily revolving around the hybrid system (inverter, battery), transaxle, and electrical components. The most significant potential expenses are associated with hybrid battery and inverter replacement, potentially costing several thousand dollars. Other issues like combination meter and suspension component failures are less severe but still require attention. While these issues can be costly, addressing them promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and efficiency.
