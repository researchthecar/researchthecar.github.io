The 2002 Toyota Prius marked the beginning of the second generation and brought a more aerodynamic design, improved fuel economy, and increased power. It came with a 1.5L four-cylinder engine paired with Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system, delivering a combined 72 horsepower and 82 lb-ft of torque. People often liked the Prius for its excellent fuel economy and reliability. Common complaints included the car's somewhat lackluster performance and the early hybrid battery degradation issues.

**Electric Motor**

**1.5L Hybrid Synergy Drive**
*   **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, warning lights on the dashboard (typically the master warning light, battery light, or hybrid system light), diminished acceleration, and eventual inability to start the vehicle. The high-voltage battery pack degrades over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack. Some owners opt for refurbished or aftermarket battery packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Combination Meter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete or intermittent failure of the instrument cluster, including the speedometer, fuel gauge, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the combination meter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inverter Coolant Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating of the inverter. The coolant pump circulates coolant through the inverter to regulate its temperature. A failing pump can cause the inverter to overheat and trigger warning lights.
    * Solution: Replace the coolant pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Multi-Function Display (MFD) Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LCD screen in the center console that displays energy flow, climate control settings, and other information may experience pixel damage, fading, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MFD screen or entire MFD unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2002 Toyota Prius is generally reliable, but owners should be aware of potential hybrid battery degradation. The battery repair can be costly, but other issues such as the combination meter, inverter coolant pump, and MFD screen are less expensive to address.
