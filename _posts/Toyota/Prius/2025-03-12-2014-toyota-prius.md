The 2014 Toyota Prius is a popular hybrid vehicle known for its fuel efficiency and reliability. It's powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 134 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). Owners generally appreciate the Prius for its excellent gas mileage and longevity, but some dislike its somewhat bland styling and occasionally sluggish acceleration. Some common complaints include the infotainment system feeling dated and the road noise being noticeable at highway speeds.

**Engine**

**1.8L 2ZR-FXE Inline-4 Hybrid**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than usual. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings is a common fix. In severe cases, the entire engine may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks developing in the EGR cooler. Coolant may leak into the exhaust gas recirculation system which causes white smoke to come from the exhaust tailpipe.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ECVT (Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Inverter Coolant Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inverter coolant pump cools the hybrid system's inverter. Failure of this pump can cause the hybrid system to overheat and potentially shut down. Warning lights on the dash will appear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the inverter coolant pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Combination Meter Failure (Dashboard Display)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The combination meter, which displays speed, fuel level, and other information, can fail, leading to a blank or flickering screen.
    *   Solution: Replacing the combination meter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the hybrid battery's capacity can degrade, leading to reduced fuel economy and shorter electric-only driving range.
    *   Solution: Replacing or reconditioning the hybrid battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks from Hatchback Seal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported water leaks into the cargo area through the hatchback seal, especially during heavy rain.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hatchback seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard (expensive) or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Toyota Prius is generally a reliable vehicle, but some common issues include excessive oil consumption, inverter coolant pump failure, combination meter failure, and hybrid battery degradation. While some issues, like the EGR cooler failure, can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as engine replacement or hybrid battery replacement, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
