The 2018 Toyota Prius is a popular hybrid vehicle known for its exceptional fuel economy and reliability. It is equipped with a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine (2ZR-FXE) producing 95 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque paired with an electric motor, resulting in a combined 121 horsepower. All trims are equipped with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Prius for its fuel efficiency (over 50 MPG), spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Common complaints include lackluster acceleration and a somewhat uninspiring driving experience, although its efficiency and practicality offset these for many buyers.

**Electric Motor**

**1.8L 2ZR-FXE Engine and Electric Motor**
* **Inverter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The inverter, which converts DC power from the hybrid battery to AC power for the electric motor, can fail. Symptoms include warning lights, loss of power, and the vehicle may not start.
    * Solution: Replacing the inverter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time, the hybrid battery's capacity can degrade, leading to reduced fuel economy and performance. The vehicle may also display a "Check Hybrid System" warning.
    * Solution: Replacing or reconditioning the hybrid battery pack.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (replacement) $1,000 - $2,000 (reconditioning)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
* **Transmission Whine**

**Summary**

The 2018 Toyota Prius generally exhibits reliable performance, with the most significant concerns revolving around potential hybrid system issues, particularly the inverter and battery, which can be costly to repair. The CVT transmission whine and electrical issues like 12V battery drain are also notable. While some problems can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes, others, such as hybrid battery replacement, can be quite expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and inspect the vehicle thoroughly, especially the hybrid system, before purchasing.
