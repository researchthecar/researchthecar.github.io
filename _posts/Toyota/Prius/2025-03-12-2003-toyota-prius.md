The 2003 Toyota Prius was a groundbreaking hybrid vehicle known for its exceptional fuel economy and innovative technology. It features a 1.5L four-cylinder engine paired with Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system, producing a combined 110 horsepower. Many owners appreciate the Prius for its fuel efficiency and reliability. However, some dislike its unconventional styling and occasionally quirky driving dynamics.

**Electric Motor**

**Hybrid Synergy Drive**
*   **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hybrid battery pack, responsible for storing and delivering energy to the electric motor, can degrade over time, especially in older models like the 2003 Prius. Symptoms include reduced fuel economy, warning lights on the dashboard (e.g., master warning light, hybrid system warning), decreased acceleration, and the engine running more frequently to compensate for the weak battery.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack. Some owners opt for refurbished batteries as a more affordable option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+ depending on whether it's a new or refurbished battery.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inverter converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the electric motor. Failure can result in the car not starting, warning lights, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the inverter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Hybrid Synergy Drive (CVT)**
*   **Transaxle Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transaxle in the 2003 Prius, which combines the functions of a traditional transmission and differential, can experience bearing failure. Symptoms include unusual noises (whining or grinding) from the transaxle area, especially at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the transaxle, which is a complex and costly repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear shock absorbers can wear out and leak, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Combination Meter (Dashboard Display) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The combination meter, which houses the speedometer, fuel gauge, and other important indicators, is prone to failure in early Prius models. Symptoms include flickering, dimming, or complete loss of display.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the combination meter. Repair options are available, but replacement is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The auxiliary 12V battery, which is used to start the car and power accessories, can drain prematurely, especially if it's old or if there's a parasitic draw in the electrical system. Symptoms include difficulty starting the car, especially in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery. Diagnose and repair any parasitic draws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement; diagnostic costs vary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuator controls the flow of hot and cold air. Failure can result in the inability to control the temperature, with air blowing either hot or cold regardless of the setting. Clicking noises from the dashboard are also common.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Toyota Prius, while groundbreaking, has its share of common issues. The most significant are related to the hybrid system, including battery and inverter failures, which can be quite expensive to repair. Other electrical issues like the combination meter failure are also prevalent. Suspension issues are less severe but can impact ride quality. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchase decision.
