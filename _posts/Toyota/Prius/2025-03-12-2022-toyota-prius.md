The 2022 Toyota Prius is a popular hybrid vehicle known for its exceptional fuel economy and reliability. It comes standard with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 121 horsepower and 120 lb-ft of torque. A key selling point is its impressive fuel efficiency, often exceeding 50 MPG in combined driving. Drivers often appreciate the Prius's quiet ride and comfortable interior. Common complaints often revolve around its somewhat uninspired driving dynamics and the dated interior design.
