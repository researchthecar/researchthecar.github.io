## Engine

### 1.5L Hybrid Synergy Drive (1NZ-FXE)
**Inverter Cooling Pump Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Overheating of the hybrid inverter, leading to reduced power or shutdown of the hybrid system. Often accompanied by a dashboard warning light.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the inverter cooling pump.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Hybrid Battery Degradation**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced fuel economy, decreased acceleration, and the hybrid system may not engage as readily. Dashboard warning lights related to the hybrid system may illuminate.
- **Solution:** Hybrid battery pack replacement. Reconditioning or replacement with a new/remanufactured unit.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $4,000


## Transmission

### Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT)
**No widespread issues reported.**
- **Symptoms:** N/A
- **Solution:** N/A
- **Cost:** Varies


## Suspension

### Standard Independent Suspension
**No widespread issues reported.**
- **Symptoms:** N/A
- **Solution:** N/A
- **Cost:** Varies


## Electrical

### Hybrid System Electronics
**12V Auxiliary Battery Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Difficulty starting the vehicle, flickering dashboard lights, or complete electrical system failure. This battery powers the vehicle's computers and systems before the hybrid battery engages.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the 12V auxiliary battery.
- **Cost:** $150 - $300


### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Gremlins**
- **Symptoms:** Unpredictable behavior of various electrical components such as power windows, door locks, or interior lights. Can be difficult to diagnose.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Exterior

### Body Panels and Seals
**No widespread issues reported.**
- **Symptoms:** N/A
- **Solution:** N/A
- **Cost:** Varies


## Interior

### HVAC System
**HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** No air coming from the vents or intermittent fan operation. This affects both heating and cooling.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the HVAC blower motor.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


### Dashboard Displays
**Pixelated or Dim Display**
- **Symptoms:** The multi-information display (MID) or other dashboard screens may show missing pixels or become dim, making them hard to read.
- **Solution:** Repair or replacement of the affected display unit.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Toyota Prius is a remarkably reliable vehicle, especially considering its advanced hybrid technology for its era. The primary concerns revolve around the hybrid system's inverter cooling pump and the eventual degradation of the hybrid battery pack, which are significant but expected for a hybrid of this age. The 12V auxiliary battery is a common replacement item. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM, can be sporadic. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor and dashboard displays are also potential points of failure. Overall, the core powertrain remains robust, making it a solid choice for those seeking an economical and environmentally conscious vehicle, provided these specific hybrid-related components are addressed or factored into ownership costs.
