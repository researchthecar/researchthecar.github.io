The primary concerns revolve around the longevity of the hybrid battery pack and, less commonly, the inverter, which are significant but expected for a vehicle of this age and technology. The conventional engine and transmission systems are generally robust. Electrical issues, particularly with the 12V auxiliary battery and hybrid system cooling fans, are also noted. Despite these potential repairs, the overall cost of ownership remains competitive due to the excellent fuel economy and the general durability of the Prius platform.
