The 2024 Toyota Prius is a popular hybrid vehicle known for its fuel efficiency and reliability. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 194 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque. An all-wheel-drive version is available that produces 196 horsepower. It features a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise its updated sleek design, comfortable ride, and excellent gas mileage. Some common complaints include limited rear headroom due to the car's sloping roofline, and the infotainment system's reliance on touch controls.

**Summary:**

The 2024 Toyota Prius presents a mix of minor and potentially more significant issues. Electrical problems, such as infotainment system glitches and connectivity concerns, appear to be relatively common, with repair costs ranging from minimal (software updates) to moderate (head unit replacement). Windshield Cracking can be concerning but is also moderately expensive. Interior rattles and seat noises, while often minor annoyances, can be time-consuming to diagnose and fix. CVT hesitation is reported and may need service. While no widespread, major mechanical failures have emerged, potential buyers should be aware of these reported issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle, especially the infotainment system and interior components, before purchasing.
