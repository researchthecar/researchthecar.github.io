The 2009 Toyota Prius is a hybrid electric vehicle, known for its exceptional fuel economy. It comes standard with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine (76 hp, 82 lb-ft of torque) paired with an electric motor, combining for a total system output of 110 horsepower. People generally appreciate the Prius for its fuel efficiency and reliability, but common complaints include a somewhat bland driving experience and a less-than-premium interior.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**
*   **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, warning lights on the dashboard (often a triangle with an exclamation point, or a battery symbol), decreased acceleration, and in some cases, complete failure of the hybrid system preventing the car from starting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack. Some owners opt for refurbished batteries, while others choose new ones.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+ depending on new vs. refurbished and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**
*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden loss of power, inability to accelerate, warning lights illuminate, and potential complete shutdown of the vehicle. This is related to the inverter, which converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the electric motor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the inverter assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls:
        *   Recall Number: 01V017000
        *   Recall Date: 20010208
        *   Component: Power Train: Automatic Transmission
        *   Potential Number of Units Affected: 416000
        *   Summary: On certain vehicles, the transmission shift lever cable was improperly adjusted which could cause the cable to separate from the shift lever assembly. If the shift lever cable separated from the shift lever assembly, the driver may not be able to shift the transmission. In addition, the transmission could be in a different gear than the position indicated on the shift lever. These conditions could cause a crash without warning.
        *   Corrective Action: Dealers will inspect and adjust the transmission shift lever cable on affected vehicles.

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded with passengers or cargo. This can lead to a harsher ride and potential tire wear issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs or installation of aftermarket load-assisting springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Combination Meter Failure (Dashboard Display)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The digital display on the dashboard, which includes the speedometer and other vital information, may become dim, flicker, or fail completely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the combination meter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **12V Auxiliary Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery, responsible for starting the car's systems, can fail prematurely, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, or complete failure to start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V auxiliary battery. It is important to use the correct type of battery designed for hybrid vehicles.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture build-up inside the headlight housings, causing reduced visibility and potential damage to the headlight bulbs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headlight housings or attempting to seal the existing housings to prevent moisture intrusion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard material, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard, or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Toyota Prius, while known for its fuel efficiency, has several common issues that owners should be aware of. The most significant issues are related to the hybrid system, particularly the hybrid battery and inverter, which can be expensive to repair. Electrical issues like combination meter failure and 12V battery problems are also common. Suspension and interior issues can also contribute to the overall ownership experience. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, the potential for costly hybrid system repairs makes it important to thoroughly inspect a used 2009 Prius before purchase.
