The 2006 Toyota Prius is a hybrid electric vehicle known for its exceptional fuel economy and reliability. It's powered by a 1.5L 4-cylinder gasoline engine producing 76 horsepower and 82 lb-ft of torque, coupled with a 50 kW electric motor. The combined system output is 110 horsepower. The Prius utilizes a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Prius for its fuel efficiency (averaging around 45-50 MPG), quiet cabin, and low running costs. Common complaints include a somewhat uninspiring driving experience, limited cargo space, and the initial cost of battery replacement.
