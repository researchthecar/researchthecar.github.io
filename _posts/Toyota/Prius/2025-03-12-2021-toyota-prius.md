The 2021 Toyota Prius is a popular hybrid vehicle known for its exceptional fuel efficiency and reliability. It comes standard with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 121 horsepower and 120 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate the Prius for its fuel economy and dependability, while others find its acceleration and driving dynamics to be uninspiring.
