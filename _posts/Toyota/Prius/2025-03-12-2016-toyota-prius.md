The 2016 Toyota Prius is a popular hybrid vehicle known for its excellent fuel economy and reliability. It comes equipped with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a hybrid system that delivers a combined 121 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. The Prius uses an Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). While lauded for its fuel efficiency and smooth ride, some owners have reported issues with various components, including the electrical system, interior features, and some aspects of the hybrid system. Some drivers dislike the exterior styling and the somewhat lethargic acceleration.
