The 2012 Toyota Prius is a popular hybrid vehicle known for its exceptional fuel economy. Powered by a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine (98 hp and 105 lb-ft of torque) paired with a hybrid system, it delivers a combined 134 horsepower. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is standard. Owners often praise the Prius for its fuel efficiency and reliability, while some dislike its somewhat bland driving experience and occasionally quirky interior.

**Electric Motor**

**Hybrid Electric Motor**
*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hybrid inverter, which converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the electric motor, can fail. Symptoms include warning lights on the dashboard (specifically the master warning light and hybrid system warning light), reduced power, and in some cases, the car may not start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid inverter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: Some units are covered under recall number 14V-531 due to potential for thermal damage. This recall only applies to certain VIN ranges, so check Toyota's recall database.

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**

*   **Transmission Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A whining or buzzing noise from the transmission, especially at higher speeds. This can be a sign of bearing wear within the CVT.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid change might temporarily alleviate the noise. However, the long-term solution often involves a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Brakes**

*   **Brake Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The brake actuator, part of the regenerative braking system, can fail. Symptoms include reduced braking power, longer stopping distances, and warning lights related to the braking system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the brake actuator assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: Some brake booster assemblies are covered under recall 18V686000 due to potential failure of the brake booster pump assembly.

**Electrical**

*   **Combination Meter Failure (Dashboard Display)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The combination meter, which displays speed, fuel level, and other vital information, can fail or become unreadable. The display might flicker, become dim, or show incorrect information.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the combination meter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor resistor controls the fan speed for the heating and air conditioning system. Failure can result in the blower motor only working on one speed (usually high) or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Auxiliary (12V) Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery, used to start the car's electronics, can fail prematurely. Symptoms include difficulty starting the car, warning lights, and issues with the car's electronic systems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the auxiliary battery. It is recommended to use a specific AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) type battery designed for hybrids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking/Melting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In certain climates with high heat and sun exposure, the dashboard material can crack, become sticky, or even melt.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or use of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ for dashboard replacement. Dashboard covers are much cheaper.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation.
    *   Solution: Removal and drying of the headlight housings, resealing the housings, or replacement of the headlight assemblies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per headlight depending on the repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Toyota Prius is generally reliable, but some common issues include inverter failure, brake actuator problems, dashboard cracking, and combination meter malfunctions. The inverter failure can be costly. While some components are covered by recall, many are not, making it essential to inspect these areas when purchasing a used 2012 Prius. Most of the severe issues can cost between $1,000 to $5,000 to fix.
