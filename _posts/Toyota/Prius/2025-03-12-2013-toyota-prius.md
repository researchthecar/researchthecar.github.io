The 2013 Toyota Prius is a popular hybrid vehicle known for its exceptional fuel economy and reliability. It's powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine (98 hp, 105 lb-ft of torque) paired with an electric motor, resulting in a combined output of 134 horsepower. The Prius uses an Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). While praised for its fuel efficiency, some owners find the acceleration and handling to be less engaging. Common complaints include road noise and the design of the interior.

**Summary:**

The 2013 Toyota Prius, while generally reliable, can experience issues such as excessive oil consumption, EGR cooler failures, and hybrid battery problems. Electrical issues, such as inverter and combination meter failures, can also occur. Suspension noises and dashboard cracking are common complaints as well. Repair costs range from a few hundred dollars for minor suspension work to several thousand for major repairs like engine or hybrid battery replacements. While there are some concerns, the Prius is generally a reliable vehicle that can last a long time if cared for properly.
