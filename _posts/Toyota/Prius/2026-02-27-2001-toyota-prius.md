# 2001 Toyota Prius

### Overview
The 2001 Toyota Prius, a pioneer in hybrid technology, is generally recognized for its strong reliability, particularly in its powertrain. As one of the first mass-produced hybrid vehicles, it laid the groundwork for future models. While its advanced hybrid system was innovative for its time, it has proven to be remarkably robust. Owners often praise its fuel efficiency and low running costs. However, like any vehicle of this age, certain components may show wear, and specific attention should be paid to the hybrid battery and inverter, though widespread catastrophic failures are uncommon for its age. The overall build quality contributes to its enduring appeal.

### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Toyota Prius is a remarkably reliable vehicle, especially considering its age and pioneering hybrid technology. The core powertrain (engine and eCVT) is exceptionally durable. The primary areas of concern, as with most hybrids of this generation, are the hybrid battery pack and the inverter, which can degrade or fail over time and represent the most significant potential repair costs. The 12V auxiliary battery also has a typical lifespan. Other components like suspension, exterior, and interior generally hold up well, with only minor issues like headlight condensation or HVAC blower motor failure being somewhat common. Overall, it remains a dependable choice for those seeking fuel efficiency, but potential buyers should be aware of the hybrid-specific component costs.
