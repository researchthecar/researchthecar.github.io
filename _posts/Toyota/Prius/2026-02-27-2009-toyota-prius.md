### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Toyota Prius is a highly reliable vehicle, particularly for its powertrain. The primary concerns revolve around the longevity of the hybrid battery pack and, less commonly, the inverter/converter, which are expensive but expected for a hybrid of this age. The 1.5L hybrid engine and eCVT transmission are generally robust. Other systems like suspension, exterior, and interior components are typically trouble-free. Owners should be aware of the potential for hybrid battery degradation as the vehicle approaches or exceeds 100,000 miles, but overall, it remains a dependable choice with excellent fuel economy.
