The 2007 Toyota Prius is a hybrid electric vehicle known for its exceptional fuel economy. It's powered by a 1.5L 4-cylinder engine (76 hp and 82 lb-ft of torque) coupled with an electric motor that boosts the total output to 110 hp. The Prius uses an Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). Owners often praise the Prius for its fuel efficiency and reliability, but some common complaints include battery degradation over time and certain mechanical issues.

**Electric Motor**

**Hybrid Synergy Drive**
*   **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, warning lights on the dashboard (e.g., check engine light, hybrid system warning), decreased acceleration, and eventual inability to start the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack. Some owners opt for refurbished or aftermarket batteries, while others prefer a new OEM battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the source (new, refurbished, aftermarket) and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights, loss of power, vehicle stalling, and potentially complete failure to start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the inverter assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+ depending on the source and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT)**
*   **Transmission Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining sound, particularly at higher speeds, emanating from the transmission area. It does not necessarily affect the function of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: In some instances, fluid changes can help, but the issue often requires professional diagnosis to determine the cause. If the noise gets worse, it may require a full replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the car sits noticeably lower than the front. This can cause a bumpy ride and potentially affect handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers or the entire rear suspension assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Combination Meter Failure (Dashboard Display)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The digital display on the dashboard, which shows speed, fuel level, and other vital information, can fail or become dim.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the combination meter or repair of the faulty components within the unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ depending on whether it's repaired or replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Brake Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This electronic component affects braking. The repair can result in complete loss of braking power. Warning lights illuminate on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the brake actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the source and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing, causing reduced visibility.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlights or attempting to seal the existing headlights to prevent moisture intrusion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on if you replace the headlights.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in hot climates, due to sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (for a cover) - $1,500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Toyota Prius is a generally reliable vehicle but is prone to some common issues. The most significant concerns are related to the hybrid battery, inverter, and brake actuator, which can be quite expensive to repair. Other issues, like suspension sagging and combination meter failure, can also add to the ownership cost. While the Prius offers excellent fuel economy, potential buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs.
