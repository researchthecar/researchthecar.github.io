The 2022 Toyota Corolla Cross is a compact crossover SUV that offers a blend of practicality, fuel efficiency, and Toyota's renowned reliability. The Corolla Cross comes standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 169 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Some owners appreciate its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and user-friendly technology. Common criticisms include its somewhat uninspired driving dynamics and occasionally noisy engine under hard acceleration.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. The amount of oil consumed varies.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. Some owners have had success with switching to a different brand or viscosity of oil. In severe cases, a dealer may perform an oil consumption test to determine if further repairs are necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the cause. Could range from switching oil brands at personal expense, to potentially engine work covered under warranty if deemed excessive by Toyota.

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or jerking sensations during acceleration, particularly from a stop or at low speeds. This can be described as a "rubber band" feeling, a common characteristic of some CVTs.
    *   Solution: This issue might be improved by a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) or a CVT fluid change. In some cases, the CVT unit itself may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update could be covered under warranty or cost around $100 - $200. CVT fluid change could be in the $200 - $400 range. CVT replacement would be significantly higher, potentially $4,000 - $7,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches/Freezing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced occasional glitches, freezes, or slow response times with the infotainment system. This can include issues with the touchscreen, navigation, and Bluetooth connectivity.
    *   Solution: Restarting the system may temporarily resolve the issue. Software updates from Toyota can sometimes address these problems. In some cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free (if done by the dealer). Infotainment unit replacement could range from $500 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may occasionally display a blank screen or distorted image. This can occur intermittently or become a persistent problem.
    *   Solution: Checking the camera connections and wiring may resolve the issue. A software update may also be available. In some cases, the camera itself needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Wiring repair could be $100 - $300. Camera replacement could range from $200 - $500+.

**Exterior**

*   **Loose or Detaching Trim Pieces**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of exterior trim pieces, such as those around the windows or wheel arches, becoming loose or detaching.
    *   Solution: Reattaching the trim piece with adhesive or clips. In some cases, replacement of the trim piece may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Reattaching could be $50 - $150. Trim piece replacement could range from $100 - $400+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling noises coming from various areas within the cabin, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Locating and securing the source of the rattle. This may involve tightening loose screws, adding padding or insulation, or replacing damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Depends on the source and complexity. Simple fixes could be $50 - $150. More involved repairs could be $200 - $500+.

**Summary**

Overall, the 2022 Toyota Corolla Cross appears to be a reasonably reliable vehicle, although some owners have reported issues with the transmission, electrical systems, and interior. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some being relatively minor and inexpensive to resolve, while others may require more extensive and costly repairs.
