**Introduction**

The 2022 Toyota Corolla Cross is a compact crossover SUV offered with two engine and transmission options: a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with a CVT (continuously variable transmission) and a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 2.0-liter engine produces 169 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.5-liter engine produces 171 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque. The Corolla Cross is praised for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and advanced safety features. However, it has also received criticism for its lackluster performance and uninspiring cabin design.
