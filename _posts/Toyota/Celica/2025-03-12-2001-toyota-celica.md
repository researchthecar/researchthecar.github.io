The 2001 Toyota Celica is a sporty coupe known for its sleek design and responsive handling. It was offered with two engine options: a 1.8L 4-cylinder 1ZZ-FE engine producing 120 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, and a higher-performance 1.8L 4-cylinder 2ZZ-GE engine producing 180 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual (only with the 2ZZ-GE), and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Celica's sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and distinctive styling. Some common complaints include limited rear passenger space and a sometimes harsh ride quality.

**Engine**

**1ZZ-FE (1.8L)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual increase in oil consumption over time, requiring frequent oil top-offs. This is a common issue with the 1ZZ-FE engine due to piston ring design. Visible blue smoke may appear from the exhaust pipe.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

*   **Pre-Cat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter (integrated into the exhaust manifold) can fail, causing debris to be sucked back into the engine, potentially damaging the cylinder walls and piston rings. Symptoms include decreased engine performance, increased emissions, and a rattling sound from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifold with an updated design that removes the pre-cat, or replacing the engine if damage is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (manifold replacement), $3,000+ (engine replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**2ZZ-GE (1.8L)**

*   **Oil Starvation at High RPMs (Early Models)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2ZZ-GE engine, especially in early models, can experience oil starvation at high RPMs, particularly during sustained track use or aggressive driving. This can lead to bearing failure and engine damage.
    *   Solution: Installing an upgraded oil pump or an Accusump oil accumulator system to ensure adequate oil pressure at high RPMs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve springs can fail, especially at high RPMs. The valve train can make extra noise when the engine runs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit delayed engagement when shifting between gears, or experience harsh, jerky shifts. This can be caused by worn valve body components or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush, replacing the valve body, or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid flush), $500 - $1,500+ (valve body), $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**
*   **Grinding/Popping Out of Gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Can happen while shifting quickly or at higher RPMs
    *   Solution: The transmission will likely need to be rebuilt or replaced
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**
*   **Grinding/Popping Out of Gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Can happen while shifting quickly or at higher RPMs
    *   Solution: The transmission will likely need to be rebuilt or replaced
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll in corners, and increased stopping distance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replacing the sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure of gauges, dim or flickering display.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, rough idling, and failed emissions test.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

**Exterior**

*   **Spoiler Cracking/Fading (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks in the spoiler, particularly around the mounting points. Fading or discoloration of the spoiler finish due to sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the spoiler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

*   **Antenna Mast Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: The antenna may be bent or fully broken.
    * Solution: Replacing the antenna mast.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Lid Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The latch that secures the center console lid breaks, preventing the lid from staying closed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the center console lid or the latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+

**Summary**

The 2001 Toyota Celica, while a stylish and fun-to-drive car, has some common issues. The most serious issues involve the 1ZZ-FE engine's oil consumption and pre-cat failure, which can be costly to repair. The 2ZZ-GE engine has potential oil starvation issues in early models at high RPMs, along with valve spring failure. Other common problems include worn suspension components, electrical issues, and interior trim issues. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, engine or transmission work can be significant. Potential buyers should have these issues inspected before purchasing a 2001 Celica.
