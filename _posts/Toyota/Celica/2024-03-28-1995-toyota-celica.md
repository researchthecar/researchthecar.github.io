## 1995 Toyota Celica

The 1995 Toyota Celica is a compact sports coupe that was available in both ST and GT trims. The ST trim came standard with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that produced 125 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, while the GT trim came standard with a 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine that produced 180 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a five-speed manual transmission, while a four-speed automatic transmission was optional on the ST trim.

The Celica was praised for its sporty handling, responsive steering, and comfortable interior. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, particularly in the ST trim.
