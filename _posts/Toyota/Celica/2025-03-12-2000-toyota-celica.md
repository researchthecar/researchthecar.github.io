The 2000 Toyota Celica is a sporty front-wheel-drive coupe known for its sleek styling and nimble handling. Two engine options were available: the 1.8L 1ZZ-FE inline-4 producing 120 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, and the higher-performance 1.8L 2ZZ-GE inline-4 found in the GT-S trim, delivering 180 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, with the GT-S also offering a 6-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the Celica's fuel efficiency, sporty appearance, and reliability. Common complaints include the relatively low power output of the base engine, road noise, and the age-related wear and tear that affects many vehicles of this vintage.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FE**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs. This can lead to spark plug fouling, catalytic converter damage, and eventual engine failure if left unaddressed. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Performing an oil consumption test to confirm the issue is the first step. Replacing the piston rings or replacing the engine is needed to fix it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Pre-Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter, located in the exhaust manifold, can disintegrate and send debris into the engine, causing damage. Symptoms include decreased performance, unusual noises, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold with an aftermarket header or install a new manifold with an updated pre-catalytic converter design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.8L 2ZZ-GE**
*   **VVTL-i System Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Valve Timing and Lift Intelligent system (VVTL-i) may fail to engage properly, resulting in a significant loss of power above 6000 RPM. This can be caused by low oil levels, a faulty VVTL-i oil control valve, or damaged rocker arms.
    *   Solution: Check oil levels and top off if necessary. Replace the VVTL-i oil control valve or damaged rocker arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Starvation Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2ZZ-GE engine is known to experience oil starvation under hard cornering or during prolonged high-RPM driving, especially with low oil levels. This can lead to engine damage, including spun bearings.
    *   Solution: Maintain proper oil levels at all times. Consider installing an aftermarket baffled oil pan to prevent oil sloshing and ensure consistent oil pressure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ (depending on the extent of engine damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**
*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit delayed engagement when shifting from park or neutral into drive or reverse. Harsh or erratic shifting between gears can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the solenoids or replace the whole transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Worn strut mounts can cause clunking noises, especially when going over bumps. This can also affect the vehicle's handling and alignment.
    * Solution: Replace the strut mounts. It's generally recommended to replace the struts at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: The bushings in the control arms can wear out over time, leading to play in the suspension and causing noises, especially during acceleration or braking.
    * Solution: Replace the control arm bushings or the entire control arm.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oxygen sensors can fail, leading to a check engine light, poor fuel economy, and rough running.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator may fail, resulting in a dead battery, dimming headlights, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Spoiler Cracking or Fading (GT-S Models)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The spoiler on GT-S models may develop cracks or fade due to exposure to sunlight and weather.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the spoiler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks, especially in hot climates, due to sun exposure and aging.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver's Side Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The driver's side window may stop working or operate intermittently due to a failing window motor.
    *   Solution: Replace the window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Toyota Celica, while generally reliable, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, especially oil consumption with the 1ZZ-FE and potential VVTL-i problems with the 2ZZ-GE, can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical issues are fairly standard for a vehicle of this age. Interior problems like dashboard cracking are common, while exterior issues are mostly cosmetic. Overall, while the severity of these issues varies, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and be prepared for some maintenance and repairs.
