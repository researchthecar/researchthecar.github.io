The 2003 Toyota Celica is a sporty coupe known for its sleek design and handling. It was available with two engine options: a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder 1ZZ-FE engine producing 140 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a higher-performance 1.8-liter 4-cylinder 2ZZ-GE engine found in the GT-S model, which produced 180 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. The 1ZZ-FE engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 2ZZ-GE engine was mated to a 6-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. People appreciate the Celica for its fuel efficiency (especially with the 1ZZ-FE), stylish looks, and fun driving dynamics. Common dislikes include the rear seats being too small for adults, and some finding the base model underpowered.

**Engine**

**1ZZ-FE (1.8L) Engine**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often noticeable between oil changes. May lead to engine knocking or damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Replacing piston rings or engine replacement if the damage is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Pre-cat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter located in the exhaust manifold can degrade and disintegrate, sending debris into the engine, leading to engine damage. Symptoms include reduced engine performance, and potentially engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold (including the pre-cat) and potentially engine repair or replacement depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2ZZ-GE (1.8L) Engine**

*   **Lift Bolt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "lift bolts" on the rocker arms, which engage the higher-lift cam profile at higher RPMs (around 6000 RPM), can shear or break. This results in a loss of power at high RPMs, and the engine will not rev beyond a certain point (usually around 6000 RPM).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lift bolts with updated, stronger bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often noticeable between oil changes. May lead to engine knocking or damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Replacing piston rings or engine replacement if the damage is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**C56 5-Speed Manual Transmission (1ZZ-FE)**
*   No Issues Found

**C60 6-Speed Manual Transmission (2ZZ-GE)**
*   No Issues Found

**A245E 4-Speed Automatic Transmission (1ZZ-FE and 2ZZ-GE)**
*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips, hesitates, or shifts harshly between gears. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold or under load.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush could resolve the issue, but a transmission rebuild or replacement is likely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking, clunking, or rattling noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning. Visible cracks or deterioration of the strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts. It is recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dim Headlights**
    * Description/Symptoms: Headlights appear dimmer than usual, affecting visibility at night. Can be caused by corroded grounds, faulty headlight bulbs, or a failing alternator.
    * Solution: Inspect and clean ground connections, replace headlight bulbs with new ones (consider upgrading to brighter bulbs), and test the alternator output. Replace the alternator if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminates, poor fuel economy, rough idling, or failed emissions test.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor. Ensure the replacement sensor is compatible with the vehicle's specifications.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Spoiler Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory spoiler, particularly on the GT-S models, is prone to developing cracks over time. This is especially true in areas with high sun exposure or extreme temperature changes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the spoiler. Aftermarket options are available, or the original spoiler can be repaired and repainted.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard, or installation of a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Center Console Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The latch on the center console compartment can break, making it difficult to keep the console closed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the latch mechanism or the entire center console.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Toyota Celica has several common issues, with the most significant being related to engine oil consumption and potential pre-cat failure in the 1ZZ-FE engine and lift bolt failure and oil consumption in the 2ZZ-GE engine. These issues can lead to costly repairs if not addressed promptly. Other problems like strut mount failure and electrical issues are generally less expensive to fix. While the automatic transmission has been known to have issues, the manual transmissions appear to be reliable. Overall, the severity of the common issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potential engine damage, and the cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the problem and the extent of the damage.
