**Introduction**

The 2003 Toyota Celica is a sports coupe that was offered with two engine options: a 1.8L inline-4 producing 143 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L inline-4 producing 180 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

The Celica was praised for its agile handling, responsive steering, and sporty styling. However, it was also criticized for its cramped interior, lack of rear-seat legroom, and poor fuel economy.
