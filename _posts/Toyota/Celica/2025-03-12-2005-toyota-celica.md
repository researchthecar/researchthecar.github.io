The 2005 Toyota Celica is a sporty coupe known for its sharp handling and distinctive styling. It came with two engine options: the 1.8L 1ZZ-FE engine producing 140 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and the higher-performance 1.8L 2ZZ-GE engine producing 180 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual transmission (for the 1ZZ-FE) or a 6-speed manual transmission (standard on the 2ZZ-GE, optional on the 1ZZ-FE), as well as a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many Celica owners appreciate the car's fuel efficiency and sporty feel. However, some common complaints revolve around the small rear seats, road noise, and the relatively basic interior.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FE**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored closely. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings and potentially the pistons themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Pre-cat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter (integrated into the exhaust manifold) can break down, sending debris into the engine. This can cause engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifold with an aftermarket header or a redesigned manifold without the pre-cat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.8L 2ZZ-GE**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 1ZZ-FE, the 2ZZ-GE can also experience excessive oil consumption, particularly at higher RPMs associated with spirited driving. Blue smoke from the exhaust is an indicator.
    *   Solution: Replacing piston rings and potentially pistons, and addressing any valve guide wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Lift Bolt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The bolt holding the rocker arms for the VVTL-i (Variable Valve Timing and Lift - intelligent) system can shear or break. This results in a loss of high-RPM power as the high-lift cam profile is no longer engaged.
    *   Solution: Replacing the lift bolts with updated, stronger versions (often an aftermarket part).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**C56 5-Speed Manual (1ZZ-FE)**

*No Issues Found*

**C60 6-Speed Manual (2ZZ-GE, Optional on 1ZZ-FE)**

*   **Grinding or Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, particularly when cold, or grinding noises during gear changes. This is commonly seen in 2nd and 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn synchronizers and potentially other internal transmission components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**A245E 4-Speed Automatic (1ZZ-FE)**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking, clunking noises, or a generally loose feeling in the front suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or knocking sounds from the rear suspension, especially over bumps. Can also cause vague handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear trailing arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, poor fuel economy, and potentially rough idling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor (either upstream or downstream).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, difficulty starting, and a battery light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Spoiler Cracking/Fading**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or fading of the factory spoiler, especially on earlier models.
    *   Solution: Replacing or refinishing the spoiler.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Driver's Seat Rocking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The driver's seat rocks back and forth slightly, even when bolted down. This is due to wear in the seat frame or mounting points.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the seat frame or related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the severity and repair method.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Center Console Latch Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The latch for the center console breaks, preventing it from closing securely.
    *   Solution: Replacing the center console latch or the entire center console assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $150+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Toyota Celica, while a sporty and stylish car, can suffer from a few common issues. Oil consumption is the most concerning and potentially expensive problem, particularly for the 1ZZ-FE and 2ZZ-GE engines. The lift bolt issue on the 2ZZ-GE is relatively inexpensive to address proactively. Suspension and electrical problems are typical for a car of this age. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially major engine repairs, with repair costs varying accordingly. Thorough inspection and maintenance are key to keeping a 2005 Celica running reliably.
