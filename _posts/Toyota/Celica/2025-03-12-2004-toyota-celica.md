The 2004 Toyota Celica is a sporty coupe known for its distinctive styling and relatively affordable price point. It came with two engine options: the 1.8L 4-cylinder 1ZZ-FE engine producing 140 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque (found in the base Celica), and the higher-performing 1.8L 4-cylinder 2ZZ-GE engine with VVTL-i (Variable Valve Timing and Lift - intelligent) producing 180 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque (found in the Celica GT-S). Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual (base Celica), a 6-speed manual (GT-S Celica), or a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Celica for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and unique appearance. Common dislikes included the small rear seats and limited cargo space, as well as some engine issues.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FE**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 1ZZ-FE engine is prone to excessive oil consumption, especially as it ages. Symptoms include the need to add oil frequently between changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell. This can be caused by worn piston rings and cylinder walls.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild with new piston rings and potentially cylinder boring/sleeving or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.8L 2ZZ-GE**
*   **Lift Bolt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2ZZ-GE engine uses "lift bolts" in the valvetrain to engage the high-RPM valve lift system (VVTL-i). These bolts are prone to shearing or breaking, causing the high-RPM "lift" to stop functioning. The engine will lose power above approximately 6000 RPM.
    *   Solution: Replace the lift bolts with updated, stronger versions. Some owners also recommend replacing the valve springs at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**
*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the 4-speed automatic transmission, including delayed shifts, harsh shifts, or slipping between gears. This can be caused by worn clutch packs or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush, valve body rebuild or replacement, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the front strut mounts can result in clunking noises when driving over bumps. Degraded handling is also a possible symptom.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oxygen sensors can fail, leading to poor fuel economy, a check engine light, and potentially rough running.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Spoiler Cracking (GT-S Model)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear spoiler on the GT-S model is prone to cracking, especially around the mounting points.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the spoiler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100+ (repair) - $300+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks, particularly in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100+ (cover) - $1000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Toyota Celica is a generally reliable car, but owners should be aware of the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 1ZZ-FE engine and lift bolt failure in the 2ZZ-GE engine. Other issues, such as strut mount failures and oxygen sensor problems, are typical of cars of this age. The cost to fix these issues can range from relatively inexpensive (lift bolts, oxygen sensors) to quite expensive (engine rebuild). Overall, the Celica is a decent choice for a sporty and fuel-efficient car, but a pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
