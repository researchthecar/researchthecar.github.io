The 2002 Toyota Celica is a sporty coupe known for its fuel efficiency and distinctive styling. It was available with two engine options: the 1.8L 1ZZ-FE inline-four engine producing 140 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, found in the base model, and the higher-performance 1.8L 2ZZ-GE inline-four engine producing 180 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque, found in the GT-S model. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual (1ZZ-FE), 6-speed manual (2ZZ-GE), or a 4-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Celica's sporty handling and distinctive styling, while some common dislikes include the lack of low-end torque, particularly in the base model, and the relatively small interior space.

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often noticed as the car ages. Oil light may illuminate frequently, and engine damage can occur if oil levels are not checked and maintained.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and top-offs. In severe cases, piston ring replacement or engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Pre-Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter located in the exhaust manifold can fail, sending debris back into the engine and causing damage. Often indicated by rattling noises from the exhaust manifold and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold/pre-cat assembly.

**Summary**

The 2002 Toyota Celica has some common issues to watch out for, with the most significant being engine-related, particularly oil consumption and potential issues with the pre-catalytic converter (1ZZ-FE) or lift bolt (2ZZ-GE). Transmission issues with the automatic are also present. Suspension and electrical problems are less severe but should be considered. The cost to address these issues can vary widely depending on the severity and the specific part that needs to be replaced, but some repairs can be quite expensive. Regular maintenance and addressing issues promptly can help prevent more serious problems.
