## 1994 Toyota Tercel

The 1994 Toyota Tercel is a subcompact car that was available in two- and four-door sedan and four-door hatchback body styles. It came with a choice of two engines: a 1.5-liter inline-four with 70 horsepower and 79 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8-liter inline-four with 92 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission. The Tercel was praised for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and low cost, but it was criticized for its lack of power and dated interior.
