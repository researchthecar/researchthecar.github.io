The 2023 Toyota GR86 is a popular sports car known for its affordability, engaging driving dynamics, and lightweight design. It is available with a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated horizontally opposed (boxer) four-cylinder engine that produces 228 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the GR86's handling, steering feel, and overall fun-to-drive factor. Common dislikes include the somewhat noisy interior, and some consider the engine to lack low-end torque.

**Engine**

**2.4L Naturally Aspirated Boxer Four-Cylinder**

*   **Engine Oil Starvation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occurs under hard cornering or track use, particularly with lower oil levels. Can lead to engine damage, including rod knock or complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Ensure proper oil level is maintained (closer to full), consider using an oil baffle or improved oil pan design, and potentially upgrade to a higher-viscosity oil for track use. Some owners have preemptively replaced rod bearings as a preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the extent of the damage, from $200 for an oil pan baffle to $7,000+ for a complete engine replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Failure (Early Production Models)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Valve spring fractures leading to misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. Typically occurs at higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Valve spring replacement. Toyota released a TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) to address the issue. Some owners have reported the dealer will cover the cost if the car is under warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Grinding During Shifts (Especially 2nd to 3rd Gear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable grinding sound and difficulty engaging the next gear during aggressive or rapid shifts, more commonly between 2nd and 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with transmission fluid changes using high-quality synthetic fluids. Others have had the synchronizers replaced under warranty. In more severe cases, a complete transmission replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 for fluid change; $1,500 - $4,000+ for synchronizer or transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Downshifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable jolting or harshness during downshifts, particularly when coming to a stop.
    *   Solution: Some owners have reported the issue improves with a transmission control unit (TCU) reflash or fluid change. In some cases, it may be considered a characteristic of the transmission's programming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for TCU reflash or fluid change.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a restart.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealer.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Typically covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Sounds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or buzzing sounds emanating from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear deck.
    *   Solution: Identifying and isolating the source of the rattle, then using sound-deadening material or padding to eliminate it. This can be a DIY project or require professional assistance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY) - $500+ (professional sound deadening).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Toyota GR86 is a generally reliable sports car, but it does have some common issues to be aware of. The most serious concern is the potential for engine oil starvation under hard cornering, especially with the manual transmission model. Addressing this with proper oil level maintenance and potentially an upgraded oil pan is crucial. Other issues, such as valve spring failure, transmission grinding, and infotainment glitches, are less severe but can still be frustrating. The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for fluid changes to several thousand for engine or transmission replacements, depending on the severity of the problem. Potential buyers should have the car inspected thoroughly, especially if it has been tracked or driven aggressively.
