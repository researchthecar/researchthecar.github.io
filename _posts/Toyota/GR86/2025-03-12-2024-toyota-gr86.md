*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, particularly during break-in and in the first few thousand miles. This can manifest as the need to add oil between scheduled oil changes, or low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is recommended. Toyota has released Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) related to oil consumption on earlier models of the GR86/BRZ and may apply to some 2024 models. The TSB usually involves performing an oil consumption test and potential engine repairs or replacement depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if covered under warranty) - $5,000+ (for engine replacement if not covered under warranty)

**Summary**

The 2024 Toyota GR86 generally appears to be a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it can experience some issues. The most concerning reported issue is the potential for excessive oil consumption, which can lead to costly repairs if not addressed promptly and can potentially void warranties with aftermarket parts. There are also a few reports of issues related to the infotainment system and interior rattles. The recalls for fuel pump issues should be addressed promptly to ensure the car operates reliably. While these issues should be taken into consideration, the GR86 is generally well-regarded for its performance and value.
