**Summary**

The 2005 Toyota Sequoia is a reliable SUV but is susceptible to age-related issues. Engine issues such as exhaust manifold cracks and oil leaks are common but relatively manageable. Suspension problems, particularly with the optional air suspension, can be more costly. Rust on the frame is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winter conditions. While the severity of these issues varies, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and budget for necessary repairs. Estimated repair costs range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major repairs like frame work or transmission overhauls.
