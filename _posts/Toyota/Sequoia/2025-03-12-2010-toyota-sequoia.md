The 2010 Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, reliability, and towing capacity. Available engine options include the 4.6L V8 (310 hp, 327 lb-ft of torque) and the 5.7L V8 (381 hp, 401 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Sequoia's comfortable ride, large cargo area, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common complaints include fuel economy and overall size, which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may develop from the valve cover gaskets and/or the timing chain cover. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on location of leak and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L V8**
*   **Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The secondary air injection pump can fail, especially in colder climates. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough idling, and potential engine stalling. Error codes P0418, P2440, P2441, P2442, P2443, P2444, P2445, P2446, P2447, P2448, P2449, P0412 may also be present.

    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifolds are prone to cracking, leading to exhaust leaks. This can cause a ticking noise, especially upon cold start, and may trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on location of leak and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**
*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh shifting or slipping between gears, especially at higher mileage. This can be caused by worn valve body components or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush, and if the problem persists, replace the valve body or rebuild the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sequoias equipped with the rear air suspension can experience problems with the airbags leaking or the compressor failing. This can cause the rear of the vehicle to sag or ride harshly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty airbags or the air compressor. It is also possible to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (airbag/compressor replacement), $500-$1000+ (coil spring conversion)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door lock actuators can fail, causing the doors to not lock or unlock properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2010 Toyota Sequoia is a reliable SUV, but some common issues owners face include air injection pump failure, exhaust manifold cracking (especially with the 5.7L V8), oil leaks, and potential problems with the air suspension (if equipped). While some issues like oil leaks might be minor, others such as air injection pump failure can be more costly to repair. Addressing these potential issues proactively can help maintain the vehicle's longevity and reliability.
