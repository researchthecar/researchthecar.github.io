The 2008 Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, reliability, and towing capacity. The Sequoia was offered with two engine options: a 4.7L V8 producing 276 horsepower and 314 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L V8 producing 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sequoia for its comfortable ride and ample cargo space, but some common complaints include its large size, fuel economy, and age-related maintenance issues.

**Summary**

The 2008 Toyota Sequoia is a capable and spacious SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine issues like cam tower leaks (5.7L V8) and exhaust manifold cracks (4.7L V8) can be costly. Transmission problems like torque converter failure can also arise. Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension system (if equipped), are another area to inspect. Rust on the frame is a concern, especially in regions with road salt use. The severity of these issues varies, but potential repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major repairs like engine or suspension overhauls.
