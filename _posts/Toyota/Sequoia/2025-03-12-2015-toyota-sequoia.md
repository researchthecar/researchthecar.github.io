The 2015 Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, reliability, and off-road capability. It was offered with a single engine option: a 5.7L V8 producing 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its large cargo capacity, comfortable ride, and Toyota's reputation for durability. Common dislikes often revolve around its fuel economy, large size making it difficult to park, and somewhat dated interior compared to newer competitors.

**Summary**

The 2015 Toyota Sequoia is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as secondary air injection pump failure, torque converter problems, and potential rust issues. The cost of repairs can vary widely, with some issues being relatively inexpensive to fix while others, such as transmission or air suspension repairs, can be quite costly. Proper maintenance and regular inspections are essential to prevent or mitigate these issues. The severity is medium, as the vehicle is overall reliable, but some failures can cause the car to be inoperable. The issues can range from low cost to expensive.
