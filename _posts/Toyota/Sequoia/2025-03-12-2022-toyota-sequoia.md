The 2022 Toyota Sequoia marked a significant redesign for the full-size SUV, moving to a new platform and a standard hybrid powertrain. This generation features a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing 437 horsepower and 583 lb-ft of torque. All models use a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sequoia's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong towing capability. However, some common criticisms include the high price point, large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and some reported issues related to the new powertrain and technology.

**Engine**

**3.5L Twin-Turbo V6 Hybrid**

*   **Wastegate Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wastegate actuator, responsible for controlling boost pressure, can fail. This results in a loss of power, potential engine knocking, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty wastegate actuator and potentially performing software updates to the engine control unit (ECU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injectors may leak or fail, causing rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injectors and ensuring proper fuel system pressure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hybrid Battery Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hybrid battery system may experience malfunctions, leading to reduced electric driving range, error messages on the dashboard, and potential vehicle immobilization.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the hybrid battery system and replacing faulty components, such as individual battery modules or the entire battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting, especially during low-speed maneuvers or when downshifting. A clunking noise may also be present.
    *   Solution: Performing transmission software updates, checking transmission fluid levels, or potentially replacing valve body components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping may occur, particularly during acceleration or when shifting gears, leading to a loss of power and erratic driving behavior.
    *   Solution: Inspecting the transmission for internal damage and potentially replacing damaged components, such as clutch packs or the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with air suspension may experience issues such as sagging, uneven ride height, or failure of the air compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty air struts, air compressor, or ride height sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive, requiring a reboot.
    *   Solution: Performing software updates to the infotainment system or replacing the head unit if the issue persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $2,000+ (depending on warranty coverage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sensors such as blind spot monitoring, parking sensors, or lane departure warning systems may malfunction, leading to false alerts or failure to detect objects.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and replacing faulty sensors, checking wiring connections, or recalibrating the sensor system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power rear liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or it may become stuck in a particular position.
    *   Solution: Inspecting the liftgate motor, sensors, and wiring harness, and replacing faulty components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**

**Summary**

The 2022 Toyota Sequoia, while offering a significant upgrade in terms of power and features, has experienced some growing pains related to its new powertrain and technology. The most concerning issues involve the engine (wastegate, injectors, hybrid battery) and transmission (harsh shifting, slipping), which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions are also common complaints. While many issues may be covered under warranty, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly.
