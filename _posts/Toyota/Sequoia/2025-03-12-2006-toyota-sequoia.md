The 2006 Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV known for its reliability, spaciousness, and towing capability. Engine options included a 4.7L 2UZ-FE V8 engine producing 273 horsepower and 314 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. While appreciated for its dependability and comfortable ride, some owners have reported issues related to age and wear. Common dislikes include fuel economy and the vehicle's large size making it harder to maneuver.

**Engine**

**4.7L 2UZ-FE V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking/Leaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or hissing sound, especially upon cold starts, which may diminish as the engine warms up. This is due to cracks in the exhaust manifolds, most commonly near the welds. A smell of exhaust in the cabin could also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifold(s). Some owners opt for aftermarket headers for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ per manifold (depending on whether OEM or aftermarket parts are used and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking onto the engine block, often noticed as a burning oil smell or visible oil residue around the valve covers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leak from Timing Cover**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the front of the engine where the timing cover meets the engine block. This can be difficult to diagnose, and is often misdiagnosed as a valve cover gasket leak.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing cover gasket/seal. This is a labor intensive job that requires removing the timing belt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A750E 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, failure to shift into certain gears, or the transmission getting stuck in a gear. The check engine light may illuminate with transmission-related error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty shift solenoid(s). It is often recommended to replace all solenoids at once.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the number of solenoids replaced and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at certain speeds, especially when the torque converter is attempting to lock up. Can also cause stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. It is usually recommended to rebuild or replace the entire transmission at this point.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+ (including labor and the cost of a new/rebuilt transmission)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle sitting unevenly, failing to raise or lower, or the air compressor running constantly. This is specific to models equipped with the optional air suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air struts, air compressor, or air lines, depending on the source of the leak or failure. Converting to a traditional coil spring suspension is a common alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per air strut (for replacement with OEM or aftermarket air struts). $1000-$3000+ for coil spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Height Control Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle sitting unevenly, failing to raise or lower, or the air compressor running constantly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear height control sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and alignment issues can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lower control arm bushings or the entire lower control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 per side (depending on whether just the bushings are replaced or the entire control arm).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, operating slowly, or only working intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Hatch Wiring Harness Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear window not working, license plate lights not working, rear wiper not working.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the rear hatch wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the frame, suspension components, and other undercarriage parts, especially in regions with road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, rust converter application, or undercoating. In severe cases, frame replacement may be necessary, but is often cost-prohibitive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$2000+ (depending on the severity of the rust and the extent of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Liftgate Strut Failure**

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Lid Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The latch on the center console lid breaks, making it difficult to keep the console closed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the center console lid or the latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (depending on whether a new lid or just the latch is replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, often due to sun exposure and age.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the method used).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2006 Toyota Sequoia, while generally reliable, can experience age-related issues. Exhaust manifold leaks, valve cover gasket leaks, and rust are common concerns. Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension (if equipped), can also arise. Electrically, power window motor failures can occur, as well as issues with the rear hatch wiring. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, especially transmission or suspension work. It's important to have a pre-purchase inspection performed to identify any existing or potential problems.
