The 2007 Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and towing capacity. It offered two engine options: a 4.7L 2UZ-FE V8 producing 276 hp and 313 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L 3UR-FE V8 producing 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed or 6-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine choice. Owners often praise its comfortable ride and longevity, but some common complaints include fuel economy, size making it difficult to park, and age-related issues as the vehicle gets older.

**Engine**

**4.7L 2UZ-FE V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common on higher mileage 2UZ-FE engines. These leaks often originate from the valve cover gaskets, the front crankshaft seal, or the rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. Thoroughly clean the affected area after the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifolds are prone to cracking, especially in colder climates. Symptoms include a ticking noise upon startup that diminishes as the engine warms up, and a decrease in fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked exhaust manifold. It's often recommended to replace both manifolds to ensure even exhaust flow.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per manifold, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L 3UR-FE V8**

*   **Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air injection pump helps reduce emissions during cold starts. These pumps can fail, especially in regions with high humidity or road salt usage. Symptoms include a check engine light with codes P0418, P2440, P2441, P2442, P2443, P2444, P2445, P2446, P2447, P2448, P2449.
    *   Solution: Replace the air injection pump assembly or bypass the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ for replacement; $200 - $500 for a bypass system install.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: High-mileage 3UR-FE engines can experience timing chain tensioner failure. This results in a rattling noise from the front of the engine, especially at startup. If left unattended, it can cause significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (A750F)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Symptoms include shuddering during light acceleration, especially at highway speeds, and possible error codes relating to torque converter lockup.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Consider flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter during the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (AB60E/F)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh shifting between gears, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can be caused by worn valve body components or contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush using the correct Toyota WS fluid. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for a fluid flush; $800 - $2000+ for valve body work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sequoias equipped with the rear air suspension system can experience air leaks in the airbags, compressor failure, or sensor malfunctions. Symptoms include a sagging rear end, the compressor running constantly, and a "suspension height low" warning light.
    *   Solution: Replace the airbags, compressor, or sensors as needed. A common aftermarket solution is to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ for individual air suspension components; $800 - $2000+ for a coil spring conversion kit installation.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front lower control arm bushings are prone to wear and tear, especially in areas with rough roads. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the lower control arm bushings. It is often easier to replace the entire lower control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power window motors can fail, causing the window to stop working or operate intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, leading to a dead battery and/or electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion on the frame, especially in areas where road salt is used, is a common issue.
    *   Solution: Apply rust inhibitor/remover, and apply an undercoating.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$400+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported that the dashboard cracks. This is more common in hotter climates.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or install a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2007 Toyota Sequoia is overall a reliable vehicle, but like any older car, it has its share of common issues. Engine problems, particularly oil leaks and air injection pump failures on the 5.7L, can be moderately expensive to repair. Transmission issues, although less frequent, can also be costly. Suspension and electrical problems are also common, and the severity ranges depending on the component needing repair. Addressing these issues promptly will help keep the Sequoia running smoothly for years to come.
