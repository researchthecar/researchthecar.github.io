The 2024 Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, reliability, and off-road capabilities. It is powered by a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 engine paired with a hybrid system, producing 437 horsepower and 583 lb-ft of torque. While generally well-regarded, some owners have reported certain issues. Common praises include its comfortable ride, strong engine performance, and Toyota's reputation for dependability.
