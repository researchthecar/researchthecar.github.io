The 2011 Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and Toyota's reputation for reliability. Engine options include a 4.6L V8 producing 310 horsepower and 327 lb-ft of torque and a 5.7L V8 producing 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sequoia for its comfortable ride and ample cargo space, but some dislike its large size and fuel economy.

**Summary**

The 2011 Toyota Sequoia generally holds up well but has a few areas of concern. The 5.7L V8 engine can experience oil leaks and sensor failures. The 6-speed automatic transmission may develop a torque converter shudder. The air suspension, if equipped, is a potential failure point. Electrical issues like power window motor failure are also possible. The undercarriage is susceptible to rust, especially in areas with road salt. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (sensor replacements, window motors) to more significant (transmission or air suspension repairs). Costs to repair can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the issue.
