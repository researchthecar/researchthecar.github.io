The 2019 Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV known for its robust build, ample interior space, and strong towing capability. It only came with one engine option, the 5.7L V8, and one transmission option, the 6-speed automatic. The 5.7L V8 produces 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Sequoia for its reliability, spaciousness, and off-road capabilities. Criticisms typically include its outdated technology, lower fuel economy compared to competitors, and bulky size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.
