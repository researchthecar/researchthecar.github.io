**Summary**

The 2014 Toyota Sequoia is generally a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of certain common issues. Engine issues like oil leaks and exhaust manifold cracking, along with transmission problems such as torque converter shudder, can be relatively expensive to fix. Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension, can also add to the cost of ownership. Electrical and interior issues tend to be less severe but should still be inspected. While the Sequoia is known for its longevity, addressing these potential problems can help ensure a better ownership experience. Frame rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with road salt.
