The 2023 Toyota Sequoia represents a significant redesign for the model, moving to a fully boxed frame and a new powertrain. This generation Sequoia ditched the old V8 in favor of a turbocharged 3.4-liter V6 engine, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The standard engine produces 437 horsepower and 583 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Sequoia's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong towing capability. However, common complaints include the complicated infotainment system, some interior material quality issues, and concerns about fuel economy given the turbocharged engine.

**Engine**

**3.4L Twin-Turbo V6 (i-FORCE MAX)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure, resulting in a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling) from the engine bay, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of coolant leaks originating from the turbocharger coolant lines. The coolant leaks may be visible on the ground or detected by a low coolant level warning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger coolant lines and/or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (Direct Shift AWR10L65)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have described experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly when shifting at lower speeds. Others have noted a hesitation or delay when accelerating from a stop. Some sources point to programming issues with the transmission control module (TCM).
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update/reflash of the TCM may resolve the issue. More severe cases may require transmission repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (for software update) - $6,000+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Fluid Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported transmission fluid leaks, often originating from the transmission pan gasket or seals. This can lead to slipping or failure of the transmission if left unchecked.
    * Solution: Replace the transmission pan gasket, seals, or possibly the entire transmission if the fluid loss has caused internal damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (for gasket/seals) $6,000+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some Sequoias are equipped with an air suspension system. Issues can include the compressor failing, air leaks, and the vehicle not maintaining proper ride height. Error messages related to the suspension system may appear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the failing component (compressor, air spring, lines, etc.) and replacement of the faulty part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches/Freezing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, particularly the large touchscreen, can experience glitches, freezing, and slow response times. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity issues have also been reported.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Toyota may address some of these issues. In more severe cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1,000+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Toyota Sequoia, while generally reliable, has experienced a few common issues, particularly related to the new turbocharged engine, 10-speed transmission, and infotainment system. The turbocharger issues and transmission problems could be considered more severe and potentially costly to repair. Electrical glitches in the infotainment system can be frustrating for owners. While these issues exist, they do not affect every single vehicle and Toyota has been known to address common concerns via technical service bulletins (TSBs) and software updates. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect any used 2023 Sequoia before purchase.
