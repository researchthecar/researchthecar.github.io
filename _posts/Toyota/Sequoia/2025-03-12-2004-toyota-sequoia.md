**Summary**

The 2004 Toyota Sequoia generally exhibits issues related to its age. Engine issues such as valve cover gasket leaks and exhaust manifold cracks are relatively common and can be moderately expensive to repair. Transmission issues, especially slipping, can be more costly, especially if a full rebuild or replacement is needed. Suspension issues, particularly concerning the lower ball joints and (if equipped) the rear air suspension, can also lead to significant repair expenses. Rust is a concern, especially in regions with harsh winters, and can necessitate costly frame repairs or replacement. The overall severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potential safety concerns if critical components like suspension or brakes are affected. Repair costs can vary considerably, but addressing these common problems proactively can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
