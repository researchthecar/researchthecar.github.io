**Summary**

The 2018 Toyota Sequoia, while generally reliable, does have some common issues owners should be aware of. Engine-related oil leaks and potential starter failures are a moderate concern and can range in cost to repair. Suspension issues like air suspension problems (if equipped) and ball joint wear can affect ride quality and safety, also incurring a moderate repair cost. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and alternator can be annoying. Rust on the undercarriage is a major concern in certain environments, and can be costly to fix if not addressed early. The cracked dashboard is a cosmetic issue but can detract from the vehicle's appearance and value, with a moderate to high cost to repair. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas, especially in areas with heavy use of road salt or harsh climates.
