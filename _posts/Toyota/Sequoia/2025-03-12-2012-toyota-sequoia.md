The 2012 Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, reliability, and towing capacity. Engine options included a 4.6L V8 producing 310 horsepower and 327 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L V8 generating 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sequoia's comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, the vehicle's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and some reported issues with specific components as outlined below.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**5.7L V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or hissing sound, especially upon cold start, which may diminish as the engine warms up. This indicates an exhaust leak, commonly from a crack in the exhaust manifold. Can lead to reduced fuel economy and potential exhaust fumes entering the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifold with a new manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, codes related to air injection system malfunction (e.g., P0418, P2440, P2442). Loud buzzing or whirring noise from the air injection pump during start-up, or no noise at all. Can result in the vehicle going into limp mode in some cases.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed air injection pump and/or valve. It is recommended to replace both at the same time to ensure a complete fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibration felt during light acceleration or when maintaining a steady speed, typically between 30-50 mph. This is often caused by wear or contamination of the transmission fluid, or internal wear in the torque converter.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may temporarily alleviate the issue, but replacement of the torque converter is often the long-term solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (fluid flush) - $2,000+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, particularly when parked overnight. The air suspension compressor may run constantly or not at all. Check engine light or suspension warning light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed air suspension compressor and inspection of the air springs for leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Delaminating Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard develops cracks and becomes sticky or gummy to the touch, particularly in hot climates. This is a known issue with some Toyota vehicles of this era.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Toyota Sequoia, while generally reliable, does have some common issues owners may encounter. The most notable potential problems are related to exhaust manifold cracks and air injection pump failures on the 5.7L V8, torque converter shudder in the 6-speed automatic transmission, and potential dashboard delamination. While the cost of repairs can vary, some issues, such as torque converter replacement and dashboard replacement, can be relatively expensive. The rear air suspension, if equipped, is also a potential point of failure. Overall, buyers should be aware of these potential issues and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchase.
