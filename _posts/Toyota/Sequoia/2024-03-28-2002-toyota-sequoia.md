**Introduction:**

The 2002 Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and reliability. It is available with two engine and transmission options: a 4.7L V8 with a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 3.4L V6 with a 5-speed automatic transmission. While the Sequoia is generally a reliable vehicle, it has had some reported issues over the years.

**Engine**

**4.7L V8**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption:** The 4.7L V8 engine has been known to consume excessive oil, leading to engine damage. Symptoms include decreased oil levels, blue smoke from the exhaust, and reduced engine performance. The issue can be caused by worn piston rings or valve seals. Replacement of the affected parts is necessary.
* **Cam Shaft Position Sensors:** Faulty camshaft position sensors can cause engine stalling, rough idling, and decreased performance. Replacing the affected sensor is typically the solution.
* **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves:** Carbon buildup on the intake valves can lead to reduced engine power and fuel efficiency. Cleaning or replacing the affected valves is necessary.

**3.4L V6**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Harsh Shifting:** The 4-speed automatic transmission has been known to exhibit harsh shifting, especially during upshifts. The issue can be caused by worn clutches or other internal components. Repair or replacement of the affected parts is typically necessary.
* **Slipping Transmission:** The transmission may slip when shifting gears, causing loss of power and acceleration. The issue can be caused by worn clutches or a lack of transmission fluid. Replacement of the affected parts or fluid replenishment is necessary.

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Rear Axle Bearing Failure:** The rear axle bearings have been known to fail prematurely, leading to a growling or humming noise from the rear of the vehicle. Replacement of the affected bearings is required.
* **Front Control Arm Bushings:** Worn front control arm bushings can lead to a clunking or rattling noise during suspension movement. Replacement of the affected bushings is the solution.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator has been known to fail prematurely, causing electrical system problems. Symptoms include dim headlights, flickering dashboard lights, and difficulty starting the vehicle. Replacement of the alternator is necessary.
* **Battery Drain:** The electrical system may experience excessive battery drain, even when the vehicle is not in use. The issue can be caused by a faulty component or a short circuit. Diagnosing and repairing the affected component or electrical line is required.

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate Handle Failure:** The tailgate handle can fail, making it difficult or impossible to open the tailgate. Replacement of the affected handle is the solution.

**Interior**

* **Headliner Sagging:** The headliner may sag or detach from the roof due to adhesive failure. Reattachment or replacement of the affected headliner is necessary.
* **Door Lock Actuator Failure:** The door lock actuators can fail, resulting in difficulty locking or unlocking the vehicle. Replacement of the affected actuators is the solution.

**Summary:**

The 2002 Toyota Sequoia is generally a reliable vehicle, but it has had some reported issues. The most severe issues affect the engine, including excessive oil consumption and camshaft position sensor failure. The transmission has also experienced some problems, such as harsh shifting and slipping. Other issues include suspension component failure, electrical system problems, and minor interior defects. The cost of repairs can range from minor to significant, depending on the severity of the issue.
