The 2010 Toyota Yaris is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and reliability. It comes with a 1.5-liter inline-4 engine, producing 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Yaris's affordability, ease of parking, and excellent gas mileage. Common dislikes include the basic interior, limited cargo space, and somewhat sluggish acceleration.

**Engine**

**1.5L 1NZ-FE Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 1.5L engine begins to consume more oil than usual. This can manifest as needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels frequently and topping off as needed. If consumption is severe, a compression test and leak-down test can help determine the cause. Potential fixes range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between first and second gear. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change with Toyota WS fluid may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a more in-depth diagnostic may be necessary, possibly pointing to valve body issues or a failing solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,500+ (depending on severity, ranges from fluid change to complete rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. Can also result in clunking noises from the rear of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (for parts and labor, depending on brand and shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power window motor fails, causing the window to stop working or move erratically.
    * Solution: The power window motor needs to be replaced
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard is prone to cracking, especially in hot climates, due to sun exposure and age.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard. Alternatively, using a dashboard cover to protect the surface.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1000 (replacement) $20-$50 (dashboard cover)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Toyota Yaris is generally a reliable vehicle, but common issues include excessive oil consumption in the 1.5L engine and harsh shifting in the 4-speed automatic transmission. Suspension issues, specifically rear shock failure, and electrical problems with power windows are also reported. Dashboard cracking is another common complaint. The severity and cost of these issues vary. Oil consumption can lead to engine damage if left unchecked, while transmission problems can affect drivability. Suspension and electrical issues are generally less severe but can impact ride comfort and convenience. Repair costs range from relatively inexpensive fixes like fluid changes and shock absorber replacement to more costly engine or transmission repairs.
