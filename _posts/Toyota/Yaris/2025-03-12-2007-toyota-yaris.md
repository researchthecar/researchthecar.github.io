The 2007 Toyota Yaris is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and reliability, making it a popular choice for budget-conscious buyers. It came with a 1.5L 4-cylinder engine producing 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. The engine was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its affordability, gas mileage, and ease of parking. Some common dislikes include the basic interior, limited cargo space, and somewhat sluggish acceleration.

**Engine**

**1.5L 4-Cylinder (1NZ-FE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs. This can manifest as the need to add a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less, along with blueish smoke from the exhaust, especially upon startup.
    *   Solution: Addressing excessive oil consumption can range from replacing the PCV valve to more involved repairs like piston ring replacement or engine rebuild, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (PCV valve), $1,500 - $4,000+ (piston rings/engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump can fail, leading to coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include visible coolant leaks near the water pump pulley, a whining noise from the engine compartment, and the engine temperature gauge rising above normal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump. It's often recommended to replace the thermostat and coolant at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or harsh shifting, especially between gears. This can manifest as noticeable jerks or clunks during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Initially, check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change might improve shifting. However, if the problem persists, it could indicate internal wear or damage requiring more extensive repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid change), $1,500 - $3,500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks can wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased braking distances. Symptoms include excessive bouncing after hitting bumps, nose-diving during braking, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and/or shocks. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensor failures can cause the check engine light to illuminate, poor fuel economy, and rough idling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor. It's recommended to use an OEM or high-quality aftermarket sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Headlight Bulb Burnout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Yaris is known for headlight bulbs frequently burning out.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headlight bulb.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can be an issue, especially in areas with harsh winters and road salt usage. Common rust spots include the wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Addressing rust involves removing the rust, treating the affected area, and applying a protective coating or paint. The extent of the repair depends on the severity of the rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on severity and location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracking of the dashboard, especially in areas with high sun exposure.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+ (dashboard cover), $500 - $1,500+ (dashboard replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Toyota Yaris is a reliable car overall, but some common issues can arise as it ages. Engine issues such as excessive oil consumption and water pump failure can be costly. Transmission problems like rough shifting may also require significant repairs. Suspension wear and electrical faults are generally less expensive to address. Rust is also a concern. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the car inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
