The 2012 Toyota Yaris is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and reliability. It comes with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Yaris for its affordability, easy maneuverability, and good gas mileage. However, some criticisms include its basic interior, limited cargo space, and somewhat unrefined engine noise.

**Engine**

**1.5L 1NZ-FE Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 1.5L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be indicated by low oil level warnings and/or blueish smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can resolve the issue. However, this is a major repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Rough Idle or Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough idle, especially at startup, or even occasional stalling. This is normally noticed when the vehicle is first turned on.
    * Solution: Cleaning the mass airflow sensor (MAF) and throttle body may resolve the issue. Checking and replacing spark plugs may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between first and second gear.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change may alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, a more extensive inspection of the transmission may be required to identify any worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping is a possible symptom in the 4-speed automatic transmission. The driver may hear the engine revving faster than normal or hear a grinding noise with no or little acceleration.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid to see if the fluid level is normal or low. Check the fluid for a burnt odor. Replace the fluid and filter. If the issue persists, the transmission may require a full replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride quality, excessive bouncing, and/or unusual noises (clunking) when driving over bumps. Uneven tire wear can also be an indicator.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (for replacing all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, leading to difficulty starting the car or a dead battery. This may be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Oxygen Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, decreased fuel economy, and/or rough engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, particularly in areas prone to moisture and salt exposure (e.g., wheel wells, rocker panels).
    *   Solution: Treat the rust with rust removal products and apply protective coatings. In severe cases, panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard material, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or install a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Toyota Yaris generally exhibits reliable performance, but some common issues reported by owners include excessive oil consumption in the engine, harsh shifting with the automatic transmission, and suspension wear. Electrical issues such as battery drain can also occur. Interior issues like dashboard cracking are possible, and rust can form on the exterior. While the costs of some repairs can be significant (e.g., engine work), many issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to address. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect any used Yaris before purchase.
