The 2018 Toyota Yaris is a subcompact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and ease of parking. It is powered by a 1.5-liter inline-4 engine producing 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission. People like the Yaris for its low running costs and dependability. Common dislikes include the unrefined engine noise, limited rear seat space, and basic interior features.

**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, noticing lower oil levels on the dipstick, and potentially a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and topping off as needed. In more severe cases, a dealer inspection might be needed to assess potential causes like piston ring wear or valve seal issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed, from topping off oil to complete engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idle/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a rough idle or hesitation upon acceleration, especially when the engine is cold. This could be due to a variety of factors, including dirty fuel injectors or a faulty mass airflow sensor.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the fuel injectors, replacing the mass airflow sensor, or performing a throttle body cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the component needing cleaning or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds. This could be due to worn transmission fluid or a faulty shift solenoid.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush or replacing the faulty shift solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*No Issues Found*

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle. This could be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component or a faulty alternator.
    *   Solution: Performing a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain, replacing the battery, or replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In hotter climates, some owners have reported cracking in the dashboard material, particularly around the air vents and instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover to protect it from further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Toyota Yaris is generally a reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues such as excessive oil consumption, harsh shifting of the automatic transmission, and premature battery drain. Dashboard cracking can also occur. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can help prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's longevity. While some issues are minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more costly, particularly if they involve engine or transmission repairs.
