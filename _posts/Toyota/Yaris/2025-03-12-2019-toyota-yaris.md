**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil pressure light illuminating or visually checking the dipstick and finding very low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and topping off as needed. In severe cases, engine component inspection and possible replacement of piston rings or other related parts may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (for oil top off) - $1500+ (for major engine work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. Perform a transmission fluid flush. If the issue persists, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $2500+ (for rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced premature wear of the struts and shocks, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, particularly over bumps or uneven road surfaces.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent freezing or crashing of the infotainment system, requiring a restart to regain functionality. This can affect navigation, audio, and other connected features.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or software update. If the issue persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (head unit replacement)

    *   Description/Symptoms: Development of rattling noises from the dashboard or trim panels, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing the loose panels or components. This may involve adding padding or replacing clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Toyota Yaris generally demonstrates good reliability, but like any vehicle, it has its share of issues. The most commonly reported problems involve the engine (excessive oil consumption) and transmission (harsh shifting), followed by suspension wear and infotainment system glitches. The severity and cost of these issues vary, ranging from relatively inexpensive fixes like oil top-offs or software updates to more costly repairs such as engine work or transmission replacement. Overall, the 2019 Yaris is a dependable car, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing.
