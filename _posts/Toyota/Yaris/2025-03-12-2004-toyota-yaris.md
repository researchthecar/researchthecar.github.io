The 2004 Toyota Yaris, also known as the Echo in some markets, is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. The 2004 Yaris typically came with a 1.5-liter inline-4 engine (1NZ-FE) producing around 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate its reliability and ease of parking, while some dislike its basic interior and limited cargo space.
