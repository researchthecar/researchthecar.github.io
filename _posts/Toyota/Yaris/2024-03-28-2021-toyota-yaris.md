**Introduction**

The 2021 Toyota Yaris is a subcompact hatchback available with a single engine and two transmission options: a 1.5L inline-four engine paired with either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). With 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque, the Yaris offers decent fuel economy and maneuverability but lacks power and excitement. Drivers appreciate the Yaris's reliability, safety features, and affordable price point, while some criticize its cramped interior and lack of modern amenities.
