**Introduction**

The 2010 Toyota Yaris is a subcompact hatchback offered with two engine and transmission options: a 1.5L inline-four with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission, and a 1.8L inline-four with a 6-speed manual transmission. The 1.5L engine produces 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.8L engine produces 132 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. The Yaris is known for its fuel efficiency, versatility, and nimble handling, but it has also faced criticism for its lack of power and acceleration.
