The 2020 Toyota Yaris is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and ease of driving, offered as a hatchback. It is equipped with a 1.5-liter inline-4 engine producing 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. The Yaris is available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Yaris's affordability and fuel economy, but some dislike its limited cargo space and somewhat unrefined driving experience compared to other subcompacts.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. The specific cause is often difficult to diagnose without extensive testing, but may be related to piston ring issues.
    *   Solution: Initially, monitor oil levels regularly and top off as needed. If consumption is excessive, a compression test and leak-down test can help determine the source. Depending on the cause, potential fixes include piston ring replacement or valve seal repair.
