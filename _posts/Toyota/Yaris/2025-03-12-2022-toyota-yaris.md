The 2022 Toyota Yaris is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and nimble handling. However, in the North American Market, the Yaris was discontinued after the 2020 model year. The 2022 model year Yaris is available in other markets, primarily Europe, Australia, and parts of Asia. These markets largely feature hybrid powertrains with a 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine. This engine produces around 114 horsepower. The Yaris is praised for its affordability and ease of parking, but some find its smaller size and limited cargo space to be drawbacks. Given the different regional markets, it is important to understand the Yaris's configuration and common issues specific to those versions. The information below reflects issues that have been reported for the current generation Yaris models sold outside of North America.

**Engine**

**1.5L Three-Cylinder Hybrid**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports exist of the engine hesitating or stalling, particularly when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This issue is often described as intermittent and can occur regardless of driving conditions.
    *   Solution: The cause could be due to a software issue related to the hybrid control system. Reprogramming the ECU (Engine Control Unit) is the most frequent repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature degradation of the hybrid battery, leading to reduced fuel economy and decreased electric driving range. This often manifests as more frequent engine engagement, even at low speeds and with a full charge indicated.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack is the only permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on battery specifications and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**e-CVT (Electronic Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Unusual Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining, humming, or grinding noises emanating from the transmission, especially during acceleration or deceleration. The sounds may be subtle at first, gradually increasing in intensity.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, a fluid change or a complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change ($100-$200), Transmission replacement ($3,000-$5,000+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, responsible for navigation, audio, and vehicle settings, may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can occur randomly or during specific operations, such as using navigation or connecting a smartphone.
    *   Solution: A software update to the infotainment system is usually the first step. In some cases, a replacement of the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (often free or included with service), Head unit replacement ($500 - $1500+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Sensors**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sensors such as the parking sensors, blind spot monitoring sensors, or collision avoidance sensors can malfunction, leading to false alerts or a complete failure of the system.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor. Recalibration of the system might also be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the sensor and recalibration needs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area. These noises are often amplified on rough roads or at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: Identifying and securing the source of the noise. This may involve adding padding, tightening screws, or replacing loose trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+, depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Spots**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust spots appearing on body panels or undercarriage. This is more common in regions with harsh weather or heavy road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair which may involve sanding, treating, and repainting the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per spot, depending on size and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Toyota Yaris, primarily sold outside of North America, presents several potential issues, ranging from engine hesitation and hybrid battery degradation to electrical glitches and interior rattles. Engine and transmission issues, while not widespread, can be costly to repair, particularly hybrid battery replacements. Electrical problems with the infotainment system can be frustrating. While rust spots are more dependent on environmental factors, their presence can detract from the vehicle's appearance and long-term durability. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used Yaris before purchase.
