The 2016 Toyota Yaris is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and affordability. It was available as a three-door or five-door hatchback. The sole engine option for the 2016 Yaris is a 1.5-liter inline-four cylinder engine producing 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Yaris for its ease of parking, low running costs, and Toyota's reputation for reliability. However, some criticize its basic interior, limited rear passenger space, and lack of advanced technology features.

The most significant concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption, which can lead to costly repairs. Other issues like harsh shifting, rear shock absorber leaks, and electrical glitches are less severe but should be addressed to maintain optimal vehicle performance. While most of these problems can be resolved with relatively affordable repairs, a complete engine rebuild or replacement due to oil consumption can be a major expense.
