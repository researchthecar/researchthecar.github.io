The 2024 Toyota Crown marks the return of the Crown nameplate to the US market, offering a blend of sedan and crossover styling. It comes in three trim levels: XLE, Limited, and Platinum. The XLE and Limited trims feature a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with Toyota's Hybrid MAX system, producing a combined 236 horsepower. The Platinum trim boasts a more powerful Hybrid MAX system with a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, delivering a combined 340 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. The XLE and Limited trims use an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT), while the Platinum trim is equipped with a direct shift six-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Crown's comfortable ride, distinctive styling, and fuel efficiency (especially in the XLE and Limited trims). Common criticisms include the infotainment system's complexity, the unconventional exterior design, and the rear seat headroom that can be limited for taller passengers.
