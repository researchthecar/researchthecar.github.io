**2023 Toyota Crown**

The 2023 Toyota Crown is Toyota's first-ever sedan to offer a hybrid powertrain, a plug-in hybrid powertrain, and a high-performance hybrid powertrain. The hybrid powertrain pairs a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor to produce a combined 236 horsepower, while the plug-in hybrid powertrain pairs the same engine with a larger electric motor and a larger battery pack to produce a combined 302 horsepower. The high-performance hybrid powertrain pairs a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor to produce a combined 340 horsepower.

The Crown is available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, and it comes standard with a number of features, including a 12.3-inch touchscreen, heated seats, and a sunroof. The Crown is also available with a number of optional features, including a head-up display, a surround-view camera system, and a premium audio system.
