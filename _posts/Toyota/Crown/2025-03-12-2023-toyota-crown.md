The 2023 Toyota Crown is a full-size sedan offering a blend of comfort, fuel efficiency, and modern technology. The base model features a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with Toyota's Hybrid Max system, producing a combined 236 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque, connected to an Electronically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). An upgraded powertrain option is the Hybrid Max 2.4-liter turbocharged engine, producing 340 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, paired with a direct shift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Crown's comfortable ride, fuel economy, and distinctive styling. Some criticisms include the somewhat unconventional exterior design and the infotainment system's complexity.
