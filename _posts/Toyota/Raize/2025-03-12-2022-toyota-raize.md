The 2022 Toyota Raize is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency, maneuverability, and affordability. It typically comes with a 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged engine producing around 98 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque, paired with a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Some markets may offer different engine options. Owners generally appreciate its compact size for city driving and parking, as well as its fuel economy. Common dislikes include the relatively small engine and limited rear passenger space.

**Engine**

**1.0L Turbocharged Three-Cylinder**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Lack of Power**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a noticeable hesitation or lack of power, especially when accelerating from a stop or when climbing hills. This is exacerbated by the small engine size and can be more pronounced when the vehicle is fully loaded.
    *   Solution: Dealers may suggest a software update to the ECU (Engine Control Unit) to improve throttle response. In more severe cases, checking the turbocharger boost pressure and potentially replacing faulty sensors related to air intake or fuel delivery might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported occasional engine misfires, particularly during cold starts. This can result in rough idling and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis often involves checking the spark plugs, ignition coils, and fuel injectors. Replacing faulty spark plugs or ignition coils is a common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced jerky acceleration or hesitation, especially at low speeds. This is a common characteristic of some CVT transmissions, but can be more pronounced in the Raize.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change might help in some cases. A software update for the transmission control unit (TCU) may also improve shift smoothness. In rare cases, internal CVT damage could require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ for fluid change and software update; $3,000 - $6,000+ for rebuild/replacement

*   **Excessive CVT Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that they can hear the CVT working a lot in the vehicle and complain about the noise.
    *   Solution: In some cases, it may be normal characteristics of the vehicle and it would require sound dampening on the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Dealers may need to inspect the rear shocks, struts, and sway bar links. Tightening loose components or replacing worn bushings can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported the infotainment system occasionally freezing or lagging, particularly when using navigation or Bluetooth.
    *   Solution: A software update to the infotainment system may resolve the issue. In some cases, replacing the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $800+

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may intermittently fail to display an image, or the image may be distorted or blurry.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring for damage. If the wiring is intact, the camera unit itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rattling noises coming from the dashboard or door panels, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Dealerships may attempt to locate and secure the source of the rattle by adding padding or tightening loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+

**Exterior**

*   **Loose/Misaligned Exterior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed loose or misaligned exterior trim pieces, such as the side moldings or bumper trim.
    *   Solution: The trim pieces may need to be re-secured or replaced if damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+

**Recalls**

*   None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Toyota Raize, while generally reliable, does have some common issues reported by owners. Engine hesitation and CVT-related problems appear to be the most frequent concerns, potentially affecting drivability. Electrical glitches and interior/exterior trim issues are also present.
