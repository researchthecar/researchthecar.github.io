The 2024 Toyota RAV4 Prime is a plug-in hybrid SUV that combines practicality with impressive fuel efficiency and performance. It's powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with electric motors, producing a combined 302 horsepower and an estimated 199 lb-ft of torque. It uses an electronically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). Owners often praise its quick acceleration, all-electric driving range (estimated at 42 miles), and spacious interior. Common criticisms include the infotainment system's dated interface and the higher price point compared to the standard RAV4 Hybrid. Other engines available in the non-Prime RAV4 include a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine.
