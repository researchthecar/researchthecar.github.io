### Summary Verdict
The 2024 Toyota Mirai, while utilizing advanced hydrogen fuel cell technology, benefits from Toyota's extensive engineering and manufacturing expertise. Early data suggests strong reliability, particularly in its electric drivetrain and chassis components. The primary areas of concern, as with most fuel cell vehicles, revolve around the longevity and potential cost of the fuel cell stack and the integrity of the hydrogen system. However, Toyota's warranty coverage for these critical components is typically robust. Other systems, including electrical, exterior, and interior, appear to be performing reliably, mirroring the dependability expected from a Toyota product. Owners should be aware of the specialized nature of the fuel cell system and its maintenance requirements, though widespread issues are not currently reported.
