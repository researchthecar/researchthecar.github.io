The 2019 Toyota Mirai is a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, offering an alternative to traditional gasoline engines and battery electric vehicles. It boasts an EPA-estimated range of 312 miles and produces zero emissions, with water as its only byproduct. The Miraiâ€™s fuel cell system generates electricity to power a 113 kW (151 hp) electric motor, producing 247 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Mirai for its quiet and smooth ride, along with its environmental friendliness and unique technology. However, some criticisms include the limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure, higher fuel costs compared to gasoline in some areas, and the vehicle's somewhat polarizing styling.

**Electric Motor**

**Fuel Cell Electric Motor**
* **Inverter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may display warning lights, experience a loss of power, or fail to start. The inverter is responsible for converting DC power from the fuel cell stack into AC power for the electric motor.
    * Solution: Replacement of the inverter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $7,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Cell Stack Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced range, decreased performance, and potential warning lights. This degradation occurs over time and usage.
    * Solution: Fuel cell stack replacement (covered under warranty for a significant period).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: (Out of Warranty) $20,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**High-Voltage Battery**

* **Reduced Battery Capacity**
    * Description/Symptoms: While not as common as in battery EVs, some owners have reported a gradual decline in the high-voltage battery's capacity to store energy, leading to reduced power output.
    * Solution: High-voltage battery replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $10,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Hydrogen Fuel Cell System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: A variety of warning lights related to the fuel cell system, potentially accompanied by reduced performance or the inability to refuel. These could be related to sensors, pumps, or other components within the system.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair/replacement of the affected component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the specific issue, from $500 to several thousand dollars.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Faulty sensors (e.g., hydrogen leak detection sensors) may trigger warning lights or prevent the vehicle from operating correctly.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Hydrogen Tank Concerns**
    * Description/Symptoms: Although rare, concerns about the integrity and safety of the hydrogen tanks are sometimes expressed.
    * Solution: Inspection and potential replacement of the tanks if any issues are found (usually covered by warranty if a defect is identified).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Very high if out of warranty.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system might experience occasional freezes, slow response times, or connectivity issues.
    * Solution: Software updates or, in some cases, replacement of the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Toyota Mirai, while innovative, can present some unique issues related to its hydrogen fuel cell technology. The most concerning potential problems involve the fuel cell stack and inverter, due to the high cost of replacement if not covered by warranty. Electrical glitches and sensor issues can also occur. While hydrogen tank concerns exist, they are rare. The severity of issues can range from minor inconvenience to major system failures requiring expensive repairs.
