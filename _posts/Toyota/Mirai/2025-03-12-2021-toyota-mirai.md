The 2021 Toyota Mirai is a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) offering a unique and environmentally conscious driving experience. It is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell that produces electricity to drive an electric motor, with water as the only emission. The electric motor delivers 182 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Mirai for its near-silent operation, smooth ride, and futuristic styling. However, the limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure and range anxiety are common concerns.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**
* **Inverter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The inverter, which converts DC power from the fuel cell to AC power for the motor, can fail. This can cause a loss of power, warning lights on the dashboard, and potentially the vehicle entering limp mode or shutting down completely.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty inverter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Fuel Cell System**

**Fuel Cell System**
* **Hydrogen Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Although rare, hydrogen leaks can occur in the fuel cell system. This would trigger a warning light. In some cases there may be a detectable odor near the leak if large enough.
    * Solution: Leak detection, repair/replacement of faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the source of the leak, could range from $500 - $10,000+ depending on component.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Cell Stack Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time, the fuel cell stack can degrade, reducing its efficiency and power output. Symptoms include decreased range, reduced acceleration, and increased hydrogen consumption. This could be due to fuel cell membrane degradation, catalyst poisoning, or other factors.
    * Solution: Replacement of the fuel cell stack. This is a major repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**General Electrical**
* **12V Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery, used for starting the car and powering accessories, can fail prematurely. This leads to issues like the car not starting, warning lights illuminating, and electrical malfunctions.
    * Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Software Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Infotainment system malfunctions, navigation errors, and issues with the driver-assistance systems are possible, but not super common.
    * Solution: Software updates and potentially component replacements.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update) to $1,000+ (if hardware replacement is required).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**General Exterior**
* **Hydrogen Refueling Door Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The door that covers the hydrogen refueling port may have issues opening or closing properly.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the door mechanism.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

**General Interior**
* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes.
    * Solution: Software update, system reset, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,500+ (unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Toyota Mirai, while innovative, can experience issues ranging from relatively minor electrical glitches to more significant fuel cell system problems. The most concerning and costly potential issue is fuel cell stack degradation. Inverter failure and Hydrogen Leaks can also be expensive repairs. While less severe, issues like 12V battery problems and infotainment glitches can still be frustrating. The costs associated with these repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific issue and the necessary parts and labor.
