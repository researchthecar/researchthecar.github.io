# 2018 Toyota Mirai

### Overview
The 2018 Toyota Mirai represents a significant step in automotive innovation, being a fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV). Its powertrain operates on hydrogen, producing electricity to power an electric motor, with water vapor as the only emission. This advanced technology generally translates to a reliable driving experience, with fewer traditional mechanical components prone to wear compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. However, the Mirai's unique hydrogen fuel cell system and its associated infrastructure present a different set of considerations for owners. Reliability data for FCEVs is still evolving, but the 2018 Mirai has shown a strong track record in its core systems.
