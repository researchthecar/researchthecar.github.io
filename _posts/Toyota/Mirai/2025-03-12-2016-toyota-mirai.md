The 2016 Toyota Mirai is a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) that produces electricity from hydrogen and emits only water. It was offered with a single powertrain option: a 113 kW (151 hp) electric motor and a 114 kW (153 hp) fuel cell stack, providing 247 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the Mirai's zero-emission driving and unique styling. Common dislikes include limited range (compared to gasoline vehicles), the scarcity of hydrogen fueling stations, and the high cost of hydrogen fuel.

    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-voltage converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Hydrogen Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hydrogen fuel system can develop leaks over time due to degradation of seals and connections. This can be detected by a sulfur or rotten egg smell near the fuel tank.
    *   Solution: Replacement of fuel lines and connectors and inspection of the fuel tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: **17V-093** - Hydrogen Gas Leak

*   **Fuel Cell Cooling System Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks in the fuel cell system can cause overheating or damage to the system. This may be indicated by a low coolant level and a warning light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel cell cooling system components and coolant flush.

**Summary**
The 2016 Toyota Mirai, while innovative, has a few notable issues. The primary concern revolves around the hydrogen fuel cell stack, which can degrade over time. Addressing these issues can be costly, particularly the fuel cell stack replacement. Other issues include fuel cell cooling system leaks and infotainment system problems. Addressing these issues can range from moderate to very expensive, potentially impacting the overall cost of ownership. While hydrogen leakage is a concern, it can be mitigated by addressing the safety recall.
