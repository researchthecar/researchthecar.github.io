The 2024 Toyota Mirai is a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) sedan. It is only available with a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain which generates electricity to power an electric motor. This electric motor produces 182 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Drivers appreciate the Mirai for its near-silent operation, comfortable ride, and futuristic design. However, limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure and the higher cost compared to traditional gasoline vehicles can be drawbacks.
