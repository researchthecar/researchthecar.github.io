The 2017 Toyota Mirai is a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, meaning it uses hydrogen to generate electricity to power an electric motor. It was only available with a single powertrain configuration. The Mirai produces 151 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Mirai for its futuristic technology and zero-emission driving, while common complaints revolve around the limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure and the vehicle's unconventional styling.

**Summary**

The 2017 Toyota Mirai has a few common problems. Most common are the fuel cell stack degradation, hydrogen leakage, and door handle issues. While some are relatively inexpensive to repair, some issues like fuel cell degradation can be expensive. The Mirai's dependency on hydrogen fuel cell tech makes it a unique car, but also limits the infrastructure it can support and the potential problems it can have.
