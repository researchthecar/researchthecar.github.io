The 2018 Toyota Mirai is a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle that produces 151 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. It has a single-speed direct drive transmission. Owners often praise the Mirai for its futuristic technology, quiet ride, and zero emissions. However, some criticisms include limited range, the scarcity of hydrogen fueling stations, and the unconventional styling.

**Electric Motor**

**Fuel Cell Electric**
*   **Fuel Cell Stack Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced range, decreased performance, and eventual failure of the fuel cell stack. Some owners have reported premature degradation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel cell stack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50,000 - $80,000+ (This is a very expensive repair and might be covered under warranty depending on mileage and terms)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydrogen Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hydrogen leaks from the fuel cell system, triggering warning lights or alarms.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the affected components (e.g., fuel lines, valves, sensors) and conducting a leak test after the repair to ensure no further leak issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Single-Speed Direct Drive**
*   **Unusual Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining, humming, or clicking noises coming from the transmission area, especially during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the transmission and replacement of any worn bearings or gears. In some cases, a complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Knocking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, uneven tire wear, and diminished ride quality.
    * Solution: Replacing worn components such as control arms, bushings, and shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery, which powers accessories and starts the vehicle's systems, can drain prematurely. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or electrical malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery and diagnosis of the underlying cause of the drain (e.g., parasitic draw, faulty charging system).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Software Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the infotainment system, navigation, or other electronic functions, leading to system freezes, unresponsive screens, or inaccurate information.
    *   Solution: Software updates or replacement of the affected module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Voltage System Errors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights or error messages related to the high voltage fuel cell system. This can range from minor sensor issues to more significant problems with the fuel cell stack or related components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the high voltage system and repair or replacement of faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $80,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Hydrogen Fuel Door Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the hydrogen fuel door, which can prevent refueling.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the fuel door latch mechanism or related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, or navigation system errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates, hardware repair, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning air conditioning or heating, inconsistent airflow, or unusual noises from the HVAC system.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the AC compressor, blower motor, or other HVAC components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Toyota Mirai, while innovative, does present some specific concerns. The most significant is the potential for fuel cell stack degradation, a very costly repair. Electrical issues, particularly with the 12V battery and high voltage system, are also relatively common. Other issues, such as suspension wear and infotainment glitches, are more typical of vehicles in this class. The severity and cost of repairs can vary greatly, with some requiring expensive component replacements. Potential buyers should carefully consider the Mirai's reliability record and the availability of qualified service technicians before making a purchase. Given the complexity and cost associated with the fuel cell system, extended warranties are highly recommended.
