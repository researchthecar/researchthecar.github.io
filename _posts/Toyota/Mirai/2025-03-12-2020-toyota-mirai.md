The 2020 Toyota Mirai is a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (FCV) producing 151 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. It utilizes a single-speed transmission. Owners often praise the Mirai for its near-silent operation, comfortable ride, and innovative technology. Common complaints include limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure, a relatively high price point, and the vehicle's unconventional styling.

**Electric Motor**

* **Fuel Cell Stack Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced range, decreased power output, and eventual failure of the fuel cell stack. This is a known issue with early FCV technology as the fuel cell membrane degrades over time. Symptoms include a noticeable decline in the vehicle's performance and range, potentially leading to a warning light on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replacement of the fuel cell stack.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: High, likely exceeding $10,000 depending on labor and parts availability.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **High Voltage Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature degradation or failure of the high-voltage battery pack that supports the fuel cell system. Symptoms can include reduced range, warning lights, and the vehicle entering a limp mode.
    * Solution: Replacement of the high-voltage battery pack.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Single-Speed Transmission**
* **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension System Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 2020 Mirai features an air suspension system. Failures can manifest as uneven ride height, a harsh ride, or the vehicle sagging on one or more corners. This can be caused by leaks in the air lines, malfunctioning air struts, or a faulty air compressor.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to determine the specific failing component. Replacement of air struts, air lines, or the air compressor as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the component.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Hydrogen System Component Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Fuel cell vehicles rely on a complex system for managing hydrogen flow and storage. Sensors, valves, and regulators can malfunction, leading to error codes, reduced performance, or complete system shutdown.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty component. Replacement or repair of the hydrogen system component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ depending on the component.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches such as freezing, lagging, or failure to connect to smartphones.
    * Solution: Software updates, system reset, or replacement of the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,500+ (head unit replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Hydrogen Leak Detection System False Alarms**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Mirai is equipped with a hydrogen leak detection system, which can trigger false alarms. This can be caused by sensor malfunction or sensitivity to environmental factors.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and recalibration or replacement of the hydrogen leak sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Summary:**

The 2020 Toyota Mirai, while technologically advanced, has some potential issues. The most significant concern revolves around the fuel cell stack degradation, which could lead to very costly repairs. Other electrical issues, along with the air suspension, also contribute to potential maintenance costs. The severity of these issues ranges from inconvenient glitches to major system failures.
