# 2020 Toyota Mirai

### Overview
The 2020 Toyota Mirai, a pioneer in hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), represents a significant step in alternative powertrain technology. Its unique system, which generates electricity onboard from hydrogen, offers zero tailpipe emissions and a driving experience akin to a battery electric vehicle, but with the convenience of faster refueling. Reliability data for FCEVs like the Mirai is still developing compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. However, early indications and Toyota's reputation for robust engineering suggest a generally high level of dependability, particularly in its core powertrain components. This analysis focuses on documented issues beyond standard maintenance, reflecting the specific nature of its advanced technology.

## Engine

### Fuel Cell Stack
**Reduced Power Output**
- **Symptoms:** Noticeable decrease in acceleration and overall vehicle performance. May be accompanied by dashboard warning lights related to the fuel cell system.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential recalibration or replacement of fuel cell stack components. Toyota's warranty typically covers this for an extended period.
- **Cost:** $5,000 - $15,000 (out of warranty)

**Hydrogen Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Faint smell of hydrogen, potential loss of power, and specific warning indicators on the dashboard. Safety systems are designed to mitigate risks.
- **Solution:** Immediate inspection by a certified technician to identify and repair the leak in the hydrogen storage or delivery system.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2,500

### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Toyota Mirai demonstrates strong reliability, particularly in its innovative fuel cell powertrain, benefiting from Toyota's extensive experience with hybrid and electric technologies. While the fuel cell stack itself is generally robust, potential issues like reduced power output or rare hydrogen leaks are the most significant concerns, though often covered by warranty. The 12V auxiliary battery is a common point of failure across many vehicle types, including the Mirai. Electrical and interior systems show minor software-related glitches, but these are typically resolved with updates. Overall, the Mirai is a reliable vehicle, with its unique technology presenting specific, but manageable, potential repair considerations outside of standard maintenance.
