## Engine

### Fuel Cell Stack
**Reduced Power Output**
- **Symptoms:** Noticeable decrease in acceleration and overall power, potentially accompanied by dashboard warning lights related to the fuel cell system.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential replacement or refurbishment of fuel cell stack components. This is a complex repair requiring specialized knowledge and equipment.
- **Cost:** $5,000 - $15,000+

**Hydrogen Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Audible hissing sounds from the hydrogen system, potential 'rotten egg' smell (though often undetectable by humans), and dashboard warnings indicating a hydrogen leak.
- **Solution:** Immediate inspection and repair of the hydrogen storage tanks, lines, and seals by qualified technicians. Safety is paramount.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2,500


### Electric Motor
**No Major Issues**
- **Symptoms:** No widespread issues reported.
- **Solution:** No widespread issues reported.
