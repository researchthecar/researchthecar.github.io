The 2022 Toyota Mirai is a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), offering a unique alternative to traditional gasoline cars and battery electric vehicles. It is only offered with a fuel cell electric motor powertrain, rated at 182 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Mirai for its smooth, quiet ride, futuristic styling, and zero-emission operation. However, the limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure and higher price point are commonly cited drawbacks.

**Fuel Cell Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Power Output**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported reduced power output or sluggish acceleration, especially when the hydrogen fuel tank is low or in cold weather conditions.
    *   Solution: Some issues can be resolved by performing a fuel cell system reset at the dealership. In other cases, the fuel cell stack may need to be inspected and potentially replaced under warranty if a more serious issue is found.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dependent on the issue. A reset may be covered under the warranty or cost around $100. A fuel cell stack replacement can be a substantial repair covered under the 8-year/100,000-mile fuel cell component warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydrogen Fueling Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty refueling at certain hydrogen stations, or experiencing slow fill times. This is often attributed to station issues rather than the vehicle itself. Also, difficulty filling the tank to its maximum level, resulting in a reduced driving range.
    *   Solution: Try different hydrogen stations and report issues to the station operator. The vehicle's fuel tank and fueling system can also be inspected for any mechanical issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Inspection may be covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent freezing, lagging, or unexpected reboots of the infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset, updating the software, or, in some cases, replacing the entire infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free at the dealership. Replacement of the infotainment unit could range from $500 - $1500+, depending on labor and parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Hydrogen Leakage Warning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alarms related to hydrogen leakage detected by the vehicle's sensors. This typically triggers a warning light and may limit vehicle operation.
    *   Solution: The sensors may need to be recalibrated or replaced. In rare cases, there may be an actual leak that requires repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Sensor recalibration or replacement could cost $200 - $500. Leak repair will vary depending on the severity and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2022 Toyota Mirai generally exhibits few major issues. The most significant concerns relate to the fuel cell system's performance and refueling challenges, which are sometimes related to the limited hydrogen infrastructure. Electrical glitches in the infotainment system are also noted. The cost of repair varies greatly depending on the issue, with fuel cell component replacements potentially being the most expensive. However, many of these repairs are covered under the vehicle's extensive fuel cell component warranty.
