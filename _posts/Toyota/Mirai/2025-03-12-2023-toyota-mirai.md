The 2023 Toyota Mirai is a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). It is only available with a single powertrain option: an electric motor powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The electric motor produces 182 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the Mirai's quiet and smooth ride, unique design, and zero emissions driving. However, limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure, high fuel costs, and limited range compared to gasoline vehicles are common complaints.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Power/Failure to Start**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of reduced power output or complete failure to start. This can be attributed to issues with the fuel cell stack itself, high voltage system malfunctions or software issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a certified Toyota technician is required to pinpoint the cause. The fuel cell stack, high voltage components, or related sensors may need to be replaced or reprogrammed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis can range from $150 - $300, while the replacement of major components such as the fuel cell stack can cost upwards of $10,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Cell Stack Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the fuel cell stack can degrade, leading to reduced power output and efficiency. This is more prevalent in regions with extreme temperatures or inconsistent hydrogen quality.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel cell stack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Mirai uses an air suspension system. Some owners have reported issues with the system failing to maintain the correct ride height, leading to a bumpy or uneven ride. This can be due to leaks in the air lines, a failing compressor, or faulty sensors.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the air suspension system to identify the leaking lines, failing compressor, or faulty sensors. These parts are then replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Software Glitches/Infotainment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported occasional glitches with the infotainment system, including freezing, slow response times, and connectivity problems with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Toyota can often resolve these issues. In some cases, a replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are usually free. Infotainment unit replacement can range from $800 - $2000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Hydrogen Refueling Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mirai relies on hydrogen refueling stations, which are limited in number and can be unreliable. Owners have reported issues with stations being out of service or having insufficient pressure, making refueling difficult.
    *   Solution: This is largely dependent on the development and expansion of hydrogen infrastructure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A - Infrastructure dependent.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced problems with the HVAC system, including inconsistent cooling or heating, unusual noises, or failure to blow air at the selected temperature.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a certified technician to identify the faulty components, such as the compressor, blower motor, or control module. Replacement of the affected parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Toyota Mirai, while technologically advanced and environmentally friendly, has reported issues primarily centered around its unique hydrogen fuel cell powertrain, electrical components, and air suspension. The most significant concern involves potential fuel cell stack degradation and high-voltage system issues, which can lead to substantial repair costs. Other issues, such as infotainment glitches and HVAC malfunctions, are less severe but can still impact the overall ownership experience. The limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure also presents a major challenge for Mirai owners. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, especially considering the high cost of specialized repairs associated with this vehicle.
