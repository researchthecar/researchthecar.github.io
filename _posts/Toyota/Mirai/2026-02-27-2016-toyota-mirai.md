# 2016 Toyota Mirai

### Overview
The 2016 Toyota Mirai, a pioneering fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), represents a significant step in automotive innovation. Its powertrain relies on a hydrogen fuel cell stack to generate electricity, which then powers an electric motor. This technology offers zero tailpipe emissions and a driving experience akin to a conventional electric vehicle, with instant torque and quiet operation. While the underlying electric drivetrain is generally robust, the Mirai's unique fuel cell system introduces specific considerations for long-term reliability and maintenance. Owners should be aware of the specialized nature of the hydrogen infrastructure and the components involved in the fuel cell stack's operation. Overall, the 2016 model year, being an early iteration, has shown commendable reliability for its advanced technology, though some components require specialized attention.
