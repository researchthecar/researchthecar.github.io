The 2006 Toyota Hilux is a robust and reliable pickup truck known for its durability and off-road capability. This model year was offered with a range of engine options, including the 2.7L inline-4 gasoline engine (2TR-FE) producing around 160 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, the 4.0L V6 gasoline engine (1GR-FE) producing around 236 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, and several diesel engine options. Transmission choices typically included a 5-speed manual and a 4- or 5-speed automatic depending on the engine and market. Owners often praise the Hilux for its longevity, dependability, and strong resale value. Conversely, some common complaints revolve around ride comfort, fuel economy (especially with the larger engines), and the relatively basic interior compared to more modern trucks.
