The 2022 Toyota Hilux is a popular pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Engine options include a 2.4L turbo diesel (147 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 2.8L turbo diesel (201 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque for manual, 369-420 lb-ft for automatic depending on the market), and a 2.7L gasoline engine (164 hp, 181 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options generally consist of a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic, depending on the engine and market. Owners generally appreciate the Hilux's ruggedness and dependability, while some criticisms include ride comfort and potentially dated interior features compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.8L Turbo Diesel**

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: DPF can become clogged prematurely, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and warning lights on the dashboard. This is often related to driving patterns that don't allow the DPF to regenerate properly.
    * Solution: Forced regeneration by a mechanic, or replacement of the DPF. Sometimes changing driving habits to include longer trips at higher speeds can prevent recurrence.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$2000+ depending on the solution.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Fuel Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Higher than expected fuel consumption, especially in urban driving conditions.
    * Solution: Not always a specific fix. Ensuring proper tire inflation, regular maintenance, and adjusting driving habits can help. Check for diesel leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Depends on the cause
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbo, loss of power, potentially accompanied by warning lights.
    * Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ depending on parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Turbo Diesel**

* **Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, black smoke from the exhaust, and reduced power.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.7L Gasoline**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, particularly when cold.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement, or software update. In severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (fluid/filter), $1000 - $3000+ (valve body/rebuild).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noise coming from the rear suspension, especially over bumps.
    * Solution: Lubrication of leaf spring bushings, or replacement of the bushings if worn.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (lubrication), $200 - $500+ (bushing replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, or unresponsive touchscreen. Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    * Solution: Software update or replacement of the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: May be covered under warranty if software. Otherwise, $500 - $1500+ for replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., parking sensors, blind spot monitoring)**
    * Description/Symptoms: False alarms, failure to detect objects, or complete system failure.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of faulty sensor(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust Issues (Specific Regions)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on body panels, particularly in areas with high salt exposure (coastal regions or areas where roads are salted in winter).
    * Solution: Rust repair and repainting. Application of rust preventative measures.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable depending on the extent of the rust damage, $300 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Rattles**
    * Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattles coming from the dashboard area, especially on rough roads.
    * Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and applying padding or tightening loose components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Depends on the severity of the rattle and if a mechanic is needed. $50 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Toyota Hilux generally maintains Toyota's reputation for reliability, but some common issues exist. The diesel engines are prone to DPF issues, turbocharger problems, and injector failure. The automatic transmission can exhibit rough shifting. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and sensors are also reported. Rust is a concern in specific environments. The cost to fix these issues can range from minor expenses for squeaks and rattles to significant amounts for engine or transmission repairs. While some issues are widespread, others appear to be isolated incidents.
