The 2017 Toyota Hilux is a popular pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Engine options for this model year include a 2.4L Turbo Diesel (2GD-FTV) producing 147 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque and a 2.8L Turbo Diesel (1GD-FTV) producing 174 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque (depending on the region and transmission). Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Hilux for its durability and dependability, while some common complaints include its ride comfort and relatively basic interior compared to competitors.

**Summary**

The 2017 Toyota Hilux, while generally reliable, can experience some common issues. Engine injector failures, particularly in both the 2.4L and 2.8L diesel engines, can be costly to repair. DPF issues are also worth noting for diesel variants. The 6-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting, potentially requiring valve body work or a full transmission replacement. Suspension and electrical issues can also appear. Depending on the issue, the cost to repair can be substantial, so a thorough inspection before purchase is recommended.
