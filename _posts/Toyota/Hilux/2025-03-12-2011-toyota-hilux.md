The 2011 Toyota Hilux is a popular pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Engine options for the 2011 Hilux typically included a 2.5L D-4D diesel (producing around 142 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L D-4D diesel, and a 2.7L gasoline engine. Available transmissions are usually a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine and region.

Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the specific problem and location, but some of the more extensive repairs, such as engine or transmission work, can be quite expensive. The gasoline engine seems to have less issues overall compared to the diesel options.
