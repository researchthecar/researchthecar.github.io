The 2008 Toyota Hilux is a rugged and reliable pickup truck known for its durability and off-road capability. Available with several engine options, including the 2.7L inline-4 gasoline engine (around 158 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque), the 4.0L V6 gasoline engine (around 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque), and the 2.5L and 3.0L D-4D diesel engines, it caters to a range of needs. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed or 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine and market. Owners often praise the Hilux for its longevity and go-anywhere attitude, while some criticisms include the somewhat basic interior and ride comfort compared to newer trucks.
