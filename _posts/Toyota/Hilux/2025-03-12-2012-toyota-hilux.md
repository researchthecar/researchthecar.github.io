The 2012 Toyota Hilux is a rugged and reliable pickup truck known for its durability and off-road capability. Engine options for this year include a 2.7L inline-four gasoline engine (approximately 158 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque), a 4.0L V6 gasoline engine (approximately 236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L inline-four turbo diesel engine (approximately 169 hp and 253 lb-ft of torque, exact figures may vary by region). Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, and a 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine and market. Owners generally appreciate the Hilux for its toughness and longevity. Common dislikes often include a relatively basic interior compared to some competitors, and fuel economy, particularly with the gasoline engines.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline-Four Gasoline**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the 2.7L engine consuming more oil than expected, especially at higher mileage. This may manifest as the need to add oil between changes or seeing blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels. If consumption is high, a compression test can help determine if piston rings or valve stem seals are the cause. Repair could involve replacing these components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the cause and scope of repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**4.0L V6 Gasoline**

* **Cracked Exhaust Manifold**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking sound at cold start that diminishes as the engine warms up. This is often due to cracks in the exhaust manifold.
    * Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Inline-Four Turbo Diesel**
* **Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, poor fuel economy, excessive black smoke, and potential engine misfires. Fault codes related to specific injectors may be present.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty injectors. Recoding of the new injectors to the ECU may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ depending on the number of injectors needing replacement and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noise from the turbocharger, loss of power, black or blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    * Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the turbocharger. Inspection of the oil feed and drain lines for blockage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**
* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, especially between certain gears.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might improve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body repair or replacement could be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1500+ depending on the severity of the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard (battery light), slow engine cranking, or complete electrical failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Chassis/Frame**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible rust on the chassis, particularly in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure. This can lead to structural weakening over time.
    * Solution: Rust removal and treatment with rust inhibitors. In severe cases, welding repairs or frame replacement may be needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+ depending on severity
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**
* **Air Conditioning Compressor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning not blowing cold air, unusual noises from the compressor, or the A/C clutch not engaging.
    * Solution: Replacement of the air conditioning compressor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**
The 2012 Toyota Hilux generally has minor issues, but some problems such as chassis rust, turbocharger failures, and injector failures on the diesel engine can be costly to repair if left unaddressed. The cracked exhaust manifolds and excessive oil consumption of the gasoline engines can be more common problems, but may not be as expensive to repair. It is important to have the vehicle inspected before purchase to get the extent of these issues.
