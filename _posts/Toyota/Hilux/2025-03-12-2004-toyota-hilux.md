    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clogging of the EGR valve due to carbon buildup, leading to rough idling, poor performance, and increased emissions.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+

**2.0L 1TR-FE Gasoline Engine**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or jerky shifts between gears, especially when cold. This can be caused by worn transmission fluid, faulty solenoids, or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the transmission fluid, repair or replace faulty solenoids, or rebuild/replace the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement).

*   **Slipping Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips out of gear or hesitates during acceleration. This is often caused by worn clutch packs or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Check and top up transmission fluid, or rebuild/replace the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid top-up) - $3000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement).

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Hard Shifting/Grinding Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting into gear, especially first and second, accompanied by a grinding noise. This is often caused by worn synchronizers or a failing clutch.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch, repair or replace the synchronizers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Leaf Springs**

**Summary**

The 2004 Toyota Hilux is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any vehicle of its age, it is prone to certain issues. The most common problems are related to the engine (oil leaks, injector failure for diesel engines), transmission (rough shifting), suspension (worn leaf springs and shocks), and electrical system (alternator failure). Rust can also be a significant issue, especially in regions with harsh winters. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some being relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, while others require more extensive and costly repairs. It is advisable to thoroughly inspect any potential Hilux purchase, paying close attention to these common problem areas.
