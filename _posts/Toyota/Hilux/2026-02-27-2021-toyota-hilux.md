### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Toyota Hilux demonstrates a high level of technical reliability, consistent with Toyota's reputation. The diesel engines, particularly the 2.4L and 2.8L variants, are generally robust but can be susceptible to Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) issues if regeneration cycles are not completed properly, especially in urban driving conditions. Turbocharger wear and cooling system leaks are also potential, though not widespread, concerns for these diesel engines. The petrol engine and both transmission options show excellent reliability with no significant reported issues. Suspension components, specifically leaf springs, may require attention under heavy use or over time. Electrical system battery drain is a possibility that requires proper diagnosis. Overall, the Hilux is a dependable vehicle, with most potential issues being manageable and not indicative of systemic design flaws.
