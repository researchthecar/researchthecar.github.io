### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Toyota Hilux demonstrates strong overall reliability, consistent with Toyota's reputation. The diesel engines, particularly the 3.0L, are generally robust but can experience issues like injector problems or EGR valve malfunctions, which are not uncommon for high-mileage diesel vehicles. The 2.5L diesel has potential turbocharger and glow plug concerns. The petrol engine is largely trouble-free. Transmission issues are typically related to wear and tear on clutches for manuals or potential leaks in automatics. Suspension components like leaf springs and shock absorbers may require attention on older, heavily used models. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain environments. Interior issues are generally minor, with the AC system being a common point of attention. Despite these points, the Hilux remains a highly dependable choice for its intended purpose.
