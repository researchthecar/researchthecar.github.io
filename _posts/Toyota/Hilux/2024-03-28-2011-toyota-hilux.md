**Introduction:** The 2011 Toyota Hilux is a mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capabilities. It's available with various engine and transmission options, including a 2.5-liter diesel engine with a 5-speed manual transmission and a 3.0-liter diesel engine with a 5-speed automatic transmission. While the Hilux is generally well-received, it has some reported issues.

**Engine**

**2.5-liter Diesel Engine**

* **EGR Valve Failure:** The EGR valve can fail, leading to reduced engine power and increased emissions.
* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail, resulting in reduced boost pressure and decreased engine performance.
* **Fuel Injector Failure:** The fuel injectors can fail, causing rough idling, reduced fuel economy, and increased emissions.

**3.0-liter Diesel Engine**

* **Cylinder Head Gasket Failure:** The cylinder head gasket can fail, leading to coolant leakage and potential engine damage.
* **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt can fail prematurely, causing severe engine damage.
* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues:** The DPF can become clogged, resulting in reduced engine power and increased emissions.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Clutch Slave Cylinder Failure:** The clutch slave cylinder can fail, making it difficult to shift gears.
* **Gear Linkage Wear:** The gear linkage can wear out, leading to difficulty shifting into certain gears.

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Slippage:** The transmission may slip gears, causing a loss of power and acceleration.
* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** The transmission may leak fluid, leading to slipping and shifting issues.

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension Coil Spring Breakage:** The front suspension coil springs can break prematurely, resulting in a bumpy ride and reduced handling.
* **Rear Suspension Leaf Spring Sag:** The rear suspension leaf springs can sag over time, leading to a reduced load capacity and decreased ride quality.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, leading to a loss of electrical power and potential battery discharge.
* **Battery Discharge:** The battery can discharge prematurely due to electrical system issues or parasitic drain.
* **Wiring Harness Issues:** The wiring harness can develop faults, causing electrical malfunctions and intermittent issues.

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** The body panels can rust prematurely, especially in areas exposed to salt or moisture.

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioner Failure:** The air conditioner may fail due to compressor issues or refrigerant leaks.
* **Window Regulator Failure:** The window regulators can fail, making it difficult to open or close the windows.
* **Dashboard Cracking:** The dashboard can develop cracks over time, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.

**Summary:** While the 2011 Toyota Hilux is generally reliable, it has some reported issues. Engine and transmission problems can be severe and expensive to fix, while suspension and electrical issues are less severe and less costly. Exterior and interior issues are generally minor and do not typically affect the overall performance or reliability of the vehicle.
