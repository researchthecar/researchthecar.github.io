The 2013 Toyota Hilux is a rugged and reliable pickup truck known for its durability and off-road capabilities. It's a popular choice for both work and recreational use. Engine options vary depending on the market, but commonly include the 2.5L D-4D diesel (around 142 hp and 253 lb-ft of torque), the 3.0L D-4D diesel (around 169 hp and 265 lb-ft of torque), and the 2.7L gasoline engine (around 158 hp and 177 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, and a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Hilux for its toughness, reliability, and resale value. Common dislikes include relatively basic interior features and fuel economy (especially on the gasoline engine).

**Summary**

The 2013 Toyota Hilux, while generally reliable, can experience some common issues. The most significant problems revolve around the diesel engines (injector failure on the 2.5L and turbo/DPF issues on the 3.0L) which can lead to costly repairs. Suspension issues, particularly leaf spring sag, are also prevalent. Electrical issues such as alternator and ABS sensor failures can also occur. Rust, depending on the vehicle's location and history, can also be a concern. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like turbocharger replacement, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, especially diesel engines, for signs of these common issues.
