**Summary**

The 2019 Toyota Hilux, while generally reliable, does have some reported issues. The most significant issues seem to be related to the 2.8L turbo diesel engine, specifically DPF problems and injector failures, which can be costly to repair. The 6-speed automatic transmission can exhibit harsh shifting and torque converter shudder, requiring fluid changes or more extensive repairs. Interior rattling and dashboard cracking are also common complaints, particularly in hotter climates. While these issues can be bothersome, they are not necessarily widespread, and the Hilux generally maintains its reputation for durability. The severity and cost of repairs vary significantly depending on the specific issue.
