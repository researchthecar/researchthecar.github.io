The 2019 Toyota Highlander is a popular three-row SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 (FWD Only), a 3.5L V6 (FWD/AWD) producing 295 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 Hybrid powertrain (AWD). The 2.5L is paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission while the V6 is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.
