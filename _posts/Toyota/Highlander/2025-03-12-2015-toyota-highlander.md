The 2015 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It was offered with three powertrain options: a 2.7L 4-cylinder engine (185 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L V6 engine (270 hp, 248 lb-ft of torque), and a hybrid powertrain. The 2.7L engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.5L V6 was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid was paired with a CVT. Owners generally praise the Highlander for its dependability, smooth ride, and ample cargo space. Common complaints include the infotainment system's complexity, and some find the styling to be somewhat bland.
