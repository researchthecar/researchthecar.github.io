The 2011 Toyota Highlander is a mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It was offered with a 2.7L inline-4 engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque or a 3.5L V6 engine producing 270 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. The inline-4 was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 came with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Highlander's dependability and family-friendly features, but some dislike the somewhat bland styling and occasional maintenance costs associated with an older vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2011 Toyota Highlander is generally a reliable vehicle. The most significant potential issues include the VVTi oil line leak on V6 models and higher than normal oil consumption on the 2.7L inline-4. Other common issues like power door lock actuator failure and rear hatch strut failure are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix. Addressing potential issues proactively, such as replacing the VVTi oil line with the updated version, can help prevent more costly repairs down the road. Overall, the 2011 Highlander offers good value and reliability, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing.
