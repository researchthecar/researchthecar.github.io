**Introduction:**

The 2002 Toyota Highlander is a mid-size SUV that was offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 2.4-liter inline-four engine that produced 155 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine was a 3.0-liter V6 engine that produced 220 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Highlander received positive reviews for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. However, some owners have reported issues with the vehicle's engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical system.
