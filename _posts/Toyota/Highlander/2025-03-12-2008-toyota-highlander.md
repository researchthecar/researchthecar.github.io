The 2008 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.7L inline-4 (187 hp, 186 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.5L V6 (270 hp, 248 lb-ft of torque). The V6 was generally preferred for its added power, making it better suited for hauling cargo and passengers. People liked the Highlander for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and reputation for longevity. Common dislikes included somewhat bland styling and, in the case of the I4 engine, a lack of power for a vehicle of its size.
