The 2006 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability and practicality. It offered a comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and an optional third-row seat. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common problems. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 155 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 producing 215 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Highlander's dependability and smooth ride, but some dislike its somewhat bland styling and occasional electronic issues.
