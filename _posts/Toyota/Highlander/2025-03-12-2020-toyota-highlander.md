The 2020 Toyota Highlander represents the beginning of the fourth generation of this popular mid-size SUV. While generally regarded for its reliability, like any vehicle, it has its share of reported issues. The most common engine is the 3.5L V6 (2GR-FKS) producing 295 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 2.5L 4-cylinder hybrid. The 3.5L V6 is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission (UA80E). People often praise the Highlander for its comfortable ride, spacious interior (especially the first two rows), and strong resale value. Common complaints involve the cramped third-row seating, somewhat uninspired driving dynamics, and the infotainment system's dated interface.
