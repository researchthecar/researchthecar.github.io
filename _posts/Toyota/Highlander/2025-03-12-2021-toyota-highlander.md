The 2021 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It offers two powertrain options: a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 295 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder hybrid engine with a combined system output of 243 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Highlander for its smooth ride, fuel efficiency (especially the hybrid), and comprehensive suite of safety features. Some common complaints include the infotainment system being dated or cumbersome to use, some road noise in the cabin, and the third-row seating being somewhat cramped for adults.
