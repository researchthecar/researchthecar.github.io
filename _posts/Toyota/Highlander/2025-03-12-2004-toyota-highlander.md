The 2004 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability and practicality. Engine options include a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine producing 160 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque and a 3.3L V6 engine producing 230 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque. The V6 version is generally preferred for its improved performance and towing capacity. Both engines came paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Highlander's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes include lackluster fuel economy, particularly with the V6, and some reports of age-related issues surfacing as the vehicles get older.
