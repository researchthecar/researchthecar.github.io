The 2007 Toyota Highlander is a mid-size SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and comfortable ride. It offered three engine options: a 2.4L 4-cylinder (FWD only), a 3.3L V6 (215 hp, 222 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.5L V6 (270 hp, 248 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options include a 5-speed automatic (for the 4-cylinder and 3.3L V6) and a 5-speed automatic (for the 3.5L V6). Owners appreciate the Highlander's spacious interior, smooth handling, and Toyota's reputation for longevity. However, some common complaints include higher fuel consumption than advertised and, depending on the configuration, some specific mechanical issues related to age.

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. Often noticed when the transmission is trying to lock the torque converter.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush with Toyota WS fluid. If the shudder persists, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
