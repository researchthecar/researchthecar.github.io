The 2002 Toyota Highlander marked the beginning of a popular crossover SUV. It offered a blend of car-like handling with SUV practicality. Two engine options were available: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 155 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L V6 generating 220 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque. The Highlander was generally praised for its reliability, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Some common complaints included subpar fuel economy, especially with the V6, and some reported issues with specific components as the vehicle aged.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, often stemming from the valve cover gasket and the rear main seal. Visible oil puddles under the vehicle, burning oil smell, and low oil levels are indicators.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket and/or rear main seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for valve cover gasket, $400 - $800+ for rear main seal.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust can be a symptom.
    * Solution: In some cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary. However, given the age of the vehicle, switching to a higher viscosity oil might be a more economical solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ for piston ring replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.4L, oil leaks are a common occurrence. The valve cover gaskets and rear main seal are prime suspects.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets and/or rear main seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for valve cover gaskets, $400 - $800+ for rear main seal.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sludge Buildup**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 3.0L V6 engine, if not properly maintained with regular oil changes, can be prone to sludge buildup. This can lead to reduced oil flow and potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil are crucial. In severe cases, engine flushing or even engine disassembly and cleaning might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for engine flush, $1000+ for engine disassembly and cleaning.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Both Engine Options**
* **Shift Problems/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift are potential problems. These symptoms can indicate low transmission fluid, worn clutches, or a faulty valve body.
    * Solution: Check and replace the transmission fluid first. If the problem persists, a valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for fluid change, $500 - $1000+ for valve body replacement, $2000 - $4000+ for transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut/Shock Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Worn struts and shocks can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace worn struts and shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per axle (pair).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rust/Corrosion of Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: In areas with heavy road salt use, rust and corrosion can weaken suspension components, leading to failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of corroded components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the component. Could range from a few hundred dollars to over a thousand.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate, often due to a faulty window motor or regulator.
    * Solution: Replace the window motor and/or regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per window.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, a dead battery, and a warning light on the dashboard can indicate a failing alternator.
    * Solution: Replace the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust (Body)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can occur, especially in areas with salt, on the lower body panels, wheel wells, and other areas prone to moisture.
    * Solution: Rust repair, which can range from sanding and painting small spots to replacing entire panels.

**Summary**

The 2002 Toyota Highlander, while generally reliable, has potential issues related to oil leaks, transmission problems, and suspension wear, especially as it ages. The severity and cost of these issues can vary greatly depending on the vehicle's maintenance history and location. Oil leaks and suspension issues tend to be relatively inexpensive to address, while transmission problems and significant rust repair can be more costly. Overall, a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended to assess the vehicle's condition and potential for future repairs.
