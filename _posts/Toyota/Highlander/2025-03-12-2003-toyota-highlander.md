The 2003 Toyota Highlander is a mid-size SUV known for its reliability and practicality. Engine options included a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine producing 160 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine producing 220 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque. The V6 was generally preferred for its smoother power delivery and better performance. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Highlander for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and Toyota's reputation for longevity. Common complaints often revolved around age-related wear and tear, such as rust and failing sensors.
