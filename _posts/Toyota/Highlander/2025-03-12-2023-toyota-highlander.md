The 2023 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It offers two powertrain options: a 2.4L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 265 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor in a hybrid configuration (243 horsepower combined). The turbocharged engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid uses a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Highlander's fuel efficiency, smooth ride, and reputation for dependability. However, some criticisms include a less engaging driving experience compared to some competitors, and the infotainment system's user interface.
