The 2013 Toyota Highlander is a mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.7L inline-4 producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 270 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consist of a 6-speed automatic on the V6 and an older 5-speed auto on the I4. Owners appreciate the Highlander for its longevity and resale value. Common dislikes often involve its somewhat bland styling and limited third-row legroom.

**Summary**

The 2013 Toyota Highlander generally holds up well, but like any vehicle, it has its common issues. The water pump and oil cooler line leaks on the 3.5L V6 engine are potential concerns. The 6-speed automatic transmission can develop harsh shifting problems, but most issues are not catastrophic. Suspension and electrical problems are fairly typical for a vehicle of this age. Overall, while issues exist, the severity and cost are generally moderate, making the 2013 Highlander a decent used vehicle choice with proper inspection and maintenance.
