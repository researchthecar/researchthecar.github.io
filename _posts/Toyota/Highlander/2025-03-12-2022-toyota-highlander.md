The 2022 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, comfort, and spaciousness. The standard engine is a 3.5L V6 producing 295 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid powertrain is also available, combining a 2.5L four-cylinder engine with electric motors. Owners generally appreciate the Highlander's smooth ride, fuel efficiency (especially the hybrid), and comprehensive safety features. Common dislikes often revolve around the infotainment system's interface, smaller third-row space compared to some competitors, and relatively bland styling.
