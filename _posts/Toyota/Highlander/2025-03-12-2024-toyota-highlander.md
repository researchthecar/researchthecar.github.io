The 2024 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. The standard engine is a 2.4L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 265 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. A hybrid powertrain is also available, combining a 2.5L four-cylinder engine with electric motors for a total system output of 243 horsepower. Both powertrains are generally well-regarded. Owners often praise the Highlander for its fuel efficiency, safety features, and resale value. However, some common complaints include the smaller cargo space compared to competitors and the sometimes uninspiring driving experience with the base engine.

**Engine**

**2.4L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 2.4L turbo engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil level warning light illuminating, noticeable blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: In some cases, dealers have performed oil consumption tests to assess the severity of the issue. If consumption exceeds Toyota's acceptable threshold, potential solutions could involve replacing the piston rings or, in more severe cases, the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Due to the complexity of this issue and the potential for extensive repairs, the cost can range from $2,000 to $8,000+ depending on the specific repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger on the 2.4L engine can fail prematurely. Symptoms include a significant loss of power, unusual whistling or whining noises from the engine bay, and the check engine light illuminating.
    * Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Four-Cylinder Hybrid**
* **Inverter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the hybrid inverter failing. This manifests as a loss of power, the check engine light illuminating, and potentially the vehicle entering a "limp" mode.
    * Solution: Replacement of the hybrid inverter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (2.4L Turbo)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A software update or transmission control module (TCM) reprogramming is the most common fix. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush may be recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for software updates and fluid flushes, but potentially much higher if physical repairs within the transmission are necessary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Hybrid Models)**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This may be related to the rear sway bar links or bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn sway bar links or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Entune/Infotainment System Freezing or Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can be prone to freezing, crashing, or becoming unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Restarting the system, performing a software update (if available), or, in some cases, replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for a restart, $0 - $200 for software updates (if dealer-installed), and $500 - $2,000+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with various sensors, such as the blind spot monitoring system, parking sensors, or tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS). This can result in false warnings or system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, depending on the type and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may intermittently fail to open or close properly, or it may stop mid-cycle. This could be related to a faulty motor, sensor, or control module.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of the liftgate motor, sensor, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard or Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattling noises from the dashboard or interior trim, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating and securing the source of the rattle, which may involve adding padding or tightening loose fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: This can range from a DIY fix to $100-$300+ if a mechanic needs to locate and address the rattle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Toyota Highlander generally exhibits good reliability, but some owners have reported issues with the 2.4L turbocharged engine such as excessive oil consumption and turbo failure. Owners have reported that the 2.5L hybrid engine can have inverter issues. Other reported issues include harsh transmission shifting (8-speed automatic), suspension noises, and infotainment system problems. The severity of these issues varies, but some, like engine or inverter repairs, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider extended warranties for additional peace of mind.
