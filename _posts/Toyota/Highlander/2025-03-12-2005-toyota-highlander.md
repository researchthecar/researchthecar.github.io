The 2005 Toyota Highlander is a mid-size SUV known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and available third-row seating. Two engine options were available: a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine producing 160 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 engine producing 230 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Highlander's dependability and smooth driving experience, but some common complaints include issues with the vehicle's age, such as rust, and normal wear and tear that older vehicles experience.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets, leading to low oil levels, burning oil smell, and visible oil spots under the vehicle. Common sources include the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4-cylinder, oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include low oil levels, burning oil smell, and visible oil spots under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Knock Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The knock sensors can fail, causing the engine to run poorly, reduce fuel economy, and trigger the check engine light with codes related to knock sensor malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty knock sensors. This often involves removing the intake manifold, increasing the labor cost.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission may exhibit delayed engagement when shifting from Park or Neutral into Drive or Reverse. Harsh shifting between gears can also occur. These issues can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn valve body components, or internal clutch wear.
    *   Solution: Start by checking and potentially changing the transmission fluid. If the problem persists, further diagnosis and repair, such as valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild, may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) to $1,500 - $3,500+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn struts and shocks can result in a bouncy ride, poor handling, increased body roll, and longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ depending on the extent of the work and brand of parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Rust on Lower Control Arms**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust/corrosion on the lower control arms can weaken the suspension, leading to cracking or failure.
    *   Solution: The control arms will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks may fail to operate correctly, either not locking/unlocking or making unusual noises. This is often due to a failing door lock actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Clock Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clock spring, located in the steering wheel, can fail, leading to issues with the horn, airbag warning light, and steering wheel controls.
    *   Solution: Replace the clock spring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the undercarriage, especially in areas where salt is used on roads. This can affect the structural integrity of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Treat and prevent rust with rust inhibitors and coatings. Severely rusted components may need to be replaced.
