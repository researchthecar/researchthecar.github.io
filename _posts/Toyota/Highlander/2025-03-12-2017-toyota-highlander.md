The 2017 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It offers three engine options: a 2.5L 4-cylinder, a 3.5L V6 (295 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque), and a hybrid powertrain based on the 3.5L V6. The V6 is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 4-cylinder uses a 6-speed automatic. People generally like the Highlander's smooth ride, ample cargo space, and strong resale value. Common dislikes include a less engaging driving experience compared to some competitors and a somewhat bland interior design.
