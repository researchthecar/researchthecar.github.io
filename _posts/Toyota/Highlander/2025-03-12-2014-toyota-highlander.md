The 2014 Toyota Highlander is a mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.7L inline-4 producing 185 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 generating 270 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. A major selling point is its reputation for longevity and low running costs. However, some owners have reported issues with specific components, and these can vary with trim level and engine choice. Common complaints include issues with interior electronics and some drivetrain components.
