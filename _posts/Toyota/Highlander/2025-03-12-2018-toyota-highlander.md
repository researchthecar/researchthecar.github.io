The 2018 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.7L inline-4 producing 185 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.5L V6 generating 295 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque. The V6 engine was paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the inline-4 was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Highlander's practicality, safety features, and reputation for longevity. Common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired styling and the less-than-thrilling driving experience compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The most common complaints revolve around the 8-speed transmission paired with the V6 engine, which can experience harsh shifting. Electrical issues with the Entune system and automatic liftgate malfunctions are also reported. Water pump leaks can occur on the V6, while rear suspension sag may be noticed by owners who frequently load the vehicle. These issues range in severity and cost, from relatively minor software updates to more expensive component replacements like the transmission or dashboard. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2018 Highlander.
