The 2016 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It was offered with three engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 185 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L V6 producing 270 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid version using a 3.5L V6 paired with an electric motor. The 2.5L inline-4 was only available on the base LE trim and was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 3.5L V6 was available on all other trims and was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Highlander's dependability, smooth ride, and family-friendly features. Common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's dated interface, the 2.5L engine's lack of power, and some isolated mechanical issues. The 3.5L V6 engine is the most popular option.

The most concerning of these issues would be engine water pump leaks, which could lead to expensive repairs if not addressed promptly. Transmission issues like the torque converter shudder, electrical issues such as battery drains, and suspension sagging are also common issues. The dashboard cracking is a common cosmetic issue that can be costly to fix. Overall, while the Highlander has a good reputation, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
