The 2001 Toyota Highlander marked Toyota's entry into the mid-size SUV market. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine producing 155 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.0L V6 engine rated at 220 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Highlander for its reliability, comfortable ride, and car-like handling. Common complaints include dated styling and the smaller size compared to newer SUVs.

**Summary**

The 2001 Toyota Highlander is generally a reliable vehicle, but as with any older car, it's prone to certain issues. Engine-related oil leaks and timing belt issues are common, and transmission problems like delayed shifting can also occur. Suspension wear and electrical component failures are other potential concerns. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely. Addressing these problems promptly can help extend the life of the vehicle and prevent more costly repairs down the road.
