The 2017 Toyota Prius Prime is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) offering enhanced electric-only driving range compared to the standard Prius. The Prius Prime is equipped with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired with two electric motors, producing a combined 121 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered to the wheels via a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Prime for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and advanced safety features. Common criticisms include the limited rear passenger headroom due to the battery placement, and the relatively small cargo area.

**Summary**

The 2017 Toyota Prius Prime is a reliable and fuel-efficient plug-in hybrid vehicle, but owners have reported some issues. The most common problems relate to electrical components (infotainment system and 12V battery), interior (dashboard cracking and display delamination), and potential reductions in EV range over time. While some of these issues can be addressed with software updates or relatively inexpensive repairs, others, such as replacing the hybrid battery or dashboard, can be more costly. Overall, the severity of these issues varies, and potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems when considering a used 2017 Prius Prime.
