The 2019 Toyota Prius Prime is a plug-in hybrid vehicle praised for its exceptional fuel economy and comfortable ride. It utilizes a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 121 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque, driven by a CVT transmission. Owners appreciate the Prius Prime for its quiet operation in electric mode and its ability to travel a significant distance on a single charge. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space compared to the standard Prius and sometimes lackluster acceleration.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**
*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inverter, responsible for converting DC power from the battery to AC power for the electric motor, can fail. Symptoms include a warning light on the dashboard, reduced electric driving range, and potential inability to start the vehicle or run the electric motor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the inverter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+

**Battery**
*   **Reduced EV Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the high-voltage battery pack's capacity may degrade, resulting in a noticeable decrease in the vehicle's all-electric driving range.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the battery pack or individual modules may be necessary. In some cases, rebalancing the battery cells can improve performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**
*   **Hesitation/Jerking during Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly when transitioning between electric and gasoline power. This can be caused by the complex interplay between the electric motor, gasoline engine, and CVT.
    *   Solution: A software update to the hybrid control system or CVT calibration may be required. In some cases, replacement of the CVT may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $5,000+ (CVT replacement)

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve the issue. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (infotainment unit replacement)

*   **Headlight Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlights may flicker, dim, or fail completely. This can be due to faulty bulbs, wiring issues, or a malfunctioning headlight control module.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the bulbs, wiring repair, or replacement of the headlight control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $500+

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks in Tail Light Assembly**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water can accumulate within the tail light housings, potentially leading to condensation, bulb failure, or electrical damage. This is caused by a poorly sealed tail light assembly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the tail light assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System - Weak Airflow**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported weak airflow from the HVAC system, especially when using the air conditioning. This can be caused by a clogged cabin air filter, a malfunctioning blower motor, or issues with the blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cabin air filter, blower motor, or blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $500+

**Summary**
The 2019 Toyota Prius Prime generally proves to be a reliable vehicle. The most severe and costly issues reported are related to the high-voltage battery and inverter, but this is not a common occurrence. Other common issues include electrical glitches and minor mechanical issues. Potential buyers should be aware of the possibility of these issues and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
