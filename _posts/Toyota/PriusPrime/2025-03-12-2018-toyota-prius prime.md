The 2018 Toyota Prius Prime is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) offering increased electric-only range compared to the standard Prius hybrid. It features a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 121 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is standard. Owners often praise the Prius Prime for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. Common criticisms include its limited rear cargo space, somewhat uninspiring driving dynamics, and some find the infotainment system dated.
