**Engine**

**1.5L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Running**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may experience intermittent misfires, leading to a rough idle, hesitation during acceleration, and a noticeable decrease in fuel economy. This can be caused by faulty ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with an OBD-II scanner to identify the affected cylinder(s). Replacement of the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, decreased fuel efficiency, and potential catalytic converter damage if left unaddressed. Faulty or degraded oxygen sensors can cause these symptoms.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor (either upstream or downstream).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, particularly when shifting between lower gears. This can be caused by degraded transmission fluid or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and replacement. If the issue persists, further diagnosis of the valve body may be required, and potentially a valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises emanating from the suspension while driving over bumps, indicating worn bushings, ball joints, or tie rod ends.
    * Solution: Inspection of suspension components and replacement of worn parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially if left unused for a few days. This could be due to an internal parasitic draw from a component not shutting down properly.
    * Solution: Locate the source of the parasitic draw through testing, then repair or replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The touchscreen responds slowly, freezes, or exhibits other glitches. This can be due to software or hardware problems within the head unit.
    * Solution: Restarting the infotainment system, updating the software, or, in some cases, replacing the entire head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $800+

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the headlight assembly.
    * Solution: Removing the headlight assembly, drying it out thoroughly, and resealing it to prevent moisture intrusion. In severe cases, the headlight assembly may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Use of dashboard protectants to minimize UV damage. Repair or replacement of the dashboard in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1000+

**Recalls**

*   **None Found**

**Summary**

The 2018 Toyota Yaris R, a rebadged Mazda2, generally experiences relatively minor issues, which is characteristic of Toyota's reputation for reliability. However, issues like engine misfires, harsh transmission shifting, premature suspension wear, and electrical gremlins can occur. The severity of these issues ranges from simple fixes like replacing an oxygen sensor to more costly repairs such as replacing a valve body or the entire infotainment system. Overall, while some issues can be inconvenient and potentially costly, the 2018 Yaris R remains a relatively reliable and fuel-efficient option.
