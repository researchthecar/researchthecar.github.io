It is only available with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many people appreciate the Yaris R for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some dislike its relatively small size, limited rear seat space, and somewhat basic interior.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil more often than expected.
    *   Solution: The cause of excessive oil consumption can vary. A diagnostic inspection by a qualified mechanic is needed to determine the root cause. Potential solutions could include replacing valve seals, piston rings, or addressing cylinder wall issues. In some cases, a different oil viscosity might help mitigate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dependent on the cause. Replacing valve seals or piston rings can range from $1,000 - $3,000+. A new engine can cost $4,000 - $6,000+.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed occasional harsh shifting or jerking during gear changes, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like a noticeable "bump" or hesitation between gears.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or dirty, a fluid flush and filter replacement may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a more in-depth inspection of the transmission valve body may be necessary, as it could be a valve body issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement: $150 - $300. Valve body replacement: $800 - $1,500+. Complete transmission rebuild or replacement: $2,500 - $5,000+.
