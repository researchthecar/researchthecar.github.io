The 2016 Toyota Yaris R is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and reliability. However, the Yaris R is actually a rebadged Mazda2 that was sold exclusively in the Mexican market. It features a 1.5-liter inline-4 engine producing around 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its nimble handling and fuel economy but sometimes criticize its relatively small size and basic interior features.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the need to add a quart of oil every 1,000-3,000 miles, accompanied by a burning oil smell in some cases.
    *   Solution: The recommended solution is an engine inspection to determine the source of the oil consumption. This may involve replacing piston rings or valve seals, depending on the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. The shifts can be especially noticeable between first and second gear, or during downshifts.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush/update); $800 - $3,000 (valve body/rebuild)
