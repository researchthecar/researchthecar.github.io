The 2009 Toyota Rush is a compact SUV known for its practicality and off-road capabilities, especially in certain markets. It offers a blend of car-like handling and SUV functionality. Commonly liked for its reliability and compact size making it easy to maneuver in urban settings, some drivers find the Rush's engine underpowered for highway driving and fully loaded conditions. The 2009 Toyota Rush was primarily available with a 1.5L 3SZ-VE inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 109 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**1.5L 3SZ-VE**
*   **Valve Train Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the top of the engine, especially noticeable at idle or during cold starts. This can be due to worn valve lifters or insufficient lubrication to the valve train.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve lifters or adjusting the valve clearances. In some cases, using a higher-viscosity oil can temporarily reduce the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, stalling, or fluctuating RPMs at idle. This can be caused by a dirty or malfunctioning IAC valve.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the IAC valve with a throttle body cleaner. If cleaning doesn't resolve the issue, replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**
*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay in shifting between gears, or harsh/jerky shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, low transmission fluid, or a malfunctioning valve body.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. In severe cases, a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $200+ for fluid flush; $500 - $1500+ for valve body repair/replacement; $2000 - $4000+ for rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**
*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty engaging certain gears, particularly 1st or reverse. This can be due to worn synchronizers, a damaged clutch disc, or a misadjusted shift linkage.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the shift linkage. Replacing the clutch disc and pressure plate. Rebuilding the transmission to replace worn synchronizers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100+ for shift linkage adjustment; $400 - $1200+ for clutch replacement; $1000 - $2500+ for transmission rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and wandering steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent operation of power windows, or windows failing to go up or down. This can be caused by a faulty power window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Central locking system failing to lock or unlock doors, or inconsistent operation. This could be due to a faulty door lock actuator, wiring issue, or a malfunctioning central locking module.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the root cause, which includes testing the actuators, checking wiring connections, or replacing the central locking module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Prone**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, especially in areas with high humidity or road salt use. Common areas include the undercarriage, wheel wells, and around body seams.
    *   Solution: Addressing rust with rust converters, fillers, and repainting. Prevention includes regular washing and waxing, and rustproofing treatments.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air from the air conditioning system. This can be due to a refrigerant leak, a failing compressor, or a clogged evaporator core.
    *   Solution: Recharge the refrigerant. Repair the leak. Replace the compressor or evaporator core.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ for recharge; $300 - $1200+ for compressor replacement; $500 - $1500+ for evaporator core replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Toyota Rush, while generally reliable, does exhibit some common issues. Engine and transmission problems can range from minor valve train noises to more significant shifting problems, with repair costs varying accordingly. Suspension and electrical issues are also present, potentially impacting the driving experience. While some issues like worn bushings may be minor, problems with the transmission or air conditioning can be more costly to resolve. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected before purchase.
