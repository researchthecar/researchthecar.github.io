The 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander is a mid-size SUV offering three powertrain options: a 2.4L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 265 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5L four-cylinder hybrid engine producing 245 horsepower, and a Hybrid MAX 2.4L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 362 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. The turbocharged engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid engines use a CVT. The Grand Highlander is praised for its spacious third row, comfortable ride, and ample cargo space. Some criticisms include the infotainment system's complexity and occasional wind noise at highway speeds.

**Summary**

The 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander appears to be a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues. Engine issues seem to be rare, but can be costly to fix. CVT issues are common and the solution is to update the software for the TCM. Interior and exterior issues can be frustrating but are often minor. Most of the issues should be covered under the manufacturer's warranty during the initial ownership period. As the vehicle is relatively new, additional long-term reliability data is still emerging.
