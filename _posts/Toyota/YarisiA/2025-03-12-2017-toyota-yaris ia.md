The 2017 Toyota Yaris iA, later rebranded as the Toyota Yaris in subsequent years, is a subcompact sedan offering practicality and fuel efficiency. It was originally designed and manufactured by Mazda, sharing its underpinnings with the Mazda2. The 2017 Yaris iA comes with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its nimble handling, fuel economy, and standard features. Common dislikes include its somewhat cramped rear seats and limited cargo space.

**Summary**

The 2017 Toyota Yaris iA is generally a reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with excessive oil consumption, harsh shifting in the automatic transmission, infotainment system glitches, and interior rattling noises. The severity and cost of these issues vary. Oil consumption and transmission issues can be more costly to address if they require extensive internal repairs. Interior rattles are typically less severe but can be annoying. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect any used Yaris iA before purchasing.
