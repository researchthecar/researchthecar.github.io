The 2019 Toyota Prius AWD-e is a fuel-efficient hybrid vehicle that combines a 1.8L four-cylinder engine with an electric motor to provide all-wheel drive capability. The engine produces 96 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque, while the electric motor contributes to the overall system output. While appreciated for its exceptional fuel economy (estimated 50+ MPG), many owners find the acceleration and overall driving experience to be underwhelming. Some also find the interior materials to be basic and uninspired. The other engine option is the front wheel drive version of the 1.8L four-cylinder engine which has its own sets of unique issues as well.

**Electric Motor**

**Battery**

**1.8L Four-Cylinder Hybrid AWD-e**

* **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time, the hybrid battery can degrade, leading to reduced fuel economy, decreased electric-only range, and diminished overall performance. Warning lights related to the hybrid system may illuminate.
    * Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack or individual modules.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ECVT (Electronic Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **Transmission Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission failure, indicated by a check engine light, slipping, or complete loss of power, is extremely rare but can occur, especially at higher mileages.
    * Solution: Transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Inverter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The inverter, which converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the electric motor, can fail. Symptoms include a loss of power, warning lights, and potential inability to start the vehicle.
    * Solution: Inverter replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **12V Battery Drain**

**Summary**

The 2019 Toyota Prius AWD-e generally experiences fewer major mechanical issues compared to some other vehicles. However, potential problems such as AWD motor failure, hybrid battery degradation, and inverter issues can be expensive to repair. Electrical gremlins and infotainment system glitches can also be frustrating. Overall, the severity of potential issues ranges from minor inconveniences to costly repairs, with estimated costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the problem.
