**Introduction:**

The 2020 Toyota Prius AWD-e is a hybrid vehicle that combines a 1.8L 4-cylinder gasoline engine with two electric motors. The engine delivers 96 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque, while the electric motors provide additional power and all-wheel drive capability. The Prius AWD-e is known for its fuel efficiency and spacious interior, but it has also been plagued by some issues.

**Engine**

**1.8L 4-Cylinder Gasoline Engine**

* **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption can occur due to issues with the piston rings or valve seals. Symptoms include low oil levels, smoke from the exhaust, and reduced engine performance. Solution involves replacing the affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Water Pump Failure:** The water pump may fail prematurely, leading to overheating and engine damage. Symptoms include coolant leaks, overheating, and warning lights on the dashboard. Solution involves replacing the water pump and affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
* **Emission System Issues:** Faulty oxygen sensors or catalytic converters can cause emission problems and reduce fuel efficiency. Symptoms include check engine lights, poor acceleration, and increased emissions. Solution involves replacing the affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
* **Timing Chain Rattle:** The timing chain may rattle due to excessive wear or tensioner failure. Symptoms include a rattling sound from the engine, especially during acceleration. Solution involves replacing the timing chain and components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Transmission**

**CVT (Electrically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **Shuddering or Jerking:** The CVT may experience shuddering or jerking during shifts, especially in low speeds or when the vehicle is under load. Solution involves reprogramming the transmission control module or replacing the affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
* **Slipping or Hesitation:** The transmission may slip or hesitate during acceleration or gear changes, causing poor performance and reduced fuel efficiency. Solution involves replacing the transmission fluid, solenoids, or other affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
* **Transmission Failure:** The CVT may fail completely, leading to loss of power and mobility. Symptoms include no movement or abnormal noises from the transmission. Solution involves replacing the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+

**Suspension**

* **Strut Failure:** The front or rear struts may fail due to excessive wear or impact damage. Symptoms include poor handling, uneven tire wear, and clunking noises from the suspension. Solution involves replacing the affected struts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+ per strut
* **Coil Spring Breakage:** The coil springs can break, affecting the ride height and handling. Symptoms include a sagging or uneven stance, reduced cornering ability, and abnormal noises from the suspension. Solution involves replacing the broken coil springs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per coil spring

**Electrical**

* **Battery Failure:** The 12-volt battery may fail prematurely, leading to electrical problems and difficulty starting the vehicle. Symptoms include a dead or weak battery, dimming lights, and warning lights on the dashboard. Solution involves replacing the battery. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
* **Electrical Harness Issues:** Electrical harnesses may develop shorts or faults, causing various electrical problems. Symptoms can include intermittent power loss, malfunctioning components, and warning lights on the dashboard. Solution involves diagnosing and repairing the affected electrical harnesses. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the issue
* **Headlight Malfunction:** The headlights may malfunction, reducing visibility and posing safety concerns. Symptoms can include dim or flickering headlights, or complete failure of the headlights. Solution involves replacing the affected bulbs or components. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the issue

**Exterior**

* **Door Lock Malfunction:** The door locks may malfunction, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking. Symptoms include inoperative door locks, difficulty accessing the vehicle, and warning lights on the dashboard. Solution involves replacing the affected door lock actuators or components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per door

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Rattling:** The dashboard may rattle or make noises due to loose components or vibration. Symptoms include annoying rattling sounds while driving. Solution involves identifying and tightening the loose components or applying padding to reduce vibration. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
* **Seat Recliner Malfunction:** The seat recliners may malfunction, preventing the seats from reclining or adjusting properly. Symptoms include stuck or inoperable seat recliners. Solution involves replacing the affected components or repairing the seat tracks. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per seat

**Summary:**

The 2020 Toyota Prius AWD-e has been plagued by several issues in various components, including the engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, exterior, and interior.
