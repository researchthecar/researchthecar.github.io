The 2021 Toyota Prius AWD-e is a fuel-efficient hybrid vehicle known for its practicality and reliability. It features a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, delivering a combined 121 horsepower. The standard Prius is front-wheel drive, while the AWD-e model adds an additional electric motor to power the rear wheels on demand, improving traction in slippery conditions. Common praises for the Prius include its exceptional fuel economy, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Criticisms often focus on its somewhat uninspiring driving dynamics and polarizing styling. The standard (non AWD-e) Prius is also available with the same 1.8L hybrid engine, but without the rear electric motor and AWD system.

**Electric Motor**

**AWD-e Electric Motor**

*   **Rear Electric Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear electric motor, responsible for providing all-wheel drive, may fail prematurely. Symptoms include a warning light on the dashboard indicating an AWD system malfunction, a loss of AWD functionality, and potential noises from the rear of the vehicle. This seems to be more prevalent in colder climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear electric motor assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the hybrid battery's capacity can degrade, resulting in reduced fuel economy, shorter all-electric driving range, and potentially a warning light indicating a battery issue.
    *   Solution: Battery reconditioning or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature failure and leaking of the rear shock absorbers. Can cause poor handling, a bouncy ride, and clunking noises from the rear suspension.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery can drain prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly or if accessories are left on. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery. Addressing parasitic draws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software update or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1,000+ (for unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard material, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2021 Toyota Prius AWD-e generally maintains a good reputation for reliability, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as rear electric motor failure, hybrid battery degradation, and electrical problems. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like replacing the rear electric motor or hybrid battery, can be costly.
