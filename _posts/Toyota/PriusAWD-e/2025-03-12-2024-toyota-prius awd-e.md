The 2024 Toyota Prius AWD-e is a hybrid vehicle known for its excellent fuel economy and added all-wheel drive capability. The AWD-e model uses a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor to provide a combined 196 horsepower. Other Prius models are available with front-wheel drive only. Many owners appreciate the Prius for its fuel efficiency and reliability, while common criticisms include its somewhat polarizing styling and occasionally sluggish acceleration (though the 2023+ models address this somewhat). This document focuses on common problems specific to the 2024 AWD-e model.

**Electric Motor**

**1.8L 4-Cylinder Hybrid w/ AWD-e**

*   **Reduced AWD Operation in Cold Weather**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the AWD system becoming less effective or disengaging entirely in very cold temperatures. This is due to the rear electric motor's performance being limited to protect it from extreme cold.
    *   Solution: There is no direct fix, as this is a design feature. Toyota may release software updates in the future to improve performance, but currently, the only solution is to drive in a way that accommodates the reduced AWD capability in very cold weather.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Stiff Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners find the suspension on the 2024 Prius AWD-e to be stiffer than previous generations, leading to a less comfortable ride, particularly over rough road surfaces. The AWD system may contribute to this as the suspension components are more robust.
    *   Solution: Aftermarket suspension components, such as softer springs or adjustable dampers, could improve ride quality. However, this may affect handling and void part of the warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of the infotainment system freezing, glitching, or failing to respond to touch inputs. This includes issues with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.
    *   Solution: First, try resetting the infotainment system by holding down the power button. If the problem persists, a software update from Toyota may be required. In more severe cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,500+ (Head Unit Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alarms or complete failure of the blind spot monitoring system and/or parking sensors. This can be intermittent or persistent.
    *   Solution: Check the sensors for dirt or obstructions. If the issue continues, the sensors may need recalibration or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor (replacement/recalibration)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Wind Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive wind noise around the windshield or door seals at highway speeds.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust door seals. In some cases, the windshield may need to be resealed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels while driving, especially on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and applying felt tape or foam padding to secure loose components. Dealership technicians may be able to assist in locating and fixing the source of the rattle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (depending on complexity and shop rates)
    * Recalls: None Found
