The 2004 Toyota Echo is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and affordability. It came standard with a 1.5L 4-cylinder engine (1NZ-FE) producing 108 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate its simple design, ease of parking, and low running costs. Common complaints include its basic interior, limited features, and susceptibility to crosswinds due to its lightweight nature.

**Engine**

**1.5L 1NZ-FE**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the 1NZ-FE engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs. This can be indicated by blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels on the dipstick.
    * Solution: The repair can vary depending on the cause of the oil consumption. Potential solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or the entire engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Check Engine Light Due to EVAP System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates and a diagnostic scan reveals codes related to the evaporative emission control system (EVAP). This can be caused by a faulty gas cap, a leak in the EVAP hoses, or a malfunctioning purge valve.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the specific EVAP system component causing the issue. This might involve replacing the gas cap, hoses, purge valve, or charcoal canister.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or delayed shifting, particularly between gears. This can be caused by worn-out transmission fluid, a faulty shift solenoid, or internal transmission damage.
    * Solution: Begin with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnosis and repair may be needed, potentially involving replacing shift solenoids or rebuilding the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The ride quality deteriorates, with excessive bouncing, swaying, or nose-diving during braking. There may also be noises like clunking or rattling coming from the suspension.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and/or shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Dim Headlights**
    * Description/Symptoms: Headlights appear dimmer than usual, potentially affecting visibility at night. This can be caused by corroded connections, a failing alternator, or aging headlight bulbs.
    * Solution: Check and clean all electrical connections related to the headlights. Replace headlight bulbs, test the alternator, and consider upgrading to newer headlight technology if the issue persists.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power windows stop working or operate slowly. The window motor may be making unusual noises or not responding at all.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can form in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure. This can be seen on the undercarriage, around wheel wells, and along body panels.
    * Solution: Rust repair or replacement of affected body panels.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: The dashboard develops cracks, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Toyota Echo generally enjoys a reputation for reliability. The most common issues involve the engine (oil consumption, EVAP system), automatic transmission (harsh shifting), suspension (worn struts/shocks), electrical system (dim headlights, power window motor failure), and some rust. The severity of these issues varies, with potential repair costs ranging from relatively minor (e.g., replacing a gas cap) to more substantial (e.g., engine rebuild). However, most repairs are relatively inexpensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and inspect the vehicle carefully before purchase.
