It came equipped with a 1.5L 4-cylinder engine (1NZ-FE) producing 108 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. The Echo was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Echo's affordability, ease of parking, and low running costs. Some common complaints include its basic interior, limited cargo space, and somewhat underwhelming performance.

**Engine**

**1.5L 1NZ-FE**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, especially as the vehicle ages. This can manifest as the need to add oil between changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, or low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is severe, a compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the cause. Potential fixes range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oxygen sensors (especially the upstream sensor) can fail, leading to poor fuel economy, a check engine light (often with codes P0171, P0130, P0133), and rough idling.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Catalytic converter failure can trigger a check engine light (often code P0420), reduced engine performance, and a sulfur-like smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the brand and availability)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report delayed or harsh shifting, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear. This can worsen as the transmission fluid degrades.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, valve body issues may require further inspection and repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 (fluid flush); $500 - $1500+ (valve body repair or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: As with many older vehicles, the struts and shocks can wear out, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (depending on parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken or Sagging Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The springs can sag or break, leading to a lower ride height, uneven tire wear, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken or sagging springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 (depending on parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Light Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the bulbs in the instrument cluster can burn out, making it difficult to see the gauges at night.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100 (depending on if you do it yourself or have a mechanic do it)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can be a concern, especially in areas with harsh winters and road salt. Common areas for rust include the wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. Apply rust inhibitors to prevent further corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
