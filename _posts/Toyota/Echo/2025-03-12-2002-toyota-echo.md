Transmission problems, especially with the automatic transmission, can be more costly. Suspension issues are typical for a car of this age, and electrical problems can also occur. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. The overall cost and severity of these issues range from minor maintenance to potentially expensive repairs, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing.
