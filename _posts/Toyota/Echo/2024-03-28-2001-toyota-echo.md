**Introduction:**

The 2001 Toyota Echo is a compact car known for its fuel efficiency and reliability. It is available with two engine options: a 1.3-liter inline-four producing 88 horsepower and 93 lb-ft of torque and a 1.5-liter inline-four generating 108 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque. Both engines come mated to a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.

Drivers appreciate the Echo's low operating costs, spacious interior for its size, and agile handling, while some find the interior to be basic and the performance to be lacking.
