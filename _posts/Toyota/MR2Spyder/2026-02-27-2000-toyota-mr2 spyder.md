### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Toyota MR2 Spyder is generally a reliable vehicle, benefiting from Toyota's robust engineering. The 1.8L 1ZZ-FE engine is known for its durability, though owners should be mindful of potential oil consumption and leaks, requiring regular checks. The manual transmission is typically trouble-free. However, the optional 6-speed Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT) has been a notable weak point, with common issues involving the clutch actuator and hydraulic pump, which can be costly to repair. Electrical components like power window motors and instrument clusters can also develop faults over time. The soft top may require attention for leaks. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of potential SMT issues, the MR2 Spyder remains a rewarding and relatively dependable sports car.
