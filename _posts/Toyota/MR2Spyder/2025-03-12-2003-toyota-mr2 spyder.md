The 2003 Toyota MR2 Spyder is a lightweight, two-seat, mid-engine sports car known for its nimble handling and engaging driving experience. It came exclusively with a 1.8-liter 1ZZ-FED four-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed sequential manual transmission (SMT). Owners generally appreciate the MR2 Spyder for its unique mid-engine layout, affordability, and fun factor. Common complaints revolve around limited storage space, a somewhat unrefined engine, and age-related maintenance issues.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FED**

* **Pre-Cat Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converters (pre-cats) located in the exhaust manifold can disintegrate over time. Debris can then be sucked back into the engine, scoring the cylinder walls and causing excessive oil consumption and eventual engine failure. Symptoms include increased oil consumption, rough running, and a rattling sound from the exhaust manifold.
    * Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold with an aftermarket header that eliminates the pre-cats, or replace the manifold with an updated OEM part. Regularly check and monitor oil levels. If engine damage has already occurred, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can be a problem. Often related to pre-cat failure but can occur independently in older engines due to worn piston rings or valve seals. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently, blue smoke from the exhaust, and fouled spark plugs.
    * Solution: Regular oil level checks and top-offs can mitigate the issue. If consumption is severe, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary. Switching to a thicker oil may help slow consumption in some cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Ticking**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking sound coming from the engine, especially when cold. This is often caused by worn valve lifters or incorrect valve lash.
    * Solution: Adjust valve lash to the factory specifications. If the ticking persists, the valve lifters may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT)**

* **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The SMT system uses a hydraulic pump to actuate the clutch and shift gears. The pump can fail over time, leading to difficulty shifting, failure to shift, or complete loss of transmission function. Warning lights on the dashboard may illuminate.
    * Solution: Replace the hydraulic pump assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Shift Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting gears. Complete failure to shift.
    * Solution: Repair the shifter mechanism.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Sagging Springs**
    * Description/Symptoms: The factory springs can sag over time, leading to a reduced ride height and compromised handling.
    * Solution: Replace the springs with new OEM or aftermarket springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: The suspension bushings (especially the rear trailing arm bushings) can wear out, causing sloppy handling, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace the worn bushings with new OEM or aftermarket polyurethane bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Failure of the oxygen sensors (O2 sensors) can cause poor fuel economy, rough running, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, resulting in a dead battery, dimming headlights, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Soft Top Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The soft top material can crack, tear, or shrink over time, especially in harsh climates. The plastic rear window can become cloudy or cracked.
    * Solution: Replace the soft top with a new OEM or aftermarket top. Replacing the plastic window is also an option.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Side Vent Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The plastic side vents located behind the doors can crack or become brittle due to sun exposure.
    * Solution: Replace the side vents with new OEM or aftermarket vents.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Center Console Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The plastic center console can crack, particularly around the radio and climate control vents.
    * Solution: Replace the center console.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Glove Box Latch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The glove box latch can break, causing the glove box to hang open.
    * Solution: Replace the glove box latch or the entire glove box assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $150+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Toyota MR2 Spyder, while a fun and engaging sports car, can suffer from several age-related issues. The most significant concern is the potential for pre-cat failure leading to engine damage. Other common problems include oil consumption, suspension wear, and issues with the SMT system (if equipped). The severity and cost of these issues can vary greatly depending on the car's maintenance history and overall condition. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, engine-related problems or SMT repairs can be costly. Buyers should thoroughly inspect any potential MR2 Spyder and be aware of these potential issues.
