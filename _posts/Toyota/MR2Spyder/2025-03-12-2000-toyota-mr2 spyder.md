The 2000 Toyota MR2 Spyder is a fun, lightweight, mid-engine roadster. It was only offered with one engine: a 1.8L 1ZZ-FE inline-4 producing 138 hp and 125 lb-ft of torque. It was originally offered with a 5-speed manual transmission, and later a 5-speed sequential manual transmission (SMT) was offered. Owners appreciate its nimble handling, sporty feel, and simple design. Common complaints revolve around the lack of storage space, engine issues related to oil starvation, and some uncomfortable interior elements.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FE**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 1ZZ-FE engine is prone to excessive oil consumption, especially in earlier model years. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell. This issue stems from the piston ring design which can clog and cause oil to leak into the combustion chamber.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to replace the pistons and piston rings with an updated design that addresses the oil consumption issue. Some owners may also need to replace valve stem seals if they are worn. Some owners may opt for an engine swap, or rebuild with aftermarket parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Pre-cat Failure and Engine Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter (pre-cat) located in the exhaust manifold can disintegrate over time. The debris can then be sucked back into the engine, causing damage to the cylinder walls and piston rings. Symptoms may include a rattling noise from the exhaust manifold, reduced engine performance, and increased oil consumption.
    *   Solution: The best solution is to replace the exhaust manifold with an aftermarket header that eliminates the pre-cat. Replacing the engine is also a solution, but much more expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (header replacement), $2,000 - $4,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the valve cover gasket can harden and leak, causing oil to drip onto the exhaust manifold. This can result in a burning oil smell and potential fire hazard.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Worn Synchros**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with worn synchros, particularly in 2nd and 3rd gear. Symptoms include grinding or difficulty shifting into those gears.
    *   Solution: Rebuild the transmission with new synchros or replace the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT)**

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMT system relies on a hydraulic pump to operate the clutch and shift gears. This pump can fail over time, leading to shifting problems, difficulty starting the car, or complete failure of the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Accumulator Leak/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The accumulator stores hydraulic pressure for the SMT system. Leaks or failures in the accumulator can cause shifting problems, longer shift times, and eventually complete loss of shifting ability.
    *   Solution: Replace the accumulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Actuator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The shift actuator controls the movement of the shift forks within the SMT. Problems can arise due to wear, electrical faults, or hydraulic issues within the actuator, causing the car to become stuck in gear or unable to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the shift actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The suspension bushings, especially in the front control arms, can wear out over time. This can lead to loose handling, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings with new ones or upgrade to polyurethane bushings for improved durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time, the struts and shocks can lose their damping ability, resulting in a bouncy ride and reduced handling performance.
    * Solution: Replace the struts and shocks with new ones. Consider upgrading to aftermarket performance dampers for improved handling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensors can fail over time, leading to poor fuel economy, rough running, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, resulting in a dead battery, dimming lights, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the instrument cluster, such as gauges not working or flickering lights.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft top can be prone to leaks, tears, and difficulty latching. The plastic rear window can become cloudy or cracked over time.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the soft top. Consider replacing the plastic window with a glass one for improved visibility and durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Antenna Mast Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: The antenna mast is prone to breakage, particularly if it is not lubricated regularly.
    * Solution: Replace the antenna mast or the entire antenna assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Driver's Seat Rocking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The driver's seat can develop a rocking motion due to wear in the seat frame or mounting points.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the seat frame or mounting points.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Center Console Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The center console plastic can be brittle and prone to cracking, especially around the gear shifter.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the center console.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Handle Cable/Mechanism Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cable or mechanism that operates the door handle can break, preventing the door from opening from the inside or outside.
    *   Solution: Replace the door handle cable or the entire door handle assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Toyota MR2 Spyder is a fun and engaging sports car, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The most concerning problem is the 1ZZ-FE engine's tendency for excessive oil consumption and potential pre-cat failure. These issues can lead to costly repairs, including engine replacement. The SMT transmission also has its own set of problems which also could lead to expensive repairs. Other issues, such as soft top wear and electrical problems, are less severe but should still be considered when evaluating a potential purchase. Overall, the MR2 Spyder can be a reliable and enjoyable car with proper maintenance and attention to these common issues.
