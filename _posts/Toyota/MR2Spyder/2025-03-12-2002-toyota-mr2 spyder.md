The 2002 Toyota MR2 Spyder is a small, lightweight, and fun-to-drive roadster. It came equipped with only one engine option: the 1.8L 1ZZ-FE inline-4 engine producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. The transmission choices included a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed sequential manual transmission (SMT). Owners appreciate the MR2 Spyder for its nimble handling, mid-engine layout, and simple design. Common complaints often involve the lack of storage space and the somewhat underpowered engine.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FE**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 1ZZ-FE engine, particularly in earlier model years (including 2002), is known for excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between changes, blue-ish smoke from the exhaust (especially on startup or acceleration), and low oil level warnings. This is often due to piston ring issues.
    *   Solution: The most effective solution is to replace the pistons and rings with an updated design that addresses the oil consumption issue. Some owners opt for a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on the scope of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Pre-cat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter, located within the exhaust manifold, can fail and disintegrate. The ceramic material can then be sucked back into the engine, causing damage to the cylinder walls and piston rings. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the exhaust manifold, decreased engine performance, and potentially increased oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold with an aftermarket header that eliminates the pre-cat. Some owners replace the entire exhaust system to avoid future problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and chosen replacement parts).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Gear Grinding/Difficulty Shifting into Reverse**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported grinding noises or difficulty engaging reverse gear. This can be due to worn synchronizers or a misaligned/worn shifter linkage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the synchronizers or adjusting/replacing the shifter linkage components. Transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the severity and chosen solution).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT)**

*   **SMT Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMT system uses a hydraulic pump to actuate the clutch and shift gears. The pump can fail, leading to difficulty shifting, inability to shift, or complete transmission failure. Warning lights related to the SMT system will also illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the SMT pump. Ensure the hydraulic fluid is properly bled after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ (including parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SMT Accumulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The accumulator stores hydraulic pressure for the SMT system. If it fails, shifting becomes erratic or impossible.
    *   Solution: Replace the accumulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ (including parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Sagging Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory springs can sag over time, leading to a lower ride height and potentially impacting handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the springs with new OEM or aftermarket springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (including parts and labor for replacing all four springs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensors can fail, leading to poor fuel economy, a check engine light, and potential catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the sensor and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, leading to a dead battery and potential electrical system issues. Symptoms include dimming headlights, a battery warning light, and difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (including parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The convertible soft top can develop tears, leaks, and the plastic rear window can become cloudy or cracked.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the soft top. Aftermarket options offer improved durability and features. Replacing the rear window is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ (depending on the extent of the damage and chosen solution).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2002 Toyota MR2 Spyder is a generally reliable sports car, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with oil consumption in the 1ZZ-FE engine and potential problems with the SMT system if equipped. The cost to address these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls. Addressing the pre-cat issue early can prevent costly engine damage.
