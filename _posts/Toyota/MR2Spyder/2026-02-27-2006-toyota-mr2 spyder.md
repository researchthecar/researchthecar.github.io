### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Toyota MR2 Spyder is a reliable sports car, especially with the manual transmission. The naturally aspirated 1.8L engine is generally robust, though some instances of oil consumption and leaks have been noted. The manual transmission is largely trouble-free. However, the optional Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT) has shown a propensity for issues with its clutch actuator and hydraulic pump, which can be costly to repair. Other areas like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are typically solid, with only minor concerns like convertible top operation occasionally arising. Overall, it's a dependable choice for enthusiasts, particularly if opting for the manual gearbox.
