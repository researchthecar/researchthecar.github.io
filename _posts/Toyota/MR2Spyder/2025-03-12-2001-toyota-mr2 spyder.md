The 2001 Toyota MR2 Spyder is a rear-wheel-drive, mid-engine roadster known for its lightweight design, nimble handling, and affordable price point. It was only offered with a 1.8L 1ZZ-FED four-cylinder engine that produced 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed sequential manual transmission (SMT). Owners often praise the car's engaging driving experience and simple design, while some common complaints include a lack of storage space and a sometimes harsh ride quality.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FED**

*   **Pre-Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter, located in the exhaust manifold, can break down and send debris back into the engine. This can lead to scoring of the cylinder walls and excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include a burning oil smell, blue smoke from the exhaust, and rapidly decreasing oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the entire exhaust manifold with one that does not contain pre-cats is the best solution. Alternatively, the engine can be rebuilt or replaced if damage has already occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 (manifold replacement), $3000+ (engine rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Train Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Lifter tick can occur due to lack of proper lubrication and small oil passages.
    *   Solution: Perform an engine flush and begin using a high-quality oil. If the ticking is persistent, inspect the lifters and valve train components for damage and replace them as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Premature Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The OEM clutch disc is known to be weak.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc with an aftermarket one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT)**

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hydraulic pump that operates the SMT system can fail, leading to difficulty shifting gears or a complete inability to shift. The pump motor can burn out due to age and wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Accumulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The accumulator stores hydraulic pressure for the SMT system. If it fails, shifting performance will degrade and eventually, the transmission may not shift at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the accumulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shift solenoids control the flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate gear changes. Faulty solenoids can cause erratic shifting, missed shifts, or an inability to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty shift solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Sagging Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original springs can sag over time, leading to a lower ride height and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the springs with new OEM or aftermarket springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rubber bushings in the suspension components can wear out, causing play and noise.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensors can fail due to age and exposure to exhaust gases, leading to poor fuel economy and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft top material can crack or tear over time due to sun exposure and wear. The rear plastic window can also become cloudy or brittle.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the soft top. Replacement of the rear plastic window.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic center console can be brittle and prone to cracking, especially around the shifter and cup holders.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the center console.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Toyota MR2 Spyder is generally a reliable car, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the pre-catalytic converter, SMT system (if equipped), and soft top. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but addressing them promptly can help ensure the longevity and enjoyable ownership of this sporty roadster. The potential for engine damage from pre-cat failure is the most serious concern, potentially costing thousands to repair. The SMT system, while offering a unique driving experience, can be a source of expensive repairs as well.
