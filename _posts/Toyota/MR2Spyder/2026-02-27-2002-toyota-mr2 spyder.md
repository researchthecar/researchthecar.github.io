### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Toyota MR2 Spyder is generally a reliable sports car, particularly with the manual transmission. The naturally aspirated 1.8L engine is robust, though owners should be mindful of potential oil consumption and leaks. The manual transmission is largely trouble-free. However, the optional Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT) has documented issues with its actuator and hydraulic pump, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins like power window motors and ABS sensor issues are not uncommon as the car ages. Exterior concerns primarily revolve around the soft top's condition and potential headlight condensation. Overall, it's a dependable choice for enthusiasts, especially if opting for the manual gearbox and performing regular maintenance.
