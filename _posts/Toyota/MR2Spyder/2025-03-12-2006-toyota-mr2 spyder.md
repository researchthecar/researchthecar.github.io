The 2006 Toyota MR2 Spyder is a two-seat, mid-engine sports car known for its nimble handling and engaging driving experience. It came equipped with a 1.8-liter 1ZZ-FED inline-four engine producing approximately 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed sequential manual transmission (SMT). People generally like the MR2 Spyder for its lightweight design, responsive steering, and open-top driving experience. Common dislikes include limited storage space, a sometimes rough ride, and the SMT transmission's quirks.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FED Inline-Four**

*   **Pre-cat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter, located in the exhaust manifold, can break down and send debris back into the engine. This debris can cause damage to the engine internals, particularly the cylinder walls and piston rings, leading to increased oil consumption and potentially engine failure. Symptoms include increased oil consumption, a rattling noise from the exhaust manifold, and a decrease in engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifold with an aftermarket header that eliminates the pre-cats or installing a new OEM manifold. A compression test can help determine the extent of any damage. Damaged engine components may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the extent of damage and repairs required).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 1ZZ-FED engine is known for excessive oil consumption as it ages. This can be due to worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or issues stemming from pre-cat failure. Symptoms include the need to add oil frequently, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Addressing the underlying cause, which may involve replacing piston rings, valve stem seals, or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the extent of repairs and whether the engine needs to be rebuilt or replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Float**
    *   Description/Symptoms: At higher RPM's, the engine is known to have valve float, potentially leading to engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the engine valve springs with aftermarket springs that provide more force.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Shift Cable Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The bushings on the shift cables can wear out, causing sloppy or difficult shifting. This is especially common in older MR2 Spyders.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn shift cable bushings with new OEM or aftermarket bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT)**

*   **SMT Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMT system relies on a hydraulic pump to build pressure for shifting. The pump can fail over time, leading to slow or no shifting, difficulty engaging gears, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the SMT pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SMT Accumulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMT system also has an accumulator that stores hydraulic pressure. Over time, this accumulator can fail, leading to similar symptoms as pump failure: slow or no shifting, difficulty engaging gears, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the SMT accumulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SMT Clutch Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clutch actuator is responsible for engaging and disengaging the clutch in the SMT system. Failure of the actuator can lead to clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and eventually, complete inability to shift.
    *   Solution: Replacing the SMT clutch actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front strut mounts can wear out and fail, leading to noise (clunking or rattling) over bumps, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken or Sagging Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The springs can break or sag over time, leading to a lower ride height, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. This is more likely to happen on vehicles that are driven hard or exposed to harsh road conditions.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front and/or rear springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oxygen sensors can fail, leading to poor fuel economy, rough idling, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, leading to a dead battery, dim headlights, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft top can be susceptible to damage from the sun, weather, and general wear and tear. This can lead to leaks, tears, and faded appearance.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the soft top.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2006 Toyota MR2 Spyder is a generally reliable sports car but is subject to certain age-related issues. The most serious problems revolve around the 1ZZ-FED engine's oil consumption and the potential for pre-cat failure, which can lead to costly engine repairs. The SMT transmission can also be a source of expensive problems. Suspension components and general wear items like soft tops will require attention as the car ages. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, so a thorough inspection is important before purchasing a used MR2 Spyder.
