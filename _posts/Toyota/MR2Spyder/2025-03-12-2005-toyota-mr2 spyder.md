The 2005 Toyota MR2 Spyder is a popular, lightweight, mid-engine roadster known for its agile handling and fun driving experience. It is powered by a 1.8L 1ZZ-FED inline-4 engine producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed sequential manual transmission (SMT). Owners appreciate its responsive steering, open-air driving experience, and unique styling. Common complaints revolve around its lack of storage space, limited practicality, and sometimes harsh ride.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FED Inline-4**

*   **Pre-Cat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converters located in the exhaust manifold can degrade and disintegrate. The debris gets sucked back into the engine, causing scoring of the cylinder walls and piston rings, leading to excessive oil consumption and eventual engine failure. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, especially on startup or after deceleration, and a noticeable decrease in oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the engine is the most common fix, but some opt for a rebuild with aftermarket pistons and rings designed to prevent oil consumption. Removing or replacing the pre-cats is also an option to prevent future engine damage, though this may affect emissions compliance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ for engine replacement; $2,000 - $4,000 for engine rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken valve springs can cause engine misfires, rough running, loss of power, and potentially severe engine damage if the valve drops into the cylinder. This is more common in high-mileage or track-driven vehicles.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected valve springs, often recommended to replace all valve springs as a preventative measure. A valve job may also be necessary if the valve seats are damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficult Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5-speed manual transmission can develop issues with shifting into gears, especially when cold. This can be due to worn synchronizers, a sticky clutch, or worn shift cables.
    *   Solution: Replacing the synchronizers, lubricating or replacing the shift cables, or replacing the clutch components (clutch disc, pressure plate, throwout bearing).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+, depending on the specific issue and parts needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT)**

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMT system relies on a hydraulic pump to actuate the clutch and shift gears. This pump can fail over time, leading to difficulty shifting, inability to select gears, or complete SMT system failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hydraulic pump. It's also recommended to check the hydraulic fluid level and lines for leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ depending on labor costs and part availability.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The shift actuator is responsible for physically moving the gears within the transmission. It can fail due to wear and tear, causing erratic shifting, inability to shift, or gear selection errors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shift actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ depending on labor costs and part availability.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The suspension bushings, particularly in the control arms and sway bar, can wear out over time. This leads to sloppy handling, clunking noises from the suspension, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the number of bushings replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The strut mounts can deteriorate, causing noise and vibration.
    *   Solution: Replacement of strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensors can fail, triggering the check engine light and potentially affecting fuel economy and engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the sensor location and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **MAF Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: MAF sensor can fail, triggering the check engine light and potentially affecting fuel economy and engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the sensor location and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft top can be susceptible to tears, leaks, and fading due to sun exposure and age.
    *   Solution: Repairing tears or replacing the entire soft top.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the extent of the damage and the type of repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2005 Toyota MR2 Spyder is generally a reliable sports car, but it is prone to certain issues common to its age and design. The most significant concern is the potential for pre-cat failure, which can lead to costly engine damage. SMT models also have specific maintenance needs and potential failure points within the hydraulic system. Suspension components can also wear over time. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, engine and transmission work can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect any prospective purchase.
