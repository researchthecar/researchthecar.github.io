The 2004 Toyota MR2 Spyder is a two-seat, mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its nimble handling and lightweight design. It came equipped with a 1.8-liter 1ZZ-FED inline-4 engine producing approximately 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed sequential manual transmission (SMT). Owners generally appreciate the car's fun-to-drive nature and unique styling, but common complaints often revolve around its limited storage space, harsh ride, and some specific mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FED Inline-4**

*   **Pre-Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter, located in the exhaust manifold, can degrade and disintegrate over time, sending debris into the engine. This can cause excessive oil consumption, piston ring damage, and ultimately, engine failure. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, poor engine performance, and a decrease in fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifold with one that eliminates the pre-cats is the best solution. Regular oil level checks are crucial to catch early signs of this issue. Some owners opt for aftermarket headers without pre-cats as a preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the repair needed (manifold replacement vs. full engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve float and damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 1ZZ-FED engine is prone to valve float at high RPMs, especially when the engine is older. This can lead to valve damage and loss of compression.
    *   Solution: Upgrading to stiffer valve springs and checking the valve tolerances
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on labor, parts and the shop used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT)**

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMT relies on a hydraulic pump to actuate the clutch and shift gears. This pump can fail over time, leading to difficulty shifting, the inability to engage gears, or complete transmission failure. Warning lights related to the SMT system are also common.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clutch actuator is responsible for engaging and disengaging the clutch in the SMT system. Failure can result in difficulty shifting gears, erratic clutch behavior, or complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Sagging Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory springs can sag over time, leading to a lower ride height and reduced handling performance. This can also cause the car to bottom out more easily.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the springs with new OEM or aftermarket options.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (including labor and alignment)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Suspension bushings wear out over time, leading to sloppy handling, increased noise, and vibration. Common areas of concern include the control arm bushings and sway bar bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings. Polyurethane bushings are a popular upgrade for improved durability and handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the number of bushings replaced and the type of bushings used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensors can fail, leading to poor fuel economy, rough idling, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor, depending on location and brand.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, resulting in a dead battery, dimming headlights, and other electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft top is prone to wear and tear, including tears, leaks, and broken straps. The plastic rear window can also become brittle and crack over time.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the soft top.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for minor repairs) to $800+ (for full replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The plastic center console surrounding the radio and shifter can develop cracks, especially around the mounting points and edges. This is often due to sun exposure and age.
    * Solution: Replacement of the center console, or repair using plastic welding or epoxy. Some owners opt to cover or wrap the console to hide the cracks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (DIY repair) - $300+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2004 Toyota MR2 Spyder, while fun to drive, can be prone to certain issues, particularly related to the engine (pre-cat failure) and the SMT transmission (if equipped). Suspension components can also wear out over time. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. The most serious issue is the pre-cat failure, which can lead to expensive engine damage. Owners should be diligent about maintenance and address any symptoms promptly to minimize potential damage and expense.
