The 2011 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Available engines include a 2.7L inline-4 (159 hp, 180 lb-ft of torque) and a 4.0L V6 (236 hp, 266 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic (with the 2.7L) and a 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic (with the 4.0L). People like the Tacoma for its durability, resale value, and off-road prowess. Common complaints include a somewhat stiff ride and limited rear seat space in the Access Cab models.

**Summary**

The 2011 Toyota Tacoma is a generally reliable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of the frame rust issue, especially in areas with road salt usage. The 4.0L V6 engine can experience VVTi oil line leaks, and the 5-speed automatic transmission may develop a torque converter shudder. Suspension leaf spring issues and electrical clock spring failures are also potential concerns. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (oil leaks, clock spring) to potentially major (frame rust requiring replacement). Repair costs vary accordingly, with frame replacement being the most expensive potential repair. Inspecting the frame for rust and checking for transmission shudder are crucial before purchasing.
