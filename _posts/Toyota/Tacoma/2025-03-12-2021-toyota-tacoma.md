The 2021 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. It comes with two engine options: a 2.7L inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 278 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission, though the manual is less common and generally only available on the V6. People like the Tacoma for its ruggedness, strong resale value, and off-road prowess, especially in TRD trims. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated interior, smaller rear seat space in the Access Cab configuration, and fuel economy that is not great compared to some competitors.
