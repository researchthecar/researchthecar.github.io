The 2001 Toyota Tacoma is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing around 142 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L inline-4 producing around 150 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4L V6 producing around 190 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Tacoma for its longevity, build quality, and resale value. Common complaints revolve around a stiff ride, limited interior space in the standard cab models, and potential rust issues, especially in areas with road salt.

**Summary**
The 2001 Toyota Tacoma is a generally reliable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues like frame rust, timing belt replacement (3.4L V6), and suspension wear. Rust is a major concern, especially in colder climates, and can be expensive to repair. Other issues are relatively less severe, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the issue. Regular maintenance, especially timing belt replacement for the V6, is crucial for long-term reliability.
