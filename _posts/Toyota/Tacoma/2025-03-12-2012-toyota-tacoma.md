The 2012 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Engine options included a 2.7L inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 generating 236 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic with the 4-cylinder engine, and a 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic with the V6. Owners often praise the Tacoma for its longevity and resale value but sometimes complain about its fuel economy, ride quality, and interior materials.

**Summary**

The 2012 Toyota Tacoma, while generally reliable, does have some common issues owners should be aware of. The 4.0L V6 engine can suffer from timing cover oil leaks and air injection pump failures. Rust, particularly frame rust, is a major concern, especially in areas where road salt is used. Leaf springs are also prone to rust and breakage. Electrically, clock spring failures can occur. Costs for repairs vary, but some issues like frame rust can be very expensive to address.
