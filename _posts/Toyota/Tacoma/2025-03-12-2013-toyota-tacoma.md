The 2013 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capabilities. Engine options include a 2.7L inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 producing 236 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic (with the 2.7L), and a 5-speed automatic (with the 4.0L). Owners often praise the Tacoma for its durability, resale value, and off-road prowess, but some criticisms include the fuel economy of the V6 engine and the somewhat dated interior.
