The 2019 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. It was available with two engine options: a 2.7L inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 278 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission (though the manual was primarily available with the V6). Owners often praise the Tacoma for its strong resale value, ruggedness, and off-road prowess. Common complaints include a somewhat cramped interior, a firm ride, and occasionally lackluster fuel economy, especially with the V6.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Rough Idle/Shaking at Startup (Cold Start)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported a rough idle or shaking that occurs during cold starts, particularly in colder weather. This issue seems to subside as the engine warms up.
    *   Solution: Some dealerships have performed software updates to the ECU (Engine Control Unit) to adjust fuel trim and idle parameters. Others have replaced the fuel injectors, particularly if diagnostic codes point to a specific cylinder misfire. Some have had success using higher octane fuel or fuel additives.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: ECU reflash is typically covered under warranty. Fuel injector replacement can range from $200-$500 depending on the injector and labor costs.

*   **Valve Spring Recall**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This recall does not necessarily cause symptoms, but is meant to prevent catastrophic engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve springs on affected engines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under recall.
    *   Recalls: 19TA01, 19TA06

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh shifting, particularly between lower gears. Others have experienced hesitation or "gear hunting" on inclines or during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Toyota has issued Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) addressing this issue. The solutions can range from ECU reflashes to transmission fluid changes. In some rare cases, valve body replacement has been necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: ECU reflash is usually covered under warranty. Transmission fluid changes can cost between $150-$300. Valve body replacement can range from $1000 - $2000+.

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay when shifting from Park or Neutral into Drive or Reverse.
    *   Solution: In some cases, it is caused by low transmission fluid level. An oil flush, or transmission replacement will fix it if it is a more serious issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 for fluid flush.

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeak/Creak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint is squeaking or creaking from the rear leaf spring suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Applying grease or lubricant to the leaf spring contact points can temporarily alleviate the noise. Some owners have replaced the leaf springs with aftermarket options.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Lubrication can be a DIY fix. Aftermarket leaf springs can range from $500 - $1000+ for the parts and installation.

**Electrical**

*   **Entune System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Entune infotainment system can experience various glitches, including freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In some cases, replacing the entire head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free at the dealership. Head unit replacement can range from $500 - $1500+.

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Blind Spot Monitor, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failures or intermittent malfunctions of the blind spot monitor system or parking sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific sensor that is failing and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the sensor and labor.

**Exterior**

*   **Third Brake Light Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the third brake light housing, leading to water intrusion into the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacing the gasket or resealing the third brake light.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on whether it's a DIY fix or professional repair.

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various rattling or buzzing noises from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior components.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and applying sound deadening material or tightening loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: This can often be a DIY fix. Professional sound deadening installation can range from $200-$500+.

**Summary:**

The 2019 Toyota Tacoma generally exhibits the reliability Toyota is known for, but like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. The engine and transmission issues (rough idle, harsh shifting) can be annoying but are often addressed with software updates or minor repairs. The leaf spring squeak is a common annoyance. Electrical issues with the Entune system and sensor malfunctions can range from minor glitches to more significant problems. The third brake light leak is a relatively minor issue. While some fixes are inexpensive, some repairs like transmission work or head unit replacement can be costly. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially expensive repairs. Prospective buyers should be aware of these common issues and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing.
