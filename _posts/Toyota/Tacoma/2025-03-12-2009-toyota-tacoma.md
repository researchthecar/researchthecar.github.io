The 2009 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Available engine options include a 2.7L inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 that generates 236 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic for the 2.7L engine, and a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic for the 4.0L engine. Owners often praise the Tacoma for its durability, strong resale value, and off-road prowess. Common complaints often include less than stellar fuel economy from the V6 engine, and some owners dislike the interior styling.

**Summary**

The 2009 Toyota Tacoma, while generally reliable, does have a few common issues to be aware of. Frame rust, if present, is a significant concern, primarily in regions where road salt is used. Check for previous recall work, particularly regarding the frame. Other potential issues, such as valve cover gasket leaks, throwout bearing failure (manual transmission), and leaf spring corrosion, are more manageable in terms of cost and severity. Overall, the Tacoma remains a solid choice, but a thorough inspection is recommended, especially focusing on the frame and suspension.
