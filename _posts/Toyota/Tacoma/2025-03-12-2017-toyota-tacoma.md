The 2017 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capabilities. Engine options include a 2.7L inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 278 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic and a 6-speed manual (available only on the V6). Owners often praise the Tacoma for its strong resale value, off-road prowess, and dependability. However, common complaints include a sometimes-uncomfortable driving position, lackluster fuel economy for the V6, and some interior materials that feel cheap.
