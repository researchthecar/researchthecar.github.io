**Introduction:**

The 1995 Toyota Tacoma is a compact pickup truck that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The standard engine was a 2.4-liter inline-four that produced 116 horsepower and 142 lb-ft of torque. Optional engines included a 2.7-liter inline-four that produced 150 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4-liter V6 that produced 190 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a five-speed manual, a four-speed automatic, and a five-speed automatic.

The Tacoma was praised for its reliability, off-road capabilities, and value for money. However, it was also criticized for its cramped interior, lack of power from the smaller engines, and poor fuel economy.
