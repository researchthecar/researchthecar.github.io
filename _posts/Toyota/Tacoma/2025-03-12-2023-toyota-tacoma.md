The 2023 Toyota Tacoma is a mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. It's available with two engine options: a 2.7-liter inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.5-liter V6 generating 278 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission (only available on the V6). Many owners appreciate the Tacoma's ruggedness and strong resale value, while common criticisms include its outdated interior, lower fuel economy compared to competitors, and somewhat cramped rear seating in the Double Cab configuration.

The severity of these issues varies, with some being minor annoyances and others requiring more significant repairs. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like lubricating leaf springs to more costly replacements of fuel injectors or head units. While not widespread, these potential issues should be considered by prospective buyers.
