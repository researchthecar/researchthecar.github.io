The 2014 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Engine options include a 2.7L 4-cylinder producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 producing 236 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic with the 4-cylinder engine and a 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic with the V6 engine. Owners often praise the Tacoma's durability, resale value, and off-road prowess. Common complaints include lower fuel economy compared to newer trucks and some dated interior features.

**Engine**

**2.7L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the 2.7L engine consuming more oil than expected, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels closely and using a heavier weight oil might help reduce consumption. In severe cases, engine repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the cause and repair needed. Could range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.0L V6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks originating from the valve cover gaskets. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (2.7L)**

*   No Issues Found

**5-Speed Automatic (4.0L)**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Rust/Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature rusting and corrosion of the rear leaf springs, especially in areas with road salt exposure. This can lead to weakened springs and potentially affect ride quality and load-carrying capacity. Some owners report leaf springs breaking.
    *   Solution: Applying rust preventative coatings can help mitigate rust. Severely corroded or broken springs need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800+ per spring, depending on aftermarket vs. OEM and labor costs.
    *   Recalls:
    *   **Recall Number: 13V-583** Toyota recalled certain 2005-2011 Tacoma vehicles because of potential fracture of the rear leaf spring.
    *   **Recall Number: 16V-695** Toyota recalled certain 2005-2014 Tacoma vehicles because of potential fracture of the rear leaf spring.

**Electrical**

*   **Clock Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the clock spring in the steering wheel. Symptoms include the airbag warning light illuminating, non-functional steering wheel controls (e.g., radio, cruise control), and potentially a non-functional horn.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clock spring assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Frame Rust/Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Significant frame rust and corrosion, especially in areas with road salt usage. This can weaken the frame and compromise the vehicle's structural integrity.
    *   Solution: Applying rust preventative coatings or undercoating can help slow down rust. Severely rusted frames may require extensive repairs or even vehicle buyback.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies significantly depending on the severity of the rust. Minor surface rust treatment may cost a few hundred dollars. Severe frame damage can cost thousands or require a new frame.
    *   Recalls:
    *   **Recall Number: 16V-024** Toyota recalled certain 2005-2011 Tacoma vehicles because of potential excessive corrosion of the frame.

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag warning light illuminating on the dashboard. This can be caused by various issues within the airbag system, including faulty sensors, wiring problems, or issues with the airbag control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify the cause of the airbag light. Repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Toyota Tacoma generally exhibits good reliability but has a few common issues. Frame rust and leaf spring corrosion are major concerns, especially in areas with road salt. These can be costly to repair and compromise the vehicle's safety. The valve cover gaskets and clock spring are comparatively less severe but can still be inconvenient. The 2.7L engine may experience excessive oil consumption, which should be monitored. Overall, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the frame and undercarriage for rust and be aware of the potential for other listed issues.
