The 2022 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. It comes standard with a 2.7-liter inline-4 engine producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. An optional 3.5-liter V6 engine generates 278 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic and a 6-speed manual (available only with the V6). People often praise the Tacoma for its ruggedness, strong resale value, and off-road prowess. However, some criticisms include its dated interior, lower fuel economy compared to competitors, and a somewhat cramped rear seat in the Access Cab configuration.
