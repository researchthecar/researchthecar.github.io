The 2007 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Engine options include a 2.7L Inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 generating 236 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic (I4), and 5-speed automatic (V6). Owners appreciate the Tacoma's ruggedness and resale value, but some have reported issues with rust, particularly in regions with road salt. The truck's relatively compact size is seen as both a benefit for maneuverability and a drawback for interior space by different owners.
