The 2018 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Engine options include a 2.7L inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 278 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic and a 6-speed manual (available only with the V6). Owners often praise the Tacoma for its strong resale value and off-road prowess, while some common complaints include the truck's somewhat dated interior, lower fuel economy compared to some competitors, and the sometimes-jittery ride.

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Rough Idle/Shaking at Startup**

**Summary**

The 2018 Toyota Tacoma is generally a reliable truck, but like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. The most prevalent issues seem to be related to the 3.5L V6 engine, specifically carbon buildup, and to the 6-speed automatic transmission, with reports of harsh shifting. Electrical issues with the Entune system are also common. Suspension squeaks are minor and easily addressed. The cost of repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like fluid changes and software updates to more substantial expenses for engine cleaning, timing cover resealing, or transmission work. While no widespread recalls seem to be directly linked to the most common problems, it's always a good idea to check the vehicle's VIN for any outstanding recalls. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their decision-making process and inspection when purchasing a used 2018 Tacoma.
