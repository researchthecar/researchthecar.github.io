### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Toyota Tacoma is a highly reliable truck, with its powertrain generally being very robust. The most significant potential issues tend to be head gasket failures on both engine options, though these are not universal and often related to age and maintenance. The manual transmission is exceptionally durable, and the automatic is also known for its longevity. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear over time, especially with heavy use. Electrical components like the alternator and power window motors are common failure points as the vehicle ages. Exterior concerns primarily revolve around rust, particularly on the frame in certain climates, and paint degradation. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing age-related wear, the 2000 Tacoma remains a dependable choice.
