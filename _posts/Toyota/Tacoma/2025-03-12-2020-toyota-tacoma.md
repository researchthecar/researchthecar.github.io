The 2020 Toyota Tacoma is a mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability, off-road capability, and strong resale value. Engine options include a 2.7L inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 generating 278 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are available with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 can also be paired with a 6-speed manual. While owners appreciate the Tacoma's ruggedness and dependability, some common complaints include lackluster fuel economy, a cramped rear seat in the Access Cab configuration, and a somewhat dated interior compared to newer competitors.

**Summary**

The 2020 Toyota Tacoma generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but owners have reported a few recurring issues. The most common complaints relate to rough idling on the 3.5L V6, the transmission exhibiting harsh shifts, squeaking rear leaf springs, and issues with the Entune infotainment system. While some problems can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes like software updates or lubrication, others, such as transmission repairs or head unit replacements, can be more costly. While the issues exist, they are not severe enough to be a major cause of concern.
