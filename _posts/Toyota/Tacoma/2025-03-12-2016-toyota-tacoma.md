The 2016 Toyota Tacoma marked the beginning of the third generation for this popular mid-size truck. Engine options included a 2.7L inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 generating 278 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic, depending on the engine. Owners often praise the Tacoma for its reliability, off-road capability, and strong resale value. Common complaints include the stiff ride, less than stellar fuel economy, and some reported issues with the automatic transmission and rear differential.

**Summary**

The 2016 Toyota Tacoma, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The most concerning and potentially costly are the transmission problems and the potential for engine issues like oil leaks or knocking. Electrical glitches with the Entune system and the rear leaf spring squeaking are common annoyances. While recalls are rare, be mindful of the potential for water leaks around the third brake light. Overall, pre-purchase inspections and addressing any identified issues promptly can help ensure a positive ownership experience. The price range for potential repairs spans from minor fixes costing under $100 to major repairs exceeding $3000, so it's important to assess the vehicle's condition carefully.
