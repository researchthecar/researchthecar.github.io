The 2002 Toyota Tacoma is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capabilities. It was offered with several engine options including a 2.4L inline-4 (142 hp and 160 lb-ft of torque), a 2.7L inline-4 (150 hp and 177 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.4L V6 (190 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Tacoma's longevity, dependability, and strong resale value. Common dislikes include the relatively small interior size, especially in regular cab models, and the potential for frame rust in certain regions.
