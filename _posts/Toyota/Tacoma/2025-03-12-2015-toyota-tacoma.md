The 2015 Toyota Tacoma is a popular mid-size truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. The 2015 model came with two engine options: a 2.7L inline-4 producing 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 producing 236 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (only available with the 2.7L engine), a 4-speed automatic (only available with the 2.7L engine), and a 5-speed automatic (only available with the 4.0L engine). Owners appreciate the Tacoma's durability and resale value but often cite its somewhat dated interior and fuel economy as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline-4**

*   **Rough Idle/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a rough idle, especially when the engine is cold. There may also be hesitation upon acceleration. This can be attributed to a number of issues such as a dirty MAF sensor, a vacuum leak, or worn spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the MAF sensor, inspecting and replacing vacuum lines, replacing spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.0L V6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover gaskets onto the engine. Visible oil around the valve cover, burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Secondary Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes related to the secondary air injection system. Loud noise from the pump area upon startup. This system is prone to failure in colder climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the secondary air injection pump and/or valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250 for fluid service, $800 - $3000+ for more extensive repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (A750F/A750E)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration felt during light acceleration, typically at highway speeds. Often related to torque converter lockup.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush with updated fluid formulation (Toyota WS fluid). In some cases, torque converter replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250 for fluid service, $500 - $1500+ for torque converter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Rust/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs prone to rusting, especially in areas with road salt. Can lead to sagging rear suspension or, in extreme cases, leaf spring breakage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear. Potential for catastrophic failure leading to loss of control.
    *   Solution: Replacing lower ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Clock Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of horn function, airbag light on, issues with steering wheel controls.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clock spring.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Frame Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Significant frame rust, especially in areas that use road salt. Can compromise structural integrity.
    *   Solution: Frame replacement (if eligible under recall), rust repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on severity. Repair $500 - $2000+, Frame Replacement $10,000+ (if covered by recall, it's free)

**Summary**

The 2015 Toyota Tacoma, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. Frame rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Engine issues like valve cover gasket leaks and secondary air injection pump failures, along with potential transmission problems such as torque converter shudder can lead to relatively high repair costs. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are also areas to inspect. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be more costly to address. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed to assess the vehicle's condition and identify potential problems.
