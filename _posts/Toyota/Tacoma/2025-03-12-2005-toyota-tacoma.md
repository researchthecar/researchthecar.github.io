The 2005 Toyota Tacoma marked the beginning of the second generation of this popular mid-size pickup truck. It was offered with several engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.7L inline-4 producing around 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 4.0L V6 was also available, delivering approximately 236 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (for the 2.7L) or a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic (for the 4.0L). People generally appreciate the Tacoma for its reliability, off-road capability, and strong resale value. Common complaints revolve around frame rust issues (particularly in earlier models), and some specific engine/transmission quirks.

**Frame**

*   **Frame Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Severe rust, especially in areas with road salt usage, leading to potential structural failure and safety concerns. Visible rust perforation.
    *   Solution: Frame replacement (covered under recall in some cases, if it meets the requirements for the recall), rust repair/encapsulation (less reliable, temporary solution).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Frame replacement could be $10,000+, rust repair varies greatly.
    *   Recalls: Recall # 05V225000, 10V025000, 14V573000

**Summary**

The 2005 Toyota Tacoma is generally a reliable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly frame rust. The severity and cost of repair for the frame rust can be significant, making a thorough inspection crucial. Other issues, such as valve cover leaks and tailgate handle breakage, are generally less severe and less costly to address. The 4.0L V6 automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting, while the manual transmission can be prone to throwout bearing issues. Overall, the Tacoma is a solid choice but requires careful inspection before purchase due to these potential problem areas.
