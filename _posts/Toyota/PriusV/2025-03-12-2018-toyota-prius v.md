The 2018 Toyota Prius V is a hybrid wagon offering practicality and fuel efficiency. It's powered by a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system. The engine produces 98 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque, while the electric motor adds additional power for a combined output of 134 horsepower. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is the only transmission option. Owners generally appreciate the Prius V's spacious interior, excellent gas mileage, and smooth ride. Some common complaints include lackluster acceleration, a somewhat dated interior design, and the road noise that comes with a hybrid vehicle.

**Engine**

**1.8L 2ZR-FXE 4-Cylinder Hybrid**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between service intervals. This can sometimes be indicated by the low oil pressure light illuminating or the engine running roughly.
    *   Solution: Closely monitor oil levels and add oil as needed. In severe cases, engine work may be required, such as piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting or jerking sensations, particularly at lower speeds or during acceleration. This can sometimes be attributed to software glitches.
    *   Solution: A transmission software update from a Toyota dealer may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, internal transmission damage may necessitate replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for a software update; $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Hybrid System**

*   **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hybrid battery pack's capacity can degrade over time, leading to reduced fuel economy, decreased electric-only range, and eventually, a hybrid system warning light.

**Summary:**

The 2018 Toyota Prius V is generally a reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with excessive oil consumption, transmission harshness, hybrid battery degradation, and electrical glitches.
