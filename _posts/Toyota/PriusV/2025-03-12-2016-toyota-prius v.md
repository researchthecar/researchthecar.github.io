The 2016 Toyota Prius V is a hybrid wagon offering increased cargo space and passenger room compared to the standard Prius. It utilizes a 1.8-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 134 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered through a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Prius V for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and smooth ride. However, some common complaints include a less engaging driving experience compared to traditional wagons, and lackluster acceleration, particularly when fully loaded.

**Engine**

**1.8L 2ZR-FXE Inline-4 Hybrid**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between scheduled oil changes. This can be observed by checking the oil level regularly and noticing a consistent decrease.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and potentially switching to a higher viscosity oil may help. If consumption is severe, engine repairs or replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (for oil change) - $3,000+ (for engine repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inverter Coolant Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inverter coolant pump, responsible for cooling the hybrid system's inverter, can fail. Symptoms include warning lights on the dashboard, reduced hybrid system performance, and potential overheating of the inverter.
    *   Solution: Replace the inverter coolant pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ECVT (Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a hesitation or lag in acceleration, particularly when attempting to accelerate quickly from a stop or at lower speeds. This is sometimes described as a delay in the CVT responding to throttle input.
    *   Solution: While the CVT is designed for fuel efficiency and smooth transitions, some drivers find the response unsatisfying. There isn't a specific repair for this, as it's often attributed to the nature of the CVT. Some have had success with software updates, but results vary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if covered by warranty/software update) - $150+ (for diagnostic fee)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, particularly when the vehicle is frequently loaded with cargo or passengers. This can result in a lower ride height, reduced suspension travel, and a harsher ride.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shocks or springs. Airbags can be used in the rear coils to help support extra weight.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hybrid battery life varies, but some owners have experienced premature battery failure. Symptoms include reduced fuel economy, decreased hybrid system performance, warning lights on the dashboard, and the inability to start the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replace the hybrid battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000-$4,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery, responsible for starting the car and powering accessories, can experience premature drain, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently. Symptoms include difficulty starting the car or electrical malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replace the 12V battery with an OEM replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation. This can reduce headlight effectiveness and potentially damage the bulbs or housings over time.
    *   Solution: Some owners drill small drain holes in the bottom of the housings, but this is not recommended. The proper solution is to reseal the headlight housing or replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In some climates, the dashboard material can crack or warp due to heat exposure.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Toyota Prius V has a mix of potential issues. The most concerning and potentially costly issues involve the hybrid battery and engine oil consumption. The remaining issues, like suspension sagging, headlight condensation, and dashboard cracking, are less severe but can still require attention and expense. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget accordingly for potential repairs.
