## Engine

### 1.8L 4-Cylinder Hybrid Synergy Drive
**Inverter Water Pump Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Overheating of the hybrid system, dashboard warning lights (e.g., "Check Hybrid System"), reduced power, or inability to drive.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the inverter water pump. This is an electric pump that circulates coolant specifically for the hybrid inverter.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Hybrid Battery Degradation**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced electric-only driving range, decreased overall fuel economy, rough acceleration, and potential for the gasoline engine to run more frequently.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the hybrid battery pack. This is a significant repair.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $4,000

### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Toyota Prius V demonstrates strong overall reliability, particularly in its powertrain and transmission components, aligning with Toyota's reputation. The primary concerns revolve around the hybrid system's auxiliary water pump and the eventual degradation of the hybrid battery pack, which are significant but not uncommon for hybrid vehicles of this age. The 12V auxiliary battery can also be a point of failure. Beyond these hybrid-specific items, the vehicle's conventional components, including suspension, exterior, and interior systems, generally hold up well with minimal widespread issues reported. Regular maintenance, especially fluid checks for the hybrid system, is recommended to ensure longevity.
