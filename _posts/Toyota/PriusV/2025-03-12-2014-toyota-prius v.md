The 2014 Toyota Prius V is a hybrid wagon offering increased cargo space and passenger room compared to the standard Prius. It comes with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine (2ZR-FXE) paired with a hybrid system, delivering a combined 134 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. All models utilize an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). Owners generally appreciate the Prius V for its excellent fuel economy and spaciousness but dislike its somewhat sluggish acceleration and occasionally vague steering feel.

**Engine**

**1.8L 2ZR-FXE Hybrid**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled changes. Visible exhaust smoke may or may not be present.
    *   Solution: A compression and leak-down test is needed to diagnose the condition of the engine. Replacing the piston rings or replacing the engine entirely is the most common repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inverter Coolant Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inverter coolant pump circulates coolant to regulate the temperature of the inverter, which is a crucial component of the hybrid system. Failure of this pump can lead to overheating of the inverter and potential hybrid system failure. Symptoms include warning lights on the dashboard (e.g., check hybrid system light) and potential loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the inverter coolant pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blown head gasket can cause engine overheating, white smoke from exhaust, coolant loss, and mixing of coolant and oil.
    *   Solution: Replace head gasket
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ECVT (Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission)**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shocks Wear Out Prematurely**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride comfort, excessive bouncing over bumps, uneven tire wear, and potentially clunking noises from the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Combination Meter Failure (Dashboard Display)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The combination meter, which displays speed, fuel level, and other important information, can fail. Symptoms include flickering, dimming, or complete loss of the display.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the combination meter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, decreased acceleration, and shorter electric-only driving range. A "Check Hybrid System" warning light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Hybrid battery replacement or reconditioning (if possible).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ for a new battery; less for reconditioning.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks from Tail Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water accumulating inside the tail light housing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Tail Light Housing or resealing with silicon.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Toyota Prius V generally offers a reliable and fuel-efficient driving experience, but owners have reported some issues, including excessive oil consumption, hybrid battery degradation, and dashboard cracking. While some repairs, like replacing rear shocks, are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or hybrid battery replacement, can be costly. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs, so a thorough inspection before purchase is advisable.
