The 2017 Toyota Prius V is a hybrid wagon offering enhanced cargo space and passenger comfort compared to the standard Prius. It utilizes a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired with Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system, delivering a combined 134 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. Fuel efficiency is a key selling point, though some owners find the acceleration lacking. Commonly praised are its roomy interior, practicality, and reliability. Some owners dislike the somewhat bland styling and occasionally rough ride.

**Engine**

**1.8L 2ZR-FXE Inline-4 Hybrid**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil pressure light illuminating or the engine making unusual noises.
    * Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings has resolved the issue. A compression test can help diagnose the problem.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) cooler can crack and leak coolant into the exhaust system or even the engine. This can lead to reduced engine performance, white smoke from the exhaust, or even engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacing the EGR cooler is the typical fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**
* **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience sagging of the rear suspension, especially when carrying heavy loads. This can lead to a less comfortable ride and potentially affect handling.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear shocks and/or springs can correct the sagging. Upgrading to heavier-duty components may be necessary if frequently carrying heavy loads.

**Summary**
The 2017 Toyota Prius V generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but some common issues exist. Excessive oil consumption and EGR cooler failures for the engine and sagging of the rear suspension are the most prevalent mechanical issues. Electrical issues like 12V battery drain also affect owners. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for a battery replacement to several thousand for inverter or engine work. Overall, while some issues can be costly, the Prius V remains a practical and fuel-efficient choice.
