The 2020 Toyota 86 is a popular rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its engaging handling and affordability. It features a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed (boxer) four-cylinder engine producing 205 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque when equipped with the manual transmission, or 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque with the automatic. It is available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 86's nimble handling, communicative steering, and overall fun-to-drive factor, but some common complaints include the lack of low-end torque, road noise, and somewhat basic interior.

**Summary**

The 2020 Toyota 86 is a generally reliable sports car, but like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. Engine problems, while less common, can be costly, especially if fuel injector issues arise or valve spring failure occurs on earlier models. Transmission issues, specifically synchro wear in the manual and rough shifting in the automatic, are worth noting. Suspension issues are not overly common but should still be inspected. Electrical and interior issues are generally less severe, but head unit malfunctions and rattles can be frustrating. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect any used 2020 Toyota 86 before purchase. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work.
