The 2017 Toyota 86 is a rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its handling and fun driving experience. It comes equipped with a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed (flat) four-cylinder engine, producing around 205 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque when equipped with the manual transmission, and slightly less with the automatic. Available transmissions are a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 86 for its affordability, lightweight design, and engaging driving dynamics. However, some common complaints include the lack of low-end torque, engine noise in the cabin, and basic interior features.

    * Solution: Replace the rear springs or struts. Upgrading to aftermarket springs can provide a more durable and performance-oriented solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$800

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**

**Summary**

The 2017 Toyota 86 is a fun sports car with a few potential issues. The most serious and potentially expensive problem is the valve spring issue, which is covered by a recall but can lead to significant engine damage if not addressed. Transmission grinding in the manual is also a concern for some owners. Other issues like suspension sag, bushing wear, and electrical problems are less severe but can impact the overall ownership experience. The thin paint is a common complaint but is primarily cosmetic. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history, listen for any unusual noises, and confirm that the valve spring recall has been addressed if applicable.
