The 2013 Toyota FJ Cruiser is a rugged and capable off-road SUV known for its retro styling and reliability. It came standard with a 4.0L V6 engine (1GR-FE) producing 260 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission (available on 4x4 models). Owners appreciate its off-road prowess, distinctive design, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Some common dislikes include its limited cargo space, blind spots, and fuel economy.
