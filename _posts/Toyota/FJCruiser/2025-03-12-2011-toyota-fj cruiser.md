The 2011 Toyota FJ Cruiser is a rugged and retro-styled SUV known for its off-road capabilities and distinctive design. It came standard with a 4.0-liter V6 engine producing 260 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission. Many owners appreciate its distinctive looks and off-road prowess, while some dislike its poor fuel economy, blind spots, and less-than-refined on-road manners.
