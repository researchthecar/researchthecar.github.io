### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser is generally a reliable vehicle, particularly its powertrain. The 4.0L V6 engine and available transmissions have proven durable. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil leaks from valve covers or camshaft seals and occasional water pump failures. Electrical gremlins, like crankshaft position sensor issues and instrument cluster malfunctions, can occur. Externally, frame rust is a significant concern, especially in rust-belt regions, and the rear door mechanism can sometimes be finicky. Despite these points, the FJ Cruiser's robust build and Toyota's reputation for longevity make it a solid choice for those seeking an adventure-ready SUV, provided these potential issues are addressed.
