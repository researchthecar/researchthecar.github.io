The 2010 Toyota FJ Cruiser is a rugged and capable SUV that has garnered a loyal following among enthusiasts. It is powered by a 4.0-liter V6 engine that produces 239 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission. The FJ Cruiser offers a unique styling that sets it apart from other SUVs, but it also has some drawbacks that potential buyers should be aware of.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** A common issue on the 4.0L V6 engine is a leaking valve cover gasket. This can cause oil to leak onto the engine, which can lead to smoke and engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms include oil under the vehicle, blue smoke from the exhaust, and low engine oil levels. The solution is to replace the valve cover gasket, which costs around $100 to $200 for parts and labor.
* **Leaking Timing Chain Cover:** Another potential issue with the 4.0L V6 is a leaking timing chain cover. This can cause oil to leak from the front of the engine, which can lead to engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms include oil under the vehicle, a ticking noise from the engine, and low engine oil levels. The solution is to replace the timing chain cover, which costs around $500 to $1,000 for parts and labor.
* **P0420 and P0430 Codes:** These codes refer to a problem with the catalytic converter. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including a faulty converter, an oxygen sensor problem, or an exhaust leak. Symptoms include a check engine light, a decrease in engine power, and increased fuel consumption. The solution is to diagnose and replace the faulty component, which can cost anywhere from $200 to $1,000 or more depending on the issue.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (A750F)**

* **Torque Converter Shudder:** Some owners of the 5-speed automatic transmission have reported a shuddering sensation during acceleration. This is caused by a faulty torque converter, which can lead to transmission damage if not addressed. Symptoms include a shuddering or vibration during acceleration, especially at low speeds. The solution is to replace the torque converter, which costs around $2,000 to $3,000 for parts and labor.
* **Slipping Transmission:** Another potential issue with the 5-speed automatic transmission is slipping. This can cause the transmission to lose power or shift erratically, which can make the vehicle difficult or impossible to drive. Symptoms include a loss of power, erratic shifting, or slipping gears. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission, which can cost anywhere from $2,500 to $5,000 or more.

**6-Speed Manual (RA60)**

* **No Major Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Leaking Struts:** Some owners of the FJ Cruiser have reported leaking front struts. This can cause a loss of suspension performance and can lead to damage to the suspension components if not addressed. Symptoms include a spongy or bouncy ride, uneven tire wear, and oil leaking from the struts. The solution is to replace the leaking struts, which costs around $500 to $1,000 for parts and labor.
* **Rear Sway Bar Links:** The rear sway bar links on the FJ Cruiser can become worn or damaged, which can lead to a clunking or rattling noise from the rear of the vehicle. Symptoms include a clunking or rattling noise from the rear of the vehicle, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces. The solution is to replace the sway bar links, which costs around $100 to $200 for parts and labor.

The solution is to replace the alternator, which costs around $500 to $1,000 for parts and labor.
* **Battery Drain:** Some owners of the FJ Cruiser have reported battery drain issues. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including a faulty alternator, a parasitic drain, or a weak battery. Symptoms include a dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle, or a check engine light. The solution is to diagnose and fix the underlying cause of the battery drain, which can cost anywhere from $100 to $500 or more depending on the issue.

**Exterior**

* **Rust**

* **Frame Rust:** The FJ Cruiser is known to have a rust issue on the frame. This can lead to structural damage and can compromise the safety of the vehicle.
