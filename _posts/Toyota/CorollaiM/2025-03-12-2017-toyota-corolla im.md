The 2017 Toyota Corolla iM is a hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and practicality. It comes equipped with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 137 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and standard features, but some dislike its somewhat underpowered engine and basic interior styling.

**Engine**

**1.8L 2ZR-FAE**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, visible exhaust smoke (in severe cases), and potential engine damage if the oil level is not maintained.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels, using the correct viscosity oil, and potentially a compression test to evaluate engine health. In some cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary, but can be costly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (K312)**

*   **CVT juddering or hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported juddering or hesitation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to find the right gear ratio.
    *   Solution: Perform a CVT fluid flush/change using Toyota CVT fluid. If the problem persists, the transmission may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (fluid change), $3,000 - $5,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect and potentially replace rear sway bar bushings or end links. Also check shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (bushings/end links), $200 - $500+ (shocks)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera display. The screen may show a black image, a distorted image, or no image at all.
    *   Solution: Check the camera wiring and connections for damage or corrosion. If the wiring is good, the camera itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Driver's Seat Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noise emanating from the driver's seat while driving, particularly when shifting weight or going around corners.
    *   Solution: Lubricate seat tracks and pivot points. In some cases, seat frame repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50 (lubrication), $100 - $500+ (repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Toyota Corolla iM generally demonstrates good reliability. The most notable issues include potential CVT juddering and occasional excessive oil consumption. Suspension noises and electrical glitches with the backup camera can also occur. Most of these issues are relatively minor and can be addressed without excessive expense. The most severe issue of CVT replacement could be quite costly.
