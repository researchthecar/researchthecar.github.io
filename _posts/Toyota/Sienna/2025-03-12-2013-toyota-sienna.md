The 2013 Toyota Sienna is a popular minivan known for its reliability, spaciousness, and comfortable ride. It offered two engine options: a 2.7L 4-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque and a more powerful 3.5L V6 engine generating 266 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Sienna's practicality, smooth handling, and available all-wheel drive. Some common dislikes include the van's somewhat bland styling and occasionally reported issues with certain components.
