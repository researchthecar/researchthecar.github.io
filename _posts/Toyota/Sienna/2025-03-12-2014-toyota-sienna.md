The 2014 Toyota Sienna is a popular minivan known for its reliability, spaciousness, and comfortable ride. It offered seating for up to eight passengers and ample cargo space, making it a favorite for families. Engine options included a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque (available on the base model) and a more powerful 3.5-liter V6 engine rated at 266 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sienna's smooth ride, spacious interior, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. However, some common complaints include the van's somewhat bland styling, perceived lack of driving excitement, and potential for certain mechanical issues as the vehicle ages.

**Summary**

The 2014 Toyota Sienna is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it can experience certain issues as it ages. Common problems include oil leaks, water pump failure (primarily with the V6 engine), transmission shudder, and electrical issues with the sliding doors and backup camera. Suspension wear and tear are also common. Dashboard cracking and Bluetooth connectivity problems are also reported. While some repairs, like replacing valve cover gaskets or shocks, are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission or sliding door repairs, can be more costly. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues vary depending on the vehicle's maintenance history, driving conditions, and location. Potential buyers should have a mechanic inspect the vehicle before purchase and be prepared to address these potential problems as they arise.
