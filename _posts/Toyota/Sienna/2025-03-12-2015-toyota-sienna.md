The 2015 Toyota Sienna is a popular minivan known for its reliability, spacious interior, and available all-wheel drive. The sole engine option for this year is a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 266 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its comfortable ride, ample storage, and reputation for longevity. However, some common complaints include the dated infotainment system and uninspired styling.

**Summary**

The 2015 Toyota Sienna, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. Oil leaks and water pump failures are the most frequently reported engine problems. Rough shifting can occur with the 6-speed transmission. Suspension issues like sagging and strut mount noise are also noted. Electrical problems, particularly with the sliding doors and backup camera, can be frustrating. The severity of these issues varies, with engine and transmission repairs potentially costing several thousand dollars. The other issues are generally less expensive to address.
