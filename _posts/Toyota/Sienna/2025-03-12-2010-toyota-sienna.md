The 2010 Toyota Sienna is a popular minivan known for its reliability, spacious interior, and smooth ride. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.7L 4-cylinder engine producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.5L V6 engine generating 266 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sienna's versatility and dependability, but some common complaints include issues with the sliding doors, excessive oil consumption in some V6 models, and certain electrical problems.
**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2010 Sienna models with the 3.5L V6 engine have been reported to consume excessive amounts of oil, sometimes requiring owners to add oil frequently between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored closely. Blue smoke may also be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The repair varies depending on the severity. For some, switching to a heavier weight oil or addressing PCV valve issues may help. In more severe cases, engine components like piston rings may need replacement or ultimately an engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve) to $2000 - $5000+ (Engine Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (U660E/U760E)**
*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration or cruising, particularly at lower speeds. This issue is often associated with the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission flush may temporarily alleviate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or abrupt shifting between gears, especially noticeable during upshifts or downshifts. This can be accompanied by clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary. In severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) to $2500 - $4500+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension may sag over time, especially if the vehicle is frequently used for hauling heavy loads. This can lead to a reduced ride height, poor handling, and bottoming out over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear springs or installation of air springs to provide additional support.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Electrical**

*   **Sliding Door Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors may fail to open or close properly, get stuck, or make unusual noises. This can be caused by issues with the door motor, cables, rollers, or sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the specific component causing the problem. This may involve replacing the motor, cables, rollers, or sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks may fail to operate correctly, with some doors not locking or unlocking with the remote or switch. This is commonly caused by a failing door lock actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may fail to open or close correctly, become stuck, or make unusual noises. This can be caused by motor issues, sensor malfunctions, or problems with the liftgate struts.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the specific component causing the problem. This might involve replacing the motor, sensors, or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $800+

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or splitting of the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (cover) - $1500+ (replacement)

**Summary:**

The 2010 Toyota Sienna, while generally a reliable vehicle, does have some common issues owners should be aware of. The most concerning problems involve the 3.5L V6 engine's excessive oil consumption and the 6-speed transmission's torque converter shudder and harsh shifting. Electrical issues with the sliding doors and power door locks are also relatively frequent. The severity and cost of these repairs can vary widely, with engine and transmission work potentially being the most expensive. While some issues are minor and inexpensive to fix, others can require significant investment. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect used Siennas and address any identified problems promptly to prevent further damage and expense.
