The 2024 Toyota Sienna is a popular minivan known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and reliability. All 2024 Sienna models come standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 245 horsepower. It is available only as a hybrid. Owners often praise its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and standard safety features, but some dislike its acceleration compared to V6-powered minivans and the higher price point compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2024 Toyota Sienna generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but some owners have reported issues with the engine noise, transmission hesitation, electrical system glitches, and interior noises. While some problems are relatively minor and easily addressed, others can be more costly and disruptive. The most severe issues tend to be related to the transmission, which could potentially result in a expensive repair. Overall, the Sienna seems to be a well-built minivan that may be susceptible to minor annoyances that can potentially turn into severe issues, so it is very important to research the vehicle and stay on top of the maintenance schedule.
