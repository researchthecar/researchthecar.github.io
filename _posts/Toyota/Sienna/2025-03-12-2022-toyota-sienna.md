The 2022 Toyota Sienna is a popular minivan known for its fuel efficiency due to its standard hybrid powertrain. It is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, delivering a combined 245 horsepower. All models use a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and are available in either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive configurations. People often praise the Sienna for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and excellent gas mileage. However, some common complaints include the drone-like noise of the CVT transmission under heavy acceleration and the less-than-sporty driving experience.
