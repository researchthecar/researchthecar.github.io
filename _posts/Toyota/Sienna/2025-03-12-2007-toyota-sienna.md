The 2007 Toyota Sienna is a popular minivan known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine options: a 2.7L 4-cylinder (187 hp, 186 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.5L V6 (266 hp, 245 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sienna for its smooth ride, ample cargo space, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes include its somewhat bland styling and potential for certain age-related maintenance issues.
