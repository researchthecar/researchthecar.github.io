The 2006 Toyota Sienna is a popular minivan known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine options: a 3.3L V6 producing 215 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 that offered increased performance with 266 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, which was introduced mid-year. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sienna's practicality and dependability, but some common complaints include issues with the sliding doors, excessive oil consumption (primarily with the 3.3L engine), and certain electrical problems.

**Summary**

The 2006 Toyota Sienna is generally a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around excessive oil consumption in the 3.3L V6 and sliding door malfunctions, which can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical problems are also fairly common. While the Sienna has a good reputation, inspecting the vehicle for these potential issues before purchasing can help avoid unexpected expenses. The severity and cost of the issues range from relatively minor interior trim problems to more expensive engine and transmission repairs, so careful inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
