The 2023 Toyota Sienna is a popular minivan known for its fuel efficiency due to its hybrid powertrain. It comes standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 245 horsepower. It only comes with an eCVT transmission. Owners often praise its spacious interior, smooth ride, and Toyota's reputation for reliability. Common complaints include the continuously variable transmission's (CVT) characteristic drone under hard acceleration and some dislike the limited availability of certain features on lower trim levels.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Hybrid**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported engine misfires, particularly during cold starts or under heavy load. This can manifest as rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the spark plugs, ignition coils, and fuel injectors. Replacing faulty components can resolve the issue. In some cases, a software update to the engine control unit (ECU) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the failed components and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature degradation of the hybrid battery can result in reduced fuel economy and decreased electric driving range.
    *   Solution: Requires diagnosis of the hybrid battery pack and individual modules. Replacement of faulty modules or the entire battery pack is the usual fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether individual modules or the entire pack needs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**eCVT**

*   **CVT "Drone" Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners complain about the characteristic high-revving noise from the eCVT during acceleration. This is inherent to the CVT design but can be perceived as excessive or annoying.
    *   Solution: There is no real fix for this, as it is a characteristic of the eCVT. Some owners have reported that sound deadening material helps to reduce the noise level in the cabin.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the rear suspension sags, especially when the vehicle is loaded with passengers or cargo. This can lead to a reduced ride height and potentially affect handling.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the rear springs and shocks/struts is necessary. Replacement of worn or weak components is the standard fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. If not, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sliding Door Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors may fail to open or close properly, or may exhibit erratic behavior.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the door sensors, motor, and control module. Repair or replacement of faulty components is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic tailgate sometimes fails to open or close.
    *   Solution: The liftgate actuator and sensor could be failing. Replacing them would fix the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling noises coming from various areas of the interior, such as the dashboard, doors, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: This often requires identifying the source of the rattle and using sound-deadening materials or tightening loose components to eliminate the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the source and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Third-Row Seat Folding Difficulties**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty folding or unfolding the third-row seats, sometimes due to a jammed mechanism.
    * Solution: Inspection and lubrication of the folding mechanism, or repair/replacement of damaged components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Toyota Sienna generally exhibits reliable performance, but some owners have reported issues related to the hybrid powertrain, infotainment system, and interior components. Engine misfires and hybrid battery degradation, while less frequent, can be costly to repair. The eCVT "drone" is inherent to the design and not necessarily a defect. Interior rattles and power sliding door issues are relatively common and can be frustrating for owners. The most expensive potential repairs are related to the hybrid system and infotainment system replacement.
