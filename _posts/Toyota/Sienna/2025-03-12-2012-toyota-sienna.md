The 2012 Toyota Sienna is a popular minivan known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Available with either a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine (187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque) or a 3.5-liter V6 engine (266 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque), both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

However, some common complaints include issues with certain electrical components, sliding door malfunctions, and occasional engine-related problems, depending on the engine choice.

**Summary**

The 2012 Toyota Sienna is a generally reliable minivan but can suffer from some issues, particularly with the electrical components like the sliding doors. Engine issues, such as water pump failures in the V6, and excessive oil consumption in the four-cylinder, are also potential concerns. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can be costly to address. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds or engine repairs, can be quite costly. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, as well as budget for potential maintenance and repairs.
