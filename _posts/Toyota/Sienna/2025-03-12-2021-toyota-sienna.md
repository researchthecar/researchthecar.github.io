The 2021 Toyota Sienna marked a significant redesign for the popular minivan, moving exclusively to a hybrid powertrain. This powertrain consists of a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with electric motors, producing a combined 245 horsepower. It uses an Electronically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). Many owners appreciate the Sienna's excellent fuel economy, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Common complaints often revolve around the hybrid system's occasionally noticeable transitions, the infotainment system's complexity, and some interior material choices.
