The 2015 Toyota Prius C is a subcompact hybrid hatchback known for its excellent fuel economy, ease of parking, and maneuverability in urban environments. It is powered by a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system, producing a combined 99 horsepower and 82 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate its compact size, impressive MPG, and reliability. Common dislikes include its lack of power, basic interior features, and somewhat noisy engine under hard acceleration. The 2015 Prius C is only available with the 1.5L engine and Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive CVT transmission.
