**Hybrid Battery**

* **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: The hybrid battery capacity degrades over time, leading to reduced fuel economy and shorter all-electric driving range. In severe cases, the car may not start or may display hybrid system error messages.
    * Solution: Replacing or reconditioning the hybrid battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ for replacement, $1,000 - $2,000 for reconditioning (if available).

**Summary**

The 2018 Toyota Prius C generally experiences fewer major issues compared to some other vehicles, but owners have reported problems with the hybrid inverter and battery, CVT, and electrical components such as headlights and the navigation system.
