**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4 (1NZ-FXE) Hybrid**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the 1.5L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, a burning oil smell, and visible blue smoke from the exhaust pipe.
    * Solution: The most common solution involves replacing the piston rings. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The water pump, responsible for circulating coolant through the engine, can fail prematurely. Symptoms include engine overheating, coolant leaks, and a whining noise coming from the engine bay.
    * Solution: Replacement of the water pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ECVT (Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **No Issues Found**

**Hybrid System**

* **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The hybrid battery pack can degrade over time, leading to reduced fuel economy, decreased acceleration, and eventually a warning light on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on whether a new or refurbished battery is used)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear shock absorbers can wear out prematurely, leading to a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and increased stopping distances.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Combination Meter (Instrument Cluster) Failure**

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor, which circulates air through the vents, can fail, resulting in no air blowing from the vents, even when the fan is turned on. It could also create a loud squealing noise.
    * Solution: Replacement of the HVAC blower motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Toyota Prius C is generally a reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues. The most significant potential problems involve the hybrid battery and excessive oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. The other issues, such as water pump failure, shock absorber wear, instrument cluster failure, and HVAC blower motor failure are less severe but should be considered during inspection and maintenance. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
