The 2017 Toyota Prius C is a subcompact hybrid hatchback known for its excellent fuel economy, making it a popular choice for city driving and environmentally conscious consumers. The Prius C is only available with a 1.5L 4-cylinder engine (73 hp and 82 lb-ft of torque) paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate its affordability, maneuverability, and low running costs. However, some common complaints include the small size (limited cargo space), relatively slow acceleration, and a somewhat basic interior.
