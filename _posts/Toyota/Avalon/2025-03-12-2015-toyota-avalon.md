The 2015 Toyota Avalon is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reputation for reliability. Available engine options include a 3.5L V6 engine producing 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid powertrain featuring a 2.5L 4-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor. Both powertrains are connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Avalon for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and strong fuel economy (especially with the hybrid). Common criticisms include the somewhat bland styling and less engaging driving experience compared to some competitors.

**Summary:**

The 2015 Toyota Avalon is a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with the 3.5L V6 engine, particularly oil leaks from the timing cover and water pump failure. Harsh shifting from the 6-speed automatic transmission is another fairly common complaint. Electrical issues, such as infotainment system problems and battery drain, can also occur. Suspension issues are fairly rare. Overall, while these issues can be frustrating, they are not necessarily widespread, and the Avalon maintains a good reputation for dependability. The most expensive potential repairs include engine resealing or transmission replacement, while other issues are typically less costly to address.
