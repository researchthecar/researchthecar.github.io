The 2018 Toyota Avalon is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. Most 2018 Avalons came equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid version was also available, featuring a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 200 horsepower, and an eCVT transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Avalon's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample passenger space. However, some common complaints include the infotainment system's interface and the somewhat uninspired driving dynamics.
