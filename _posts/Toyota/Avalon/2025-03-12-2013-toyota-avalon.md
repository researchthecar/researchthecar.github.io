The 2013 Toyota Avalon marked the start of its fourth generation, offering a more stylish and engaging driving experience compared to previous iterations. It was available with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Avalon's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and Toyota's reputation for reliability.
