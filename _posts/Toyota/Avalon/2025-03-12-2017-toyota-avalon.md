The 2017 Toyota Avalon is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and reputation for reliability. The standard engine is a 3.5-liter V6 producing 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid version was also available. Owners appreciate the Avalon's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample rear legroom. Common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's dated interface and some styling elements.
