The 2021 Toyota Avalon is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. Engine options include a 3.5L V6 producing 301 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L inline-4 hybrid producing 215 net horsepower. The V6 is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid uses a CVT. Owners generally appreciate the Avalon's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and fuel efficiency (especially with the hybrid). Some common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling and less-than-sporty handling compared to some competitors.
