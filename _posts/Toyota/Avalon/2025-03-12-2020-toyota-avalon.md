The 2020 Toyota Avalon is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reputation for reliability. It offers a blend of luxury and practicality. The standard engine is a 3.5-liter V6 producing 301 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid powertrain is also available, combining a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor. Owners often praise the Avalon's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and user-friendly technology.
