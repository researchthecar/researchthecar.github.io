**Introduction**

The 2010 Toyota Avalon is a full-size sedan that offers a comfortable and reliable ride. It is available with two engine options: a 3.5-liter V6 and a 2.5-liter inline-four. The V6 engine produces 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, while the inline-four produces 169 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. People like the Avalon for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and impressive fuel economy. However, some people have experienced issues with the vehicle's engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and interior.

**Engine**

**3.5-liter V6**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak. This can lead to a loss of power, increased fuel consumption, and a rough idle. The problem is fixed by replacing the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400.
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to skip. This can lead to catastrophic engine damage. The problem is fixed by replacing the timing chain tensioner. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000.
* **VVT-i system failure:** The VVT-i system can fail, causing a loss of power and a rough idle. The problem is fixed by replacing the VVT-i solenoid. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400.

**Transmission**

**Six-speed automatic transmission**

* **Shift solenoids failure:** The shift solenoids can fail, causing the transmission to shift poorly. This can lead to a loss of power, delayed shifts, and a rough ride. The problem is fixed by replacing the shift solenoids. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $800.
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing the transmission to slip. This can lead to a loss of power, a rough ride, and a burning smell. The problem is fixed by replacing the torque converter. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000.

**Suspension**

* **Strut mounts failure:** The strut mounts can fail, causing the suspension to make a knocking noise. This can lead to a rough ride and premature tire wear. The problem is fixed by replacing the strut mounts. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400.
* **Sway bar links failure:** The sway bar links can fail, causing the suspension to make a clunking noise. This can lead to a rough ride and reduced stability. The problem is fixed by replacing the sway bar links. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to drain and the vehicle to stall. The problem is fixed by replacing the alternator. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $800.
* **Starter failure:** The starter can fail, preventing the engine from starting. The problem is fixed by replacing the starter. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400.
* **Battery failure:** The battery can fail, causing the vehicle to lose power and stall. The problem is fixed by replacing the battery. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200.

**Exterior**

* **Headlight condensation:** The headlights can experience condensation, which can reduce visibility. The problem is fixed by replacing the headlights. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400.

**Interior**

* **Climate control panel failure:** The climate control panel can fail, causing the air conditioning and heating system to stop working. The problem is fixed by replacing the climate control panel. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $800.
* **Power window failure:** The power windows can fail, preventing the windows from rolling up or down. The problem is fixed by replacing the window motors or switches. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400.
