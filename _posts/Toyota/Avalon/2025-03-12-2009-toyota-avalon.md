**Summary**

The 2009 Toyota Avalon, while generally reliable, can experience several common issues. The most prevalent relate to oil leaks from the engine, potentially requiring valve cover gasket or timing cover replacements. The transmission can suffer from torque converter problems, leading to shuddering. Suspension components like struts and sway bar links wear over time, impacting ride quality. Electrical issues can arise with the navigation system and power door locks. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, engine and transmission work can be costly. Owners should be aware of these potential problems and perform regular maintenance to minimize the risk of major repairs.
