**Introduction:**

The 2019 Toyota Avalon is a full-size sedan that offers a premium driving experience. It is available with three engine and transmission options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with an 8-speed automatic transmission, a 3.5-liter V6 with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and a 2.5-liter four-cylinder hybrid with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Avalon is praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and impressive safety features. However, it has also received some complaints regarding certain components.

**Engine**

**2.5-liter Four-Cylinder**

* **Misfiring:** Engine misfires can occur due to a faulty ignition coil or spark plug. Symptoms include rough idle, hesitation during acceleration, and reduced fuel efficiency. The issue can be resolved by replacing the affected coil or spark plug. **Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $500+**

**3.5-liter V6**

* **Oil Consumption:** Some V6 engines have experienced excessive oil consumption, leading to blue smoke from the exhaust and low oil levels. The problem can be traced to worn piston rings or valve seals. Replacing the affected components is necessary to address the issue. **Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $3,000+**

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Problems:** In some cases, the 8-speed automatic transmission may experience rough or delayed shifts. This can be caused by a faulty transmission control module (TCM) or solenoid. Replacing the TCM or solenoid can resolve the problem. **Estimated cost to fix: $800 - $1,500+**

**CVT**

* **Belt Slipping:** The CVT's belt may slip under heavy acceleration or high loads, resulting in reduced power and a whining noise. Replacing the belt and pulleys is typically required. **Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $3,000+**

**Suspension**

* **Strut Noise:** Some Avalons may experience noise from the front struts during driving over bumps or rough roads. The issue is often caused by worn strut mounts. Replacing the strut mounts can eliminate the noise. **Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $800+**

**Electrical**

* **Battery Discharge:** In some cases, the battery may discharge prematurely due to a faulty alternator or parasitic drain. The issue can be resolved by replacing the alternator or identifying and addressing the parasitic drain. **Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+**

* **Electrical System Failure:** Some Avalons have experienced electrical system failures due to a faulty power control module (PCM). Symptoms may include intermittent power loss, engine stalling, and dashboard warning lights. Replacing the PCM can address the issue. **Estimated cost to fix: $1,200 - $1,800+**

**Exterior**

* **Door Lock Malfunction:** Some Avalons may have issues with the power door locks not functioning correctly. The problem can be traced to faulty door lock actuators. Replacing the affected actuators can restore proper door lock operation. **Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+**

* **Headlight Condensation:** Some Avalons have experienced condensation buildup inside the headlights, which can impair visibility. The issue can be resolved by sealing any gaps or leaks in the headlight assembly. **Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+**

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Problems:** Some Avalons have reported issues with the climate control system. Symptoms may include uneven heating or cooling, fan noise, or inoperative buttons. The problem can be traced to faulty climate control modules or actuators. Replacing the affected components can restore proper climate control operation. **Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $1,000+**

* **Dashboard Rattle:** Some Avalons may experience a rattling noise from the dashboard, particularly during driving over rough roads. The issue is often caused by loose components within the dashboard assembly. Tightening or replacing the loose components can eliminate the rattle. **Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $500+**

**Summary:**

The 2019 Toyota Avalon is a well-regarded vehicle but has faced some issues with certain components. The engine and transmission problems include misfiring, excessive oil consumption, shifting problems, and belt slipping. The suspension can experience strut noise, while the electrical system may suffer from battery discharge or failures. Exterior issues include door lock malfunctions and headlight condensation. Interior concerns center around climate control problems and dashboard rattles. The severity and cost of the issues vary depending on the affected component and the extent of the damage.
