The 2001 Toyota Avalon is a full-size sedan known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. It was available with only one engine option: a 3.0L 1MZ-FE V6 engine producing 217 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Avalon's smooth ride, comfortable seats, and Toyota's reputation for reliability. Common complaints include somewhat bland styling and a suspension that prioritizes comfort over sporty handling.
