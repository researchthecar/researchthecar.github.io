The 2016 Toyota Avalon is known for its luxurious interior, smooth ride, and spacious cabin. It is available with two engine options: a 3.5L V6 that produces 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5L V6 hybrid that produces 200 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

Despite its overall reliability, some owners have reported specific issues with the 2016 Toyota Avalon. Here's a comprehensive list of the known problems:

**Engine**
