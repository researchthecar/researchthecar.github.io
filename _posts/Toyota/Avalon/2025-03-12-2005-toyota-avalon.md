The 2005 Toyota Avalon is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reputation for reliability. The sole engine option for this model year is a 3.5L 2GR-FE V6 engine that produced 280 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. It was exclusively paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Avalon's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample passenger space. Some common complaints revolve around the somewhat bland styling and occasional issues with certain electronic components, though overall, it's considered a dependable vehicle.
