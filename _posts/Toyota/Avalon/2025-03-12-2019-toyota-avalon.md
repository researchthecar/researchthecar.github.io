The 2019 Toyota Avalon marked the beginning of the fifth generation of this full-size sedan. It offered a more stylish and dynamic design compared to previous generations, while retaining Toyota's reputation for reliability. Engine options included a 3.5L V6 producing 301 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and a hybrid powertrain combining a 2.5L inline-4 engine with an electric motor, producing a total system output of 215 horsepower, paired with an eCVT. Owners generally appreciate the Avalon's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong fuel economy (especially the hybrid). Some criticisms include the somewhat uninspired handling and the infotainment system's dated design.
