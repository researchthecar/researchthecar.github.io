The 2021 Toyota Camry is a popular mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. The standard engine is a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. A 3.5-liter V6 engine, producing 301 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, is available on higher trim levels, also paired with the 8-speed automatic. There is also a hybrid option. Owners appreciate the Camry's dependability, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. Common criticisms include its somewhat bland styling (depending on trim) and less engaging driving dynamics compared to some competitors.
