The 2017 Toyota Camry is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine options: a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 178 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 generating 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Camry for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and reputation for longevity. Common dislikes include its somewhat bland styling and uninspired handling compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights, the need to add oil more frequently than expected, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. In severe cases, a dealer may perform an oil consumption test to determine the extent of the problem. Depending on the results, the fix could range from replacing valve stem seals to replacing piston rings, or even engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience a shudder or vibration, particularly at low speeds or during light acceleration, caused by the torque converter not locking up properly.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush *might* alleviate the issue, but more commonly a replacement torque converter is required. In some cases, the entire transmission may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $4000+

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven road surfaces.

**Summary**

The 2017 Toyota Camry is generally a reliable vehicle. However, some owners have reported issues such as excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, torque converter shudder with the 6-speed automatic transmission, and problems with the backup camera and Entune infotainment system. The severity of these issues varies, but repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to more costly engine or transmission work. While dashboard cracking is rare, it can be an expensive repair. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used Camry before purchase.
