The 2012 Toyota Camry marked a significant redesign for the popular mid-size sedan. It was offered with a 2.5L inline-4 engine producing 178 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L V6 producing 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid variant using a 2.5L inline-4 with an electric motor. The Camry is generally praised for its reliability, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency. However, some owners have reported issues with specific components. Criticisms often revolve around the somewhat bland styling and driving dynamics.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2012 Camry owners, particularly those with the 2.5L engine, have reported excessive oil consumption. This can manifest as the need to add oil frequently between scheduled oil changes. It often leads to engine knocking or potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Toyota issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) for this issue. A revised piston and piston ring design may be necessary to correct the issue, but the dealer usually performs an oil consumption test before authorizing the work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+ (if engine rebuild or replacement is required).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump may fail prematurely, causing overheating. Signs include coolant leaks near the water pump area, a whining noise from the engine, and the temperature gauge rising into the red zone.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump.

**Summary**

The 2012 Toyota Camry generally holds up well, but potential buyers should be aware of specific issues. The most concerning is the excessive oil consumption issue affecting some 2.5L engine models, which can be costly to repair. Other common complaints include Entune system glitches and, in some cases, dashboard cracking. Overall, while these issues exist, the Camry remains a reliable choice, especially if a thorough inspection is performed before purchase. The cost of repairs can range from minor fixes to significant engine work, so understanding these potential problems is crucial.
