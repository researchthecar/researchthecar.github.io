### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Toyota Camry stands out as a highly reliable vehicle, especially when equipped with the V6 engines. The 4-cylinder engine, while generally dependable, has a known tendency for oil consumption and potential timing chain issues that require attention. Electrical components like alternators and power window motors can occasionally fail, and exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling are not uncommon due to age. However, these are often manageable and do not detract significantly from the Camry's overall reputation for durability. For buyers seeking a dependable used sedan, the 2004 Camry remains a solid choice, provided it has been reasonably maintained.
