The 2007 Toyota Camry is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. Available engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing around 158 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 engine which produced around 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Camry for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reputation for longevity. Common criticisms include a somewhat bland driving experience and less-than-exciting styling.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2007 Camry owners with the 2.4L engine have reported excessive oil consumption. This can manifest as needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, seeing blue smoke from the exhaust, and potentially engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: A potential fix involves replacing the piston rings with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **VVT-i Oil Hose Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: A rubber oil hose for the Variable Valve Timing-intelligent (VVT-i) system may crack and leak oil.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rubber hose with an updated metal one.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

**5-Speed Automatic (U250E - Used with 2.4L Inline-4)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between gears. This can feel like a noticeable "jolt" when the transmission shifts.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and fluid change may help in some cases. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 for fluid change, $500-$1500+ for valve body repair/replacement, $2,500-$4,000+ for a full rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (U660E - Used with 3.5L V6)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or clunking noises coming from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This is often due to worn strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per pair (front or rear).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**

    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200+ for drain clearing, $100 - $500+ for weather stripping replacement (depending on location and extent of damage).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or splitting of the dashboard material, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ for dashboard replacement, $50 - $200 for a dashboard cover.

**Summary**

The 2007 Toyota Camry is generally a reliable vehicle, but some common issues exist. The most concerning are potential oil consumption problems with the 2.4L engine, which can be costly to repair, as well as the potential harsh shifting issues with the transmissions. Other issues such as suspension noises, electrical failures, and water leaks are less severe but can still be frustrating for owners. Overall, carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these issues before purchasing and be prepared for potential repair costs if these problems arise.
