The 2018 Toyota Camry marked the first year of its eighth generation, a significant redesign praised for its improved styling, handling, and technology. Available engine options included a 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 delivering 301 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the Camry's reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride, some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, excessive road noise, and certain engine/transmission quirks.
