The 2006 Toyota Camry is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. Available engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 154 hp and 160 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 making 210 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Camry for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reputation for longevity. Common complaints include uninspired styling, a somewhat bland driving experience, and reports of excessive oil consumption in some engines.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported high oil consumption, sometimes requiring the engine to be topped off frequently between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Toyota issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) addressing this issue. The recommended fix often involves replacing the piston rings and potentially the pistons themselves. In severe cases, the entire engine may need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ for engine rebuild or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are observed from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets and timing cover. The smell of burning oil may be present.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals. Ensure proper torque during reassembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the location of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between certain gears. Slipping may also occur, where the engine revs without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    * Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required, potentially involving valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 for fluid flush; $2,000 - $4,000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. The vehicle may also feel unstable or wander.
    * Solution: Replace the strut mounts. It's often recommended to replace the struts and shocks at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle.
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Recalls: None Found

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appear on the dashboard surface, often around the airbag cover or in other areas exposed to sunlight.
    * Solution: While there's no perfect solution, some owners use dashboard covers or replace the entire dashboard, which is expensive.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 for a cover; $800-$1500+ for dashboard replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Interior**

* **Sticky Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: The dashboard becomes sticky or tacky to the touch, especially in hot weather.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20-$50 for cleaners/protectants; $50+ for dashboard cover.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Toyota Camry, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The most significant concern is the excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L inline-4 engine, which can lead to expensive repairs. Other problems, such as transmission issues, strut mount failure, and electrical faults, are less frequent but can still be costly to address. The sticky dashboard is primarily an aesthetic problem. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. Getting a pre-purchase inspection is recommended.
