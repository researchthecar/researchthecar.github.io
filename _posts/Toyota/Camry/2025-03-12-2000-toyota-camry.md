The 2000 Toyota Camry is a popular mid-size sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. It came with two engine options: a 2.2L 4-cylinder engine producing 136 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine producing 194 horsepower and 209 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Camry for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong reputation for longevity.
