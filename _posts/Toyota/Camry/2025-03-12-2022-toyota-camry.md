The 2022 Toyota Camry is a popular mid-size sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. It offers a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and a reputation for longevity. However, like any vehicle, it's not without its potential issues. The 2022 Camry is available with a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine producing 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, or a 3.5-liter V6 engine. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While owners often praise the Camry's dependability and resale value, some criticisms include its somewhat bland styling and uninspiring driving dynamics.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure warning light illuminating, the engine running rough, or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: In some cases, the issue has been traced to faulty piston rings. The recommended solution involves replacing the piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can occur, leading to rough idling, decreased acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the root cause is crucial and can involve replacing spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted experiencing rough or jerky shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like a slight "clunk" or hesitation during acceleration or deceleration.
    * Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hesitation When Accelerating**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have also reported a delay or hesitation when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This can make it difficult to merge onto highways or navigate through traffic.
    * Solution: The issue can sometimes be resolved with a transmission fluid flush and refill. In more serious cases, it may require replacing the torque converter or other internal transmission components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $1,500+ (torque converter replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may involve the screen going black, buttons not working, or the system rebooting unexpectedly.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the source and complexity of the repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

While the 2022 Toyota Camry generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, some owners have reported issues ranging from minor inconveniences to more serious mechanical problems. The most notable concerns revolve around excessive oil consumption with the 2.5L engine and rough shifting with the 8-speed automatic transmission. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system have also been reported. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the necessary solution, from a relatively inexpensive software update to potentially thousands of dollars for engine or transmission work.
