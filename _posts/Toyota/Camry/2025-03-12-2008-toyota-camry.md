The 2008 Toyota Camry is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Camry for its dependability and low running costs, but some dislike its bland styling and somewhat uninspired driving dynamics.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some 2.4L engines experienced excessive oil consumption. This could manifest as needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potentially engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    * Solution: In some cases, Toyota issued a technical service bulletin and extended warranty coverage for piston ring replacement to address this issue. Replacing the piston rings is the most common solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the shop and extent of engine damage
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

* **Oil Leak from VVTi Oil Line**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rubber VVTi oil line can rupture or leak causing oil to spray onto the exhaust manifold causing a burning oil smell and potential fire hazard.
    * Solution: Replace the rubber hose with an updated metal VVTi oil line
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Applies to both 2.4L and 3.5L)**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush *may* sometimes improve shifting. In other cases, valve body issues or solenoid failures require repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush; $500 - $1500+ for valve body or solenoid repair
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and tear of the factory struts and shocks. This can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn struts and/or shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ depending on parts and labor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working, often with a clicking sound coming from the door. This is often due to a failed window regulator.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Clock Spring Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The clock spring can fail, resulting in the airbag light illuminating, and potentially loss of steering wheel-mounted controls (horn, audio, cruise control).
    * Solution: Replacement of the clock spring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracking of the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is the only permanent fix, but is very expensive. Some owners opt for dashboard covers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000+ for dashboard replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Toyota Camry is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine and dashboard cracking. Suspension components and electrical issues like window regulators and clock springs can also arise. While some repairs, such as replacing a window regulator, are relatively inexpensive, others, like addressing excessive oil consumption or dashboard replacement, can be costly. Overall, the 2008 Camry remains a solid choice for a used car, but a thorough inspection is recommended before purchase to identify and address any potential problems.
