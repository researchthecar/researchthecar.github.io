The 2003 Toyota Camry is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine producing approximately 157 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine outputting around 192 horsepower and 209 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 4-speed automatic for both engines and a 5-speed manual transmission for the 4-cylinder engine. Owners generally praised the Camry for its dependability and longevity, while some criticisms included its somewhat bland styling and driving experience.

**Engine**

**2.4L 2AZ-FE I4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Burning oil at a higher-than-normal rate, often exceeding 1 quart every 1,000 miles. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and spark plug fouling. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: The most effective solution involves replacing the piston rings with an updated design to improve oil sealing. Other potential fixes include addressing PCV valve issues or cylinder head problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ (depending on the extent of the repair and shop rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L 1MZ-FE V6**
* No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**A245E 4-Speed Automatic**
*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or jerking during gear changes, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear. The transmission may also exhibit slipping or erratic shifting behavior.
    *   Solution: Replacing the automatic transmission fluid can sometimes alleviate minor issues. However, more severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) to $1,500 - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Aisin A150 5-Speed Manual**
* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Creaking or popping noises coming from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Visible wear or damage to the strut mounts can also be observed. This can lead to poor handling and increased tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn or damaged strut mounts. It is often recommended to replace the struts themselves at the same time, as they may also be nearing the end of their lifespan.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ (for strut mount and strut replacement on both sides)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows rolling up and down slowly, erratically, or not at all. A grinding or clicking noise may also be heard when attempting to operate the power windows.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, poor fuel economy, rough idling, and potential failure to pass emissions tests. Diagnostic codes related to oxygen sensor malfunction will be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor. It is often recommended to replace oxygen sensors in pairs (especially the upstream sensors) to ensure optimal performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per sensor (depending on location and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches/Rocker Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the lower portions of the rear wheel arches and rocker panels. This is particularly prevalent in areas with harsh winters and road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, involving removing the rust, patching any holes, and repainting the affected areas. The extent of the repair will depend on the severity of the rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per side (depending on severity and shop rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in sun-exposed areas. This is often due to the plastic material drying out and becoming brittle over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200+ (dashboard cover) to $1,000+ (dashboard replacement, depending on labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Toyota Camry is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it can experience certain issues. The most significant concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L 4-cylinder engine, which can be costly to repair. Other common issues, such as transmission problems, suspension wear, and electrical faults, are typically less expensive to address. Rust can also be a factor, especially in regions with road salt. Overall, while the 2003 Camry is known for its longevity, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
