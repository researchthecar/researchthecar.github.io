The 2010 Toyota Camry is a popular mid-size sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 169 hp and 167 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 268 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Camry for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong resale value. Common criticisms include a somewhat bland driving experience and uninspired styling.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2010 Camry owners with the 2.5L engine have reported excessive oil consumption, sometimes requiring a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored and addressed. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating, engine knocking or ticking, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Toyota issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) regarding this issue. The fix often involves replacing the piston rings with an updated design and potentially cleaning the carbon buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and the shop performing the work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VVTi Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Variable Valve Timing intelligent (VVTi) actuator can fail, causing a rough idle, reduced performance, and a check engine light. This is more prevalent in higher mileage vehicles.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty VVTi actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of oil leaks originating from the valve cover gaskets, timing cover, or oil pan. These leaks can be gradual but should be addressed to prevent engine damage or low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or resealing the affected area.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1000 depending on the location of the leak and the extent of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between gears. Slipping during acceleration can also occur. This is most common in higher mileage vehicles.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush can resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) to $3,000+ (rebuild or replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn struts and shocks can lead to a bouncy or unstable ride, reduced handling, and increased stopping distances. Noises such as clunking or rattling over bumps can also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ depending on the number of components replaced and the shop performing the work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory navigation system (if equipped) can experience various issues, including screen freezing, inaccurate GPS data, and failure to boot up.
    *   Solution: Software updates or replacement of the navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the fix and whether the unit can be repaired or needs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows can fail to operate, often due to a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks, particularly in hot climates. This is largely a cosmetic issue.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$1500+ depending on the shop performing the replacement and the source of the dashboard.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2010 Toyota Camry is a generally reliable vehicle. The most significant potential issue is excessive oil consumption with the 2.5L engine, which can lead to costly repairs. Other common problems such as harsh shifting, navigation system failures, suspension issues, and dashboard cracking are generally less severe but still worth noting when considering a purchase. Overall, the Camry remains a solid choice, but a thorough inspection and maintenance history review are recommended, especially concerning oil consumption and transmission performance.
