The 2005 Toyota Camry is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability and practicality. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 154 hp and 160 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 producing 210 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically praise the Camry for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency, and low running costs. Common complaints center around its somewhat bland styling and handling characteristics, as well as some specific component failures that arise with age.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 (2AZ-FE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, often more than 1 quart every 1,000 miles. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust. Can lead to engine damage if oil levels are not monitored and maintained.
    *   Solution: Toyota issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) for this issue. Updated piston rings are recommended. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket. This can lead to a burning smell and oil drips on the exhaust manifold.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6 (3MZ-FE)**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket. This can lead to a burning smell and oil drips on the exhaust manifold.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (U250E)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between certain gears. Slipping can also occur, where the engine revs up but the car doesn't accelerate properly.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can resolve the issue. In other cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noises (clunking, squeaking) from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. The vehicle may also exhibit poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts. Replacing the struts themselves at the same time is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 (for both strut mounts and struts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows stop working or operate intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminates. Can lead to reduced fuel economy and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust develops on the lower body panels, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust repair and body work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks develop on the dashboard surface, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Toyota Camry is generally a reliable vehicle, but some common issues can arise as it ages. The most significant and potentially costly issues are related to excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine and potential transmission problems. Other common problems include valve cover gasket leaks, suspension wear, and electrical component failures. Rust on the exterior and dashboard cracks are also frequent complaints. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission work, can be quite costly.
