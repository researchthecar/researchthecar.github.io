The 2011 Toyota Camry is a popular mid-size sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. This model year came with a few engine and transmission options: a 2.5L inline-4 (2AR-FE) producing 169 hp and 167 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 (2GR-FE) producing 268 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque, both typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Camry for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and dependability. Criticisms typically center on its somewhat bland styling and uninspired driving experience.

Electrical problems like radio issues and power window failures, and dashboard cracking can also occur. The severity and cost of these repairs can vary, but addressing these issues early can prevent more significant problems down the road. The oil consumption issue is potentially the most severe, with costs ranging up to engine replacement.
