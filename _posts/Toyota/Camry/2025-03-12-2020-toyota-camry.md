The 2020 Toyota Camry is a popular mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. It offers a blend of practicality and style that appeals to a wide range of drivers. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. The 2020 Camry comes with several engine options, including a 2.5L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 203 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L V6 producing 301 hp and 267 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid powertrain with a 2.5L inline-4 paired with an electric motor. All non-hybrid engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Common praises for the Camry often cite its dependability and smooth ride, while criticisms frequently revolve around its somewhat bland styling and less engaging driving experience compared to some competitors.
