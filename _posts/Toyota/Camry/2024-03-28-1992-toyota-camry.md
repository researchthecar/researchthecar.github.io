    * **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt is a critical component that synchronizes the movement of the crankshaft and camshaft. If the timing belt fails, it can cause catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a sudden loss of power, a rattling noise from the engine, and difficulty starting. The fix involves replacing the timing belt and any other damaged components. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+
* **3.0L V6**
    * **Head gasket failure:** The head gasket is a seal that prevents coolant and oil from leaking between the engine block and cylinder heads. If the head gasket fails, it can cause a variety of problems, including overheating, coolant leaks, and oil leaks. The fix involves replacing the head gasket and resurfacing the cylinder heads. Estimated cost: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket is a seal that prevents air from leaking into the engine. If the intake manifold gasket fails, it can cause a variety of problems, including a loss of power, rough idling, and increased emissions. The fix involves replacing the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost: $200 - $500+

**Transmission**

* **4-speed automatic (A140L)**
    * **Slipping:** The transmission may slip out of gear when shifting, causing a loss of power. Symptoms include a delayed or rough shift, a whining noise from the transmission, and difficulty accelerating. The fix involves replacing the transmission fluid, filter, and other internal components as needed. Estimated cost: $500 - $2,000+
    * **No reverse:** The transmission may not engage in reverse gear, making it impossible to move the vehicle backward. Symptoms include a lack of response when shifting into reverse, a grinding noise from the transmission, and a check engine light. The fix involves replacing the reverse gear assembly or other internal components as needed. Estimated cost: $500 - $2,000+
* **5-speed manual (S51)**
    * **Grinding gears:** The transmission may grind gears when shifting, making it difficult to engage the desired gear. Symptoms include a grinding or crunching noise when shifting, difficulty getting the vehicle into gear, and a check engine light. The fix involves replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, or other internal components as needed. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,500+
