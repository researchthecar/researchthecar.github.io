The 2004 Toyota Camry is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 157 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque and a 3.3L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Camry for its dependability and practicality, but some criticized its somewhat bland styling and driving dynamics.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored and addressed.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions include replacing piston rings, valve stem seals, or in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light - P0420 Code (Catalytic Converter Efficiency Below Threshold)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and a diagnostic scan reveals a P0420 code, indicating the catalytic converter is not functioning efficiently. This can manifest as decreased fuel economy or reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter. Before replacing the catalytic converter, other parts such as the O2 sensors, exhaust manifold gasket, or other exhaust leaks should be checked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often from valve cover gaskets or the front crankshaft seal. Visible oil spots under the car and a burning oil smell are common indicators.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse. Harsh shifts between gears are also reported.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Worn strut mounts can also affect handling and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts. It's typically recommended to replace struts at the same time.

**Summary**

The 2004 Toyota Camry is generally a reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues. The most significant concern is excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine, which can be costly to fix. Other issues, such as transmission problems, suspension wear, and electrical issues, are fairly common for a vehicle of this age and mileage. While the severity of these issues varies, potential buyers should be aware of them and factor in potential repair costs when considering a 2004 Camry.
