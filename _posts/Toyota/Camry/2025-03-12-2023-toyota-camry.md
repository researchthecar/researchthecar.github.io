The 2023 Toyota Camry is a popular mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. It's available with two engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 301 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often praise the Camry for its smooth ride, spacious interior, and comprehensive suite of safety features. Criticisms tend to focus on its somewhat uninspired styling and less engaging driving dynamics compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.5L Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. The issue is usually noticed after a certain mileage is reached.
    *   Solution: There is no widespread, guaranteed fix. Monitoring oil levels closely and using the correct type of oil is important. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (for piston ring replacement, if needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can manifest as jerky acceleration or a noticeable lag when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: A software update for the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, flushing the transmission fluid or replacing valve body may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (software update), $300 - $500 (fluid flush), $800 - $1500 (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise emanating from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven road surfaces. The noise may be more pronounced in colder weather.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn or loose suspension components, such as sway bar links, bushings, or shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the specific component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Inaccurate Fuel Gauge Reading**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced inaccurate fuel gauge readings, where the gauge may display an incorrect fuel level or fluctuate erratically. This can lead to uncertainty about the remaining fuel range.
    *   Solution: The fuel level sending unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Wind Noise from Door Seals**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive wind noise entering the cabin, particularly around the door seals, at highway speeds.
    *   Solution: Adjusting or replacing the door seals may help to mitigate the wind noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Reflection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The light-colored dashboard can cause a significant reflection on the windshield in bright sunlight, obstructing the driver's view.
    *   Solution: Use a dashboard cover or apply a non-reflective film to the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Toyota Camry generally exhibits good reliability, but owners have reported issues across various components. The most significant issues include excessive oil consumption with the 2.5L engine, and harsh shifting with the 8-speed transmission. While the oil consumption issue can be potentially costly to fix, other issues, such as suspension noise and electrical glitches, are generally less severe and less expensive to address. These issues are important for potential buyers to be aware of when considering a 2023 Camry.
