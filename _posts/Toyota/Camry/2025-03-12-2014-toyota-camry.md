The 2014 Toyota Camry is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. Available engine options included a 2.5L inline-4 (178 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.5L V6. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Camry's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong resale value. Common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling and less engaging driving experience compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2014 Toyota Camry is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some common issues. The most concerning is excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine and cracks forming on the dashboard, which can be relatively expensive to fix. Other issues like transmission harsh shifting, suspension noises, and electrical problems are generally less severe and less costly to address. Owners should be aware of these potential problems and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing.
