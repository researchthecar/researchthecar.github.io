**Introduction**

The 2006 Toyota Camry is a popular midsize sedan that offers a balance of comfort, reliability, and affordability. It comes with a choice of two engines: a 2.4-liter inline-four or a 3.5-liter V6. The 2.4-liter engine produces 158 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.5-liter V6 generates 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4-liter engine is paired with a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.5-liter V6 comes with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Camry is known for its reliability, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency, but it also has some common issues.

**Engine**

**2.4-liter Inline-Four**

* **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption can occur due to worn piston rings or valve seals. Symptoms include low oil levels and blue or white smoke from the exhaust. The solution involves replacing the affected parts, which can cost $1,500 - $2,500+ (parts and labor)
(Recall Number: 06V080000)
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** A faulty timing chain tensioner can lead to chain noise and premature wear. The solution is to replace the tensioner, which typically costs $800 - $1,200+ (parts and labor)

**3.5-liter V6**

* **VVT-i System Failure:** The Variable Valve Timing with Intelligence (VVT-i) system can experience problems due to faulty sensors or actuators. Symptoms include engine performance issues and warning lights on the dashboard. The solution involves replacing the affected components, which can cost $500 - $1,000+ (parts and labor)

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Failure:** The clutch can wear out prematurely, especially in vehicles with high mileage or frequent use. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, slipping, and chattering. The solution is to replace the clutch assembly, which costs around $700 - $1,200+ (parts and labor)

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slipping:** Transmission slipping can occur due to worn clutches or other internal components. Symptoms include delayed or erratic gear shifts. The solution involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission, which can cost $2,000 - $4,000+ (parts and labor)

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** Malfunctioning shift solenoids can cause shifting problems and warning lights on the dashboard. The solution is to replace the affected solenoid, which costs around $300 - $600+ (parts and labor)

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Bushing Wear:** The rear suspension bushings can wear out over time, causing a rough ride and handling issues. The solution is to replace the bushings, which costs around $200 - $400+ (parts and labor)
* **Strut Failure:** Struts can fail due to worn bearings or damaged seals. Symptoms include noise and vibration when driving. The solution is to replace the struts, which typically costs $600 - $1,000+ (parts and labor)

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can malfunction, causing charging system issues and warning lights on the dashboard. The solution is to replace the alternator, which costs around $300 - $600+ (parts and labor)
* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely due to various electrical issues, such as parasitic draws or faulty components. The solution involves identifying and fixing the underlying cause, which can vary in cost

**Exterior**

* **Rear Bumper Sagging:** The rear bumper can sag due to weak mounting points. The solution is to reinforce the mounting points, which can cost $300 - $500+ (parts and labor)

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking:** The dashboard can develop cracks over time due to exposure to sunlight or temperature changes. The solution is to replace or repair the dashboard, which can cost $500 - $1,000+
* **Door Lock Malfunctions:** The door locks can experience issues such as sticking or difficulty opening. The solution is to replace the affected lock assembly, which costs around $100 - $200+ per door (parts and labor)

**Summary**

The 2006 Toyota Camry is generally a reliable vehicle, but it has some common issues that can be costly to repair. The most severe and expensive issues include engine oil consumption, timing chain tensioner failure, and transmission slipping. The cost of repairs can vary depending on the specific issue, the parts needed, and the labor rates in your area. Regular maintenance and timely repairs can help prevent or minimize these issues, but it's important to be aware of potential problems before purchasing a used 2006 Camry.
