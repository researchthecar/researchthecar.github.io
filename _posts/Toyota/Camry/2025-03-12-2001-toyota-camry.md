The 2001 Toyota Camry is a popular mid-size sedan known for its reliability and practicality. Engine options included a 2.2L 4-cylinder engine producing approximately 136 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L V6 engine producing approximately 192 horsepower and 209 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual on the 4-cylinder. Owners often praise the Camry for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and low maintenance costs. Common complaints include the somewhat bland styling and occasionally lackluster handling.

**Summary**

The 2001 Toyota Camry, while generally reliable, does exhibit some common issues. Engine-related problems such as oil consumption and leaks, as well as potential timing belt failures on the 4-cylinder, are potential concerns. Transmission issues like harsh shifting can also arise. Suspension and electrical issues, while generally less severe, can contribute to overall maintenance costs. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to more costly repairs, and the cost to fix them can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on the issue. Rust is also a consideration, especially in certain climates. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase.
