**Introduction:**

The 2010 Toyota Camry is a midsize sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable interior. It is powered by a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine or a 3.5L V6 engine, paired with either a 6-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Camry is praised for its spacious cabin, intuitive controls, and smooth ride, but it has received some complaints about its uninspired design and lack of performance with the 4-cylinder engine.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4-Cylinder Engine**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks:** Weak intake manifold gaskets can cause coolant or oil leaks. Symptoms include overheating, low coolant levels, or a burning smell. The solution involves replacing the intake manifold gaskets. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
* **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks:** Worn or damaged valve cover gaskets can allow oil to leak out. Symptoms include an oily engine compartment or low oil levels. The solution is to replace the valve cover gaskets. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**3.5L V6 Engine**

Symptoms include reduced engine performance, noisy operation, or overheating. The solution involves flushing the engine and replacing the oil and filter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shift Solenoid Failures:** Faulty shift solenoids can cause harsh or delayed shifting, or even a loss of power. Symptoms include rough gear changes, slipping gears, or a transmission warning light. The solution is to replace the failed shift solenoid(s). Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** Worn or damaged transmission seals or gaskets can allow transmission fluid to leak out. Symptoms include low transmission fluid levels, slipping gears, or a transmission warning light. The solution is to replace the leaking parts and top up the transmission fluid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
