The 2002 Toyota Camry is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability and practicality. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing approximately 157 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 generating around 192 horsepower and 209 lb-ft of torque. People generally appreciate the Camry's comfortable ride, fuel efficiency, and longevity. Common dislikes include somewhat bland styling and unremarkable handling. Both engine options are paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.4L engine in the 2002 Camry is prone to excessive oil consumption. Owners report needing to add oil frequently between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil levels, engine knocking or ticking, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings and valve stem seals can help to mitigate the oil consumption issue. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.0L V6 engine can be susceptible to sludge buildup if oil changes are not performed regularly and with the correct oil type. Symptoms include poor engine performance, rough idling, and potential engine failure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes using synthetic oil can help prevent sludge buildup. An engine flush may help remove existing sludge. In severe cases, engine cleaning or replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission may experience delayed or harsh shifting. This issue could stem from a failing solenoid, low transmission fluid levels, or worn-out clutches.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or dirty, perform a transmission fluid and filter change. If the problem persists, solenoid replacement or a transmission rebuild may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The strut mounts can wear out and fail, leading to clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Worn strut mounts can also affect alignment and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn strut mounts. It is recommended to replace the struts at the same time, as they are likely worn as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working intermittently or completely. This is often caused by a faulty window motor or a broken window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor or window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light (Various Causes)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Check Engine Light may illuminate for a variety of reasons, including issues with the oxygen sensors, catalytic converter, or evaporative emission control system.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic scan is needed to determine the cause of the Check Engine Light. The necessary repairs will depend on the specific trouble code(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $75 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in Areas with Road Salt)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the undercarriage, wheel wells, and body panels, especially in regions where road salt is used.
    *   Solution: Rust repair can range from surface treatment to welding in new metal panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks due to sun exposure and age.
    *   Solution: Use a dashboard cover or replace the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $30 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Toyota Camry, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. The most significant issues tend to be related to engine oil consumption in the 2.4L Inline-4, sludge buildup in the 3.0L V6, and potential transmission problems. Rust and electrical issues, while less critical, are also prevalent. The cost to address these issues can vary significantly, ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work.
