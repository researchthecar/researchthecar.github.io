The 2011 Toyota Avanza is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its affordability and practicality. It's typically powered by a 1.3L or 1.5L inline-4 gasoline engine. The 1.5L engine produces around 103 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options generally include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Avanza's spacious interior for its size and fuel efficiency. Some common dislikes include its basic features and somewhat underpowered engines, especially when fully loaded.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be observed.
    *   Solution: Inspect the piston rings and valve stem seals for wear. Replacement of worn components is necessary to correct the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

*   **Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Unstable engine speed when idling, sometimes accompanied by vibrations or stalling. This can be caused by a dirty throttle body or faulty idle air control valve (if equipped).
    *   Solution: Clean the throttle body, inspect the idle air control valve (if equipped).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll when cornering, and increased stopping distances. Visual inspection may reveal leaking fluid from the shocks/struts.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shock absorbers or struts. It's recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

**Summary**

The 2011 Toyota Avanza, while generally reliable, can experience issues with its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical components, and exterior. The severity and cost of these issues vary. Engine oil consumption, rough idling, and transmission shifting problems are among the more concerning issues that can be costly to repair. Suspension wear is common but usually manageable. Electrical issues, like faulty power window switches, are generally less expensive to fix. Rust can be a concern, especially in regions with harsh climates. Potential buyers should inspect these areas carefully.
