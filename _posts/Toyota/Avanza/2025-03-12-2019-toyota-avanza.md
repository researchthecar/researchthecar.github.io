The 2019 Toyota Avanza is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its affordability and practicality, particularly in markets where space and fuel efficiency are paramount. The 2019 Avanza primarily comes with two engine options: a 1.3-liter and a 1.5-liter inline-4 gasoline engine. The 1.5-liter engine typically produces around 103 horsepower and 101 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Avanza for its spacious interior, making it suitable for families or carrying cargo. However, it's often criticized for its somewhat underpowered engine, especially when fully loaded, and its basic interior features and ride quality.

**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported engine knocking or pinging, especially under heavy load or acceleration. This can be more pronounced when using lower octane fuel.
    *   Solution: Using higher octane fuel (as recommended by the manufacturer) may alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, the engine's ECU may need to be recalibrated or, rarely, internal engine components checked for damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (ECU recalibration); $500+ (engine component inspection/repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or unstable idling, sometimes stalling, can occur.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body, inspecting and replacing the idle air control valve (if equipped), or checking for vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.3L Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**
*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delays in shifting between gears, or harsh "jerky" shifts. This can worsen over time.
    *   Solution: Begin with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal component wear may require a more extensive repair or a transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid/filter); $500 - $2500+ (valve body/rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**
*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of suspension bushings, leading to clunking noises, especially when going over bumps. Most commonly affects the front lower control arm bushings and stabilizer bar bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dimming or Flickering Headlights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlights dimming or flickering intermittently, often noticeable at idle or low RPMs. Can be caused by a failing alternator or a loose/corroded ground connection.
    *   Solution: Test the alternator output. Check and clean all ground connections. Replace the alternator if it's not functioning correctly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+ (alternator replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate smoothly, getting stuck, or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Inspect the window regulator and motor. Lubricate the window tracks. Replace the regulator or motor if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Prone**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Especially in areas with road salt, the Avanza can be prone to rust in areas such as the underside of the vehicle, wheel arches, and around body seams.
    *   Solution: Regular washing, waxing, and undercoating can help prevent rust. Repairing rust spots as they appear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or non-existent airflow from the AC system.
    *   Solution: Check the refrigerant level and look for leaks. Inspect the AC compressor and condenser. Replace the cabin air filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2019 Toyota Avanza, while reliable, has some common issues. Engine pinging and idle problems can be addressed relatively inexpensively, but more serious issues like transmission problems or electrical failures can lead to more significant repair costs. Rust is a concern, especially in colder climates, but can be mitigated with preventative care. The severity and cost of these issues range from minor inconveniences to more substantial repairs, making it important to thoroughly inspect a used Avanza before purchase.
