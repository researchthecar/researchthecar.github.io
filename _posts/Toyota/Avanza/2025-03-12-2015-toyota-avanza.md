The 2015 Toyota Avanza is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its affordability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. It's often favored by families and businesses needing a versatile vehicle for transporting people and cargo. The 2015 Avanza typically comes with a 1.3L or 1.5L four-cylinder engine. The 1.5L engine produces approximately 103 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Avanza's spacious interior and ease of parking, but some dislike its relatively underpowered engine, basic features, and somewhat dated styling.

**Engine**

**1.3L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **No Issues Found**

**1.5L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between gears 1-2 or 2-3. Can also be accompanied by delayed engagement when shifting from Park or Neutral into Drive.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, perform a fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, have a mechanic diagnose the transmission for potential valve body issues or worn internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid and filter); $500 - $1500+ (valve body repair or replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clutch may slip, especially under heavy acceleration or when climbing hills. This manifests as the engine revving higher than normal without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. It's also recommended to inspect the flywheel for wear or damage and resurface or replace it as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or rough roads. This is often attributed to worn bushings in the front control arms or stabilizer bar links.
    *   Solution: Inspect the suspension bushings for cracks, tears, or excessive play. Replace any worn bushings with new ones. Consider using polyurethane bushings for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the number of bushings replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Power Window Switch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may become inoperative or work intermittently. This is often caused by a faulty switch on the driver's side door.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **AC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AC blower motor may stop working, resulting in no airflow from the vents. This can be caused by a faulty blower motor or a failing blower motor resistor.
    *   Solution: Test the blower motor and resistor to determine which component is faulty. Replace the faulty component with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Toyota Avanza generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but owners have reported some common issues. The most frequently mentioned complaints involve the 4-speed automatic transmission's shifting quality and the premature wear of suspension components, especially bushings. Some electrical issues related to the power windows and AC blower motor are also reported. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more substantial repairs. The cost to address these problems can vary significantly depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage. While not excessively expensive, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing.
