The 2018 Toyota Avanza is a compact Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV) known for its practicality, affordability, and seating capacity, often used as a family car or for commercial purposes in some markets. The 2018 Avanza in the Indonesian market comes with two engine options: a 1.3-liter inline-4 (1NR-VE) producing approximately 95 horsepower and 121 Nm of torque, and a 1.5-liter inline-4 (2NR-VE) delivering about 104 horsepower and 136 Nm of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate its spacious interior and fuel efficiency, but some dislike its relatively underpowered engine, particularly when fully loaded, and its basic interior features.
