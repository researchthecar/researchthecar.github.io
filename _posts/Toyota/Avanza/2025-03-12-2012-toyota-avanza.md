The 2012 Toyota Avanza is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its affordability and practicality, especially in markets like Southeast Asia. It typically came with a 1.3L or 1.5L inline-4 gasoline engine. The 1.5L engine produced around 103 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque. It's often praised for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency, but criticized for its underpowered engine and basic features. Transmission options are usually a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Valve Train Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noises coming from the engine, particularly noticeable at idle or low speeds.
