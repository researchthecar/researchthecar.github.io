The 2010 Toyota Avanza is a compact Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV) known for its affordability and practicality, particularly in Asian markets. While engine options varied by region, a common choice was the 1.3L inline-4 engine, producing around 91 horsepower and approximately 86 lb-ft of torque. Another option was the 1.5L inline-4, delivering roughly 103 horsepower and 99 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate its spacious interior for its class, fuel efficiency, and reliability. Common dislikes include its somewhat underpowered engines (especially when fully loaded), basic interior finishes, and less-than-stellar ride quality.
