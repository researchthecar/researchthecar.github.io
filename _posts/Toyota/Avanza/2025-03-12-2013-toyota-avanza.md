The 2013 Toyota Avanza is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its practicality and affordability, primarily sold in Southeast Asian markets. The most common engine option is a 1.5L inline-4 gasoline engine, producing approximately 103 horsepower and 101 lb-ft of torque. A less common 1.3L engine was also available in some markets. Both engines are typically paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Avanza's spacious interior, fuel efficiency, and reliability. However, common complaints include its relatively underpowered engine, basic interior features, and somewhat bouncy ride.

The 4-speed automatic transmission may exhibit harsh shifting, potentially resolved by fluid changes or solenoid replacement. Suspension issues like a bouncy ride and premature bushing wear can affect ride comfort and require component replacement. Electrical problems like power window failure and central locking malfunctions can also occur. The vehicle is also rust prone, so it is best to regularly wash it. Overall, the issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, but they should be considered when purchasing a used 2013 Avanza.
