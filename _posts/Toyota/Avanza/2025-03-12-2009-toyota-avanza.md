The 2009 Toyota Avanza is a compact Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV) known for its affordability, practicality, and seating capacity. Available engines include the 1.3L K3-VE inline-4 engine producing approximately 91 horsepower and 89 lb-ft of torque, and the 1.5L 3SZ-VE inline-4 engine producing approximately 103 horsepower and 101 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Avanza's fuel efficiency and spacious interior, but some criticize its underpowered engines and basic features.
