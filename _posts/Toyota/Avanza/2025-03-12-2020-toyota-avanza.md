The 2020 Toyota Avanza is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its affordability and practicality, particularly in markets where space and fuel efficiency are valued. Common engine options include a 1.3L inline-4 producing around 95 horsepower and 89 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5L inline-4 producing around 103 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Avanza for its spacious interior (for its class), fuel economy, and Toyota's reputation for reliability. Dislikes often center on its somewhat basic interior, dated technology, and modest performance.

**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4**
* **Excessive Engine Vibration at Idle**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report noticeable engine vibration, particularly when the vehicle is idling. This can be felt through the steering wheel and seats.
    * Solution: Check engine mounts for wear or damage. Replacement of worn engine mounts is the typical fix. Sometimes, a software update to the engine control unit (ECU) can help smooth out the idle.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**
* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, especially between 1st and 2nd gear or 2nd and 3rd gear. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change using the correct Toyota-specified fluid may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a diagnostic scan may reveal issues with the transmission solenoids or valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 (fluid change), $500 - $1500+ (solenoid/valve body repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    * Solution: Inspect the rear shock absorbers and suspension bushings. Worn or damaged shocks or bushings should be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Malfunctioning Power Windows**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows operate intermittently or fail to operate at all.
    * Solution: Check the power window switch, wiring, and motor. A faulty switch is a common culprit. In some cases, the window regulator may be damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (switch), $200 - $400 (regulator)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling noises coming from the dashboard, particularly on rough roads.
    * Solution: This can be difficult to pinpoint. Common sources include loose trim pieces, wiring harnesses, or components behind the dashboard. Securing the loose components with foam padding or clips may resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the source and complexity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Loose Exterior Trim**
    * Description/Symptoms: Exterior trim pieces, such as plastic cladding or badges, become loose or detached.
    * Solution: Reattach the trim using appropriate adhesive or clips. In some cases, replacement of the trim piece may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+ (depending on the trim piece)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Toyota Avanza generally exhibits issues consistent with a budget-friendly MPV. Most reported problems are relatively minor, such as interior rattles and loose trim. Suspension and transmission issues, while present, don't appear to be widespread. Engine vibration on the 1.5L variant may be more concerning, but still often solvable with maintenance. Overall, while owners should be aware of these potential issues, the Avanza appears to maintain a reasonable level of reliability for its class and target market. The cost of repairs is generally moderate, aligning with the vehicle's affordable nature.
