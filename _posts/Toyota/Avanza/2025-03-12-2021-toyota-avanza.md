The 2021 Toyota Avanza is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its affordability, practicality, and spacious interior, making it a popular choice for families and businesses in some markets. It comes equipped with a 1.3L (rated at approximately 95 horsepower and 121 Nm of torque) and a 1.5L four-cylinder engine, offered with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission depending on the market. Owners generally appreciate its fuel efficiency and seating capacity, but some common complaints revolve around its underpowered engine, basic interior, and somewhat dated features.
