**Introduction**
The 2007 Toyota Avanza is a compact MPV that offers a spacious interior and reliable performance. It comes with a choice of two engine and transmission combinations: a 1.3-liter engine with a 5-speed manual transmission and a 1.5-liter engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission. While the Avanza is generally well-received for its practicality and affordability, some owners have reported certain issues with the vehicle.

**Engine**
* **1.3-liter**
    * **Timing chain noise:** Owners complain of a rattling or whining noise coming from the engine, particularly during startup or acceleration.
        * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner or timing chain guide.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * **Connecting rod bearing failure:** The connecting rod bearings can wear prematurely, leading to catastrophic engine damage.
        * Solution: Engine rebuilding or replacement.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * **EGR valve failure:** A faulty EGR valve can cause engine performance issues, including rough idling, stalling, and decreased fuel economy.
        * Solution: EGR valve replacement.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
* **1.5-liter**
    * **Valve seal leakage:** The valve seals can fail, allowing engine oil to leak into the cylinders. This can lead to smoking from the exhaust, increased oil consumption, and reduced engine performance.
        * Solution: Valve seal replacement.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    * **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak and engine performance issues.

        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**Transmission**
* **5-speed manual**
    * **Clutch failure:** The clutch can wear out prematurely, causing slipping or shuddering during gear changes.
        * Solution: Clutch replacement.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    * **Synchronizer wear:** The synchronizers in the transmission can wear out, leading to difficult or noisy gear changes.
        * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **4-speed automatic**
    * **Transmission slip:** The transmission may slip or hesitate during gear changes, particularly when cold or under load.
        * Solution: Transmission fluid replacement or transmission rebuild.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    * **Solenoid failure:** The transmission solenoids can fail, causing shifting issues and performance problems.
