The 2022 Toyota Avanza is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its affordability and practicality, particularly in Southeast Asian markets. It comes standard with a 1.5L 2NR-VE engine that produces around 103 horsepower and 101 lb-ft of torque paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a CVT. There is also a 1.3L 1NR-VE option that produces around 97 horsepower and 89 lb-ft of torque that is only offered with the 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the Avanza's spacious interior and fuel efficiency, but some criticize its basic features and relatively underpowered engine.
