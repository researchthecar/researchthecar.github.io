The 2017 Toyota Avanza is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its affordability, practicality, and spacious interior, making it popular in Southeast Asian markets. The 2017 model typically comes with a 1.3L or 1.5L inline-4 gasoline engine. The 1.5L engine produces approximately 103 horsepower and 101 lb-ft of torque.
