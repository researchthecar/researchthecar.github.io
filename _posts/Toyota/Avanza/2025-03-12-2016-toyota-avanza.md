The 2016 Toyota Avanza is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its practicality, affordability, and spaciousness. It generally comes with a 1.3L or 1.5L inline-4 gasoline engine. The 1.5L engine produces around 103 horsepower and 101 lb-ft of torque. Available transmissions are typically a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Avanza for its fuel efficiency, passenger capacity, and ease of maintenance. Common dislikes include its basic interior, limited power, and somewhat dated styling.

**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4 Gasoline**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Audible knocking or pinging sound from the engine, especially under acceleration. This can be caused by low-quality fuel, carbon buildup, or a faulty knock sensor.
    *   Solution: Use higher-octane fuel, clean the fuel injectors, check and replace the knock sensor if faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (Knock Sensor)

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil levels drop significantly between oil changes, requiring frequent top-ups. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Inspect for oil leaks, check valve stem seals and piston rings. Repair or replace as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (Depending on the cause and repair needed)

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable jerking or harshness during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and replace the filter. Inspect the transmission mounts and solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (Depending on the severity and what is needed)

* **Slipping Gears**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine revs high without corresponding acceleration.
    * Solution: Inspect transmission fluid level and condition. Replace fluid, filter, or potentially overhaul the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ (Depending on the cause and repair needed)
*   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the front and/or rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.)
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Power Window Switch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows become inoperable or only work intermittently.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Have the battery and charging system tested. Check for parasitic draws from aftermarket accessories or faulty electrical components. Repair or replace as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminates on the dashboard. ABS system may not function properly during hard braking.
    *   Solution: Diagnose which ABS sensor is faulty and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust near wheel wells and underbody**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust formation, especially in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Treat the rust with rust converter, apply body filler if needed, and repaint the affected areas. Consider undercoating to prevent future rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (Depending on the severity and extent of rust)

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air coming from the air conditioning vents.
    *   Solution: Check the refrigerant level and recharge if low. Inspect the compressor, condenser, and evaporator for leaks or damage. Replace faulty components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+
*   **Dashboard Cracking (Specific Regions with high sun exposure)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks developing on the dashboard surface, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Cover dashboard with protector or replace dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+

**Summary**
The 2016 Toyota Avanza, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. Engine knocking, excessive oil consumption, and transmission harsh shifting or slippage can occur, potentially leading to moderate to high repair costs. Electrical issues like faulty power window switches and ABS sensor failures can also arise, with relatively lower repair costs. Rust formation is a concern, particularly in regions with harsh weather conditions. Overall, it's important to inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing, paying attention to the engine, transmission, and suspension. Addressing these issues promptly can prevent further damage and maintain the Avanza's longevity.
