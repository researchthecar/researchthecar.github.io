**Introduction**

The 1993 Toyota Paseo is a sporty subcompact coupe known for its sleek design, affordability, and fuel efficiency. It is powered by a 1.5-liter inline-four engine mated to a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. Despite its modest performance figures (93 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque), the Paseo is praised for its agile handling and responsive steering. However, it has also been criticized for its limited interior space and lack of standard features.
