The 2006 Toyota Solara is a mid-size coupe or convertible known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 157 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. The 4-cylinder engine was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 was exclusively paired with a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Solara's smooth ride, fuel efficiency (especially with the 4-cylinder), and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common complaints include a somewhat bland driving experience and less-than-sporty handling.

**Summary**

The 2006 Toyota Solara generally exhibits the reliability expected of the Toyota brand. However, like any vehicle of its age, it's susceptible to certain issues. The most concerning potential issues are excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine and transmission issues in the 5-speed automatic paired with the 2.4L. Other issues, such as suspension noise and electrical problems, are less severe and generally less expensive to repair. Rust can be a concern, especially in colder climates. While not extremely common or severe compared to some other vehicles, it's important to be aware of these potential problems when considering a used 2006 Solara. Regular maintenance and inspections can help mitigate these risks. The potential cost to fix issues varies greatly, ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars for more extensive repairs.
