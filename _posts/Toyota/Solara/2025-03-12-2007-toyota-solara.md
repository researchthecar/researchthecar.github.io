The 2007 Toyota Solara is a two-door coupe or convertible known for its reliability and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. The inline-4 was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 was exclusively paired with a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Solara for its smooth ride and Toyota's reliability, but some dislike its somewhat bland styling and limited rear passenger space.
