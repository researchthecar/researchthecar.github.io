The 2003 Toyota Solara is a stylish and reliable coupe or convertible known for its comfortable ride and reputation for Toyota dependability. Available with either a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine producing around 157 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque or a 3.3L V6 engine producing around 225 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, it offered a blend of fuel efficiency and performance. Both engines were offered with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and overall reliability. Common dislikes often include its somewhat bland styling and the less engaging driving experience compared to sportier coupes.
