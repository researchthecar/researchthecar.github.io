The 2002 Toyota Solara is a sporty coupe or convertible known for its reliability and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing around 157 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing around 200 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Solara's smooth ride and Toyota's reputation for dependability, but some find the styling somewhat bland and the handling less sporty than expected for a coupe.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often originating from the valve cover gasket or oil pan gasket. Visible oil stains under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil levels are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gasket or oil pan gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**3.0L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often from the valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, or oil pump seal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.0L V6 can be prone to sludge buildup if oil changes are neglected. This can lead to reduced oil flow, overheating, and engine damage.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil can help prevent sludge. If sludge is present, professional engine cleaning or even engine replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil change and flush) to $3000+ (engine replacement).

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, especially between gears, can be a problem. This can sometimes be attributed to worn-out transmission fluid or faulty solenoids.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, solenoid replacement or a transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$250 (fluid flush) to $1500-$3000+ (rebuild or replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride quality, excessive bouncing, and clunking noises from the suspension. Uneven tire wear can also be a sign.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle

*   **Sway Bar Link Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front end, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    * Solution: Replacing the sway bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the extent of the rust.

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or warping of the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or the use of a dashboard cover.

**Summary**

The 2002 Toyota Solara is generally a reliable car, but like any vehicle of this age, it is susceptible to certain common issues. Oil leaks (both engine types), transmission shifting problems, and suspension wear are some of the more prevalent concerns. While most repairs are relatively affordable, engine or transmission rebuilds can be costly. Potential buyers should have a mechanic inspect the car, particularly focusing on these known problem areas, before purchasing.
