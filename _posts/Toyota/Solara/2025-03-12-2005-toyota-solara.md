**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored closely. Blue smoke from the exhaust might be present.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can resolve the issue, but this is a significant repair. Monitoring oil levels and using a thicker oil grade can sometimes mitigate the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover gasket, causing a burning smell and potentially leading to oil loss.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks (Timing Cover, Rear Main Seal)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks originating from the timing cover or rear main seal. Visible oil drips and a burning smell are common symptoms.
