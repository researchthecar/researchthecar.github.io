The 2024 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck offering a blend of capability, comfort, and Toyota reliability. Engine options include a 3.5L Twin-Turbo V6 producing 389 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque, as well as a hybrid variant of the same engine, which boosts output to 437 horsepower and 583 lb-ft of torque. The Tundra is praised for its powerful engine options, comfortable ride, and updated interior. However, some common criticisms include its fuel economy and some reported issues with the infotainment system. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.5L Twin-Turbo V6**
*   **Wastegate Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, check engine light illuminated, whistling or hissing noise from the engine bay. The wastegate actuator, responsible for controlling turbocharger boost pressure, can fail.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the wastegate actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L Twin-Turbo V6 Hybrid**
*   **High Voltage Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced hybrid system performance, decreased fuel economy, error messages related to the hybrid battery or charging system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and potential replacement of hybrid battery components or the entire battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the specific issue and component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation or delay when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Software update of the Transmission Control Module (TCM), or in some cases, replacement of valve body components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ (depending on the severity and required repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Problems (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, uneven ride height, error messages related to the air suspension system, failure of the compressor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the air suspension system and replacement of faulty components such as air springs, compressor, or sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the specific component and if it requires repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or randomly reboots.
    *   Solution: Software update to the infotainment system. In some cases, hardware replacement of the head unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue) to $1,500+ (if hardware replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate readings, false alarms, or complete failure of the sensor systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty sensor(s) and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor (depending on location and type)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Bed Bounce**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing or shaking felt in the cabin, especially when driving on uneven roads or highways.
    *   Solution: This issue is inherent to the design and construction of the Tundra's frame and bed. Some owners have reported success in reducing the effect with aftermarket suspension modifications or bed reinforcement kits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the chosen aftermarket solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Creaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattles and creaks emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or seats.
    *   Solution: Locating and addressing the source of the noise. This may involve tightening loose screws, applying felt tape or padding to contact points, or replacing damaged trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the severity and complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Toyota Tundra, while generally reliable, has some reported issues. The most significant problems seem to revolve around the hybrid system's high voltage battery, wastegate actuator failures on the non-hybrid engine, infotainment system glitches, and suspension issues. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, with some requiring only minor software updates while others necessitate more extensive and costly repairs. The "bed bounce" issue is less of a defect and more of a characteristic of the truck's design. It's important for prospective buyers to be aware of these potential problems and to thoroughly inspect any used Tundra before purchase.
