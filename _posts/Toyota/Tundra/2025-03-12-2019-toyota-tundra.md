The 2019 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and strong resale value. It comes standard with a 4.6-liter V8 engine producing 310 horsepower and 327 lb-ft of torque. An optional and more common engine is the 5.7-liter V8 engine producing 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

Some common complaints include its relatively poor fuel economy and outdated technology compared to competitors.

**Summary**

The 2019 Toyota Tundra remains a reliable truck but has some notable issues. The most significant potential problems revolve around the 5.7L V8 engine (cam tower oil leaks, secondary air injection pump failure) and the 6-speed automatic transmission (torque converter shudder). Other concerns include suspension squeaks, electrical glitches with the Entune system, and exterior/interior cosmetic issues. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements or lubrication to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission work. While no widespread recalls affect the described issues, it's always best to check the NHTSA website using the VIN of any vehicle you are considering to confirm the most up-to-date recall information.
