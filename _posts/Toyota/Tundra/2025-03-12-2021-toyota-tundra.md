The 2021 Toyota Tundra represents the final year of the second-generation model before a major redesign. It is available exclusively with a 5.7L V8 engine producing 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Tundra for its reliability and strong resale value. Common complaints include its outdated design, poor fuel economy, and lack of modern features compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**5.7L V8**

*   **Secondary Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, error codes related to the secondary air injection system, rough idling, and potential for the engine to enter limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty secondary air injection pump and/or valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, especially when cold, accompanied by a possible exhaust smell in the cabin and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked or warped exhaust manifold and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable vibration or shudder during light acceleration, typically at highway speeds, often described as feeling like driving over rumble strips.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or performing a transmission fluid flush using updated fluid can sometimes alleviate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Applying lubricant to the leaf spring bushings and contact points. In severe cases, replacement of the bushings or leaf springs may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (lubrication), $300 - $1,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **TRD Pro FOX Shock Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: (Specific to TRD Pro models) Oil leaking from the FOX shocks, indicating a seal failure.
    *   Solution: Shock replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Entune Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Entune infotainment system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a reboot.
    *   Solution: Software update of the Entune system or replacement of the head unit in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Distorted image, flickering, or complete failure of the backup camera.

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame (Primarily in Rust Belt States)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Surface rust or, in severe cases, structural rust on the frame, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust inhibitor application, frame coating, or, in extreme cases, frame replacement (though this is rare for a 2021 model).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2021 Toyota Tundra is generally a reliable truck. The most common issues are related to the engine (secondary air injection and exhaust manifold), the transmission (torque converter shudder), suspension (squeaking leaf springs and leaking shocks on TRD Pro models), and the electrical system (infotainment glitches and backup camera failures). The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs, with repair costs potentially exceeding $2,000 for some engine and transmission related problems. Frame rust, while possible, is less of a concern for a 2021 model year vehicle compared to older Tundras.
