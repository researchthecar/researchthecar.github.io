The 2007 Toyota Tundra marked a significant redesign for Toyota's full-size pickup truck. Engine options included a 4.0L V6, a 4.7L V8, and a 5.7L V8. Transmission options typically consisted of a 5-speed automatic (for the 4.0L and early 4.7L) and a 6-speed automatic (later 4.7L and 5.7L). Owners often praised the Tundra for its reliability, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Common dislikes included fuel economy, some interior materials, and the truck's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tighter spaces. The 5.7L V8 produced 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque, making it a popular choice for those needing robust performance.

**Summary**

The 2007 Toyota Tundra, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. The most notable are the potential for cam tower oil leaks on the 5.7L V8, air injection pump failures across all engine options, and frame rust depending on geographical location. Suspension components like leaf springs and lower ball joints can also exhibit wear and tear. Interior issues like dash cracking are common. The severity and cost of repairs vary, with frame rust being potentially the most expensive issue to address. Buyers should inspect these areas carefully before purchasing a used 2007 Tundra.
