The 2017 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and ruggedness. It was available with two engine options: a 4.6L V8 producing 310 horsepower and 327 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L V8 producing 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Tundra for its dependability, strong resale value, and comfortable ride.
