The 2004 Toyota Tundra is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and durability. Engine options included a 3.4L V6 (190 hp, 220 lb-ft of torque) and a 4.7L V8 (240 hp, 315 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options consisted of a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Tundra for its build quality and longevity, while some criticized its fuel economy and relatively basic interior. The following list details some common issues reported by owners of the 2004 Toyota Tundra.

**Engine**

**3.4L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.4L V6 is an interference engine. The timing belt wears over time and can eventually break. A broken timing belt will cause catastrophic damage to the engine. Symptoms include engine misfires, rough running, and eventually a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt according to the manufacturer's recommended service interval (typically every 90,000 miles). Also replace the water pump and idler pulleys while the engine is disassembled.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ (if only replacing the belt/water pump during routine maintenance)

**4.7L V8 (2UZ-FE)**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks can develop in the exhaust manifolds, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking noise, especially upon cold start, and a decrease in fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (A340E/A340F)**

*   **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can develop issues with shifting smoothness and slippage, especially at higher mileage. This can be due to worn clutch packs or valve body issues. Symptoms include delayed engagement, erratic shifting, and slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change as an initial step. If the issue persists, rebuild or replace the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (fluid/filter change), $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replace)

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The lower ball joints can wear out and fail, leading to a dangerous loss of control. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the lower ball joints. Inspect and replace upper ball joints and other suspension components as necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken Leaves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time or break, especially if the truck is frequently used for towing or hauling. Symptoms include a noticeably lower ride height in the rear, reduced load-carrying capacity, and a rough ride.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of gauges or the entire instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replace the instrument cluster or have it professionally repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

*   **Starter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The starter motor fails, resulting in a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replace the starter motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the frame, especially in regions where salt is used on roads. Severe rust can compromise the structural integrity of the truck.
    *   Solution: Inspect the frame for rust regularly. Apply rust inhibitors to prevent further corrosion. In severe cases, frame repair or replacement may be necessary (if possible).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (rust inhibitor application), $1,000 - $5,000+ (frame repair/replacement)

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack, particularly in warmer climates, due to sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Install a dashboard cover or replace the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (dashboard cover), $500 - $1,500+ (dashboard replacement)

**Recalls:**

*   **None Found**

The 2004 Toyota Tundra is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of the potential for issues such as timing belt replacement (V6), exhaust manifold leaks (V8), lower ball joint and leaf spring failures. Frame rust, electrical issues, and interior problems are also common. The cost to address these issues can vary depending on the severity of the problem and the location.
