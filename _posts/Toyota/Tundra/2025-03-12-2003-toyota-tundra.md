The 2003 Toyota Tundra is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and durability. Available engine options include a 3.4L V6 producing 190 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.7L V8 producing 245 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners often praise the Tundra for its comfortable ride, strong engine performance (especially the V8), and Toyota's reputation for longevity. Some common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy (especially with the V8) and some reports of rust issues, particularly in regions with harsh winters.

**Engine**

**4.7L 2UZ-FE V8**

*   **Valve Stem Seals Leaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, especially upon start-up after the vehicle has been sitting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or exhaust leak noise, reduced fuel economy, potential for failed emissions test.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifold. Aftermarket headers are another option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.4L 5VZ-FE V6**

*   **Timing Belt Replacement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Recommended maintenance interval is every 90,000 miles. Failure to replace the belt can lead to catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms of a worn belt can include ticking noises or misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing belt, water pump, and other related components (tensioners, idler pulleys).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $900+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A340E 4-Speed Automatic (Most common with 3.4L V6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, transmission slipping out of gear, or failure to engage gears. Can be more noticeable when cold.
    *   Solution: Often starts with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush ($150 - $300), valve body ($500 - $1,200+), rebuild/replace ($2,000 - $4,000+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**A750E 5-Speed Automatic (Most common with 4.7L V8, some later V6 models)**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, loose steering. If neglected, complete ball joint separation can occur, leading to loss of control.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lower ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sag/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the truck sitting lower than normal, reduced load-carrying capacity, rough ride. Visible cracking or broken leaves.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf spring pack. Add-a-leaf kits are a temporary solution but don't address the underlying problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of gauges (speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge), dim or flickering display.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Starter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking sound when turning the key, engine fails to crank.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the starter motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Frame)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust on the frame, especially in areas exposed to road salt. Severe rust can compromise the structural integrity of the truck.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, rust prevention treatments, or in extreme cases, frame replacement (very costly).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Rust repair ($200 - $1,000+), frame replacement ($5,000 - $10,000+)
    *   Recalls: There have been a few recalls and service campaigns relating to corrosion issues on Tundras and Tacomas, but not specifically for the 2003 model year, it is still worth checking with your local dealer to check if any campaigns or recalls exist for your vehicle.

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboards**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or use of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2003 Toyota Tundra is generally a reliable truck, but like any vehicle of this age, it has some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues, like valve stem seal leaks and exhaust manifold cracks, are something to be aware of. Suspension issues like lower ball joint failure can be dangerous if left unaddressed, and frame rust can be a significant concern in certain regions. Electrical issues such as instrument cluster failures and starter failure are more nuisance than critical. Overall, the Tundra can be a good purchase if properly maintained and inspected for these common problems.
