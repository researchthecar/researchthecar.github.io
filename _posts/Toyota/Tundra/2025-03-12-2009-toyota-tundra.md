The 2009 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and durability. Engine options include a 4.0L V6 (236 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque), a 4.7L V8 (276 hp and 313 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.7L V8 (381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options are primarily a 5-speed automatic for the V6 and 5-speed or 6-speed automatic for the V8 engines. Owners often praise the Tundra for its strong towing capacity, spacious cabin, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, especially with the larger V8, and some reported issues with specific components as the vehicle ages.
