The 2015 Toyota Tundra is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and capability. Available engine options include a 4.0L V6, a 4.6L V8, and a 5.7L V8. The 5.7L V8 produces 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. Many owners appreciate the Tundra's robust build quality, spacious cabin, and strong resale value. However, some common complaints include lower fuel economy compared to competitors and a somewhat dated interior design. Transmissions available are a 5-speed automatic (with the 4.0L V6), a 6-speed automatic (with the 4.6L and 5.7L V8).

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may develop from the valve cover gaskets. Signs include visible oil leaks on the engine, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L V8**

*   **Secondary Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The secondary air injection system helps reduce emissions during cold starts. The pump can fail, leading to a check engine light and potential engine stalling. Error codes P2440, P2441, P2442, P2443, P2444, P2445, P2446, P2447, P2448, and P2449 are commonly associated with this issue.
    *   Solution: Replace the secondary air injection pump and possibly the air injection switching valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Tower Oil Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil seeps or drips from the cam tower area on the cylinder heads. This can result in an oily smell, visible oil accumulation around the cam towers, and eventually, low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Resealing the cam towers with new sealant. This is a labor-intensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (AB60E/AB60F)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibration felt during light acceleration, typically between 35-45 mph. This is due to wear or issues within the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission flush and fluid change may temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This is common due to friction between the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Applying lubricant between the leaf springs or replacing worn-out leaf spring bushings. In severe cases, the leaf springs themselves may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (lubrication/bushings), $500 - $1000+ (leaf spring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera display intermittently fails to show an image, shows a distorted image, or stops working altogether.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections, replace the camera, or update the vehicle's software if applicable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and if replacement is necessary)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Surface rust, or in more severe cases, structural rust, can appear on the frame, especially in areas exposed to road salt or harsh weather conditions.
    *   Solution: Rust remediation through cleaning and applying rust inhibitors/coatings, or frame replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (rust treatment), $5000+ (frame replacement if feasible)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or splitting of the dashboard material, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or use of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on the severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Toyota Tundra generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but some common issues can arise. The 5.7L V8 engine can experience secondary air injection pump failures and cam tower oil leaks which can be costly to fix. The 6-speed transmission can exhibit torque converter shudder. Rust on the frame is another area to inspect, especially in colder climates. While the Tundra is known for its longevity, addressing these potential issues proactively can ensure a positive ownership experience.
