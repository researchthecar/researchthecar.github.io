**Summary**

The 2013 Toyota Tundra is generally a reliable truck, but it does have some common issues. The most prevalent seem to be related to the 5.7L V8 engine and transmission. The cam tower oil leak can be expensive to repair, and the secondary air injection pump failure can be a nuisance. The torque converter shudder in the transmission is also a fairly common complaint. While some issues, like the bed bounce, may be more of an annoyance than a major problem, others, such as leaf spring corrosion or water pump failure, can lead to significant repair costs if left unaddressed. Overall, the 2013 Tundra is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected before purchasing.
