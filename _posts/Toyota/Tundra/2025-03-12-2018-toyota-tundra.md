**Summary**

The 2018 Toyota Tundra is generally a reliable truck, but it does have some common issues. The most significant and potentially costly is the cam tower oil leak on the 5.7L V8, and torque converter shudder with the 6-speed transmission. Other issues, such as the leaf spring squeak and electrical problems, are generally less severe and less expensive to fix. While dashboard cracking can be unsightly, it is more of a cosmetic issue. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and inspect the vehicle carefully before purchasing.
