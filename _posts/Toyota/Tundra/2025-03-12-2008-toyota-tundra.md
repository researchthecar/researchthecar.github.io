The 2008 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and durability. Engine options include a 4.0L V6 (236 hp, 266 lb-ft of torque), a 4.7L V8 (276 hp, 313 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.7L V8 (381 hp, 401 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options varied depending on the engine, including 5-speed automatic and 6-speed automatic transmissions. Owners often praise the Tundra for its powerful engine (especially the 5.7L), comfortable ride, and towing capability. Common complaints include fuel economy, some interior materials feeling cheap, and the truck's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**4.7L V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**5.7L V8**

*   **Camshaft Spool Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine ticking noise, check engine light, reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft spool valve (variable valve timing actuator).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking/Leaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing noise from the engine, especially on cold starts, reduced fuel economy, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Secondary Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, loud noise from the engine compartment (especially on startup), and potentially reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the secondary air injection pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (typically paired with 4.0L V6 and some 4.7L V8 models)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6-Speed Automatic (typically paired with 5.7L V8 and some 4.7L V8 models)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or shuddering sensation, especially at lower speeds and under light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush with updated fluid may temporarily alleviate the issue, but replacement is generally the long-term fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Popping or clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Loose steering and uneven tire wear can also occur.  If left unaddressed, can lead to catastrophic failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the lower ball joints.  It is recommended to replace both sides at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Starter Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noise when trying to start the engine, engine fails to crank, intermittent starting issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the starter motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive rust on the frame, particularly in areas exposed to road salt. This can lead to structural weakness.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions range from rust remediation and coating to frame replacement (if the rust is severe).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on severity and chosen solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard, or use of a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 (cover) or $1000-$2000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Toyota Tundra is generally a reliable truck, but some common issues include exhaust manifold cracking/leaking, secondary air injection pump failure, and potential torque converter shudder (especially with the 5.7L V8 and 6-speed transmission). Rust on the frame can be a serious concern, especially in areas with road salt. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive (camshaft spool valve), others like exhaust manifold replacement or torque converter repair can be costly.
