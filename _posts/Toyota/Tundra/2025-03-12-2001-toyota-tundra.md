The 2001 Toyota Tundra was a significant entry for Toyota into the full-size truck market. It was available with a 3.4L V6 engine producing 190 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, as well as a 4.7L V8 engine producing 245 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque. The transmissions available were a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual (V6 only). Owners often praise the Tundra for its reliability, build quality, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include lower fuel economy compared to smaller trucks and some age-related issues due to its age.

**Engine**

**3.4L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.4L V6 is an interference engine, meaning if the timing belt breaks, the pistons can collide with the valves, causing severe engine damage. Symptoms leading to this include ticking noises, rough idling, or a complete engine stall.
    *   Solution: Regular timing belt replacement (every 90,000 miles or 7 years) is crucial. Replacement includes the belt, tensioner, and water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve covers, leading to burning oil smell and potential oil loss.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.7L V8 (2UZ-FE)**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or hissing sound, especially upon cold start, which may diminish as the engine warms up. This is due to cracks in the exhaust manifold.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifold, typically with an aftermarket manifold or a refurbished OEM part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Toyota Tundra is generally considered a reliable truck, but like any vehicle of its age, it has its share of common issues. Engine issues, particularly timing belt maintenance for the 3.4L and exhaust manifold cracks for the 4.7L, are key concerns. Transmission problems in the automatic variants can be costly. Suspension wear is typical for a truck of this age. Rust, especially on the frame, is a major area to inspect. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or frame repair, can be significant. Overall, the 2001 Tundra is a solid truck, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into the purchase price and maintenance budget.
