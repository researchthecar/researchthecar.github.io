The 2000 Toyota Tundra was a groundbreaking truck for Toyota, marking their entry into the full-size pickup market in North America. It was offered with two engine options: a 3.4L V6 producing around 190 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.7L V8 generating approximately 245 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were generally paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the Tundra for its reliability, durability, and comfortable ride compared to domestic trucks of the time. However, some criticisms include its smaller size compared to other full-size trucks and potential issues with rust, particularly in areas with road salt.

**Engine**

**3.4L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.4L V6 is an interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, the pistons can collide with the valves, causing significant engine damage. Symptoms include engine misfires, rough running, and eventually, complete engine failure if the belt breaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing belt is necessary every 90,000 miles. It is generally recommended to replace the water pump and other related components at the same time to avoid future repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ depending on the shop and if additional components are replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, or the oil pan gasket. This can lead to reduced oil levels, causing potential engine damage if not addressed. Visible oil spots under the vehicle and the smell of burning oil are also common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the standard fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for valve cover gaskets, $300 - $800+ for rear main seal, $200 - $500+ for oil pan gasket.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.7L V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as the 3.4L V6: Oil leaks from valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, or the oil pan gasket. This can lead to reduced oil levels, causing potential engine damage if not addressed. Visible oil spots under the vehicle and the smell of burning oil are also common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the standard fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for valve cover gaskets, $300 - $800+ for rear main seal, $200 - $500+ for oil pan gasket.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks in the exhaust manifolds are common, leading to exhaust leaks, a ticking noise (especially when cold), and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifold(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per manifold, depending on the shop and the cost of the manifold.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, failure to shift, or harsh shifts. Can trigger the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+, depending on the shop and whether the entire valve body needs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration. Can also cause stalling or failure to engage gears properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter and potentially flushing the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+, depending on the shop and the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive play in the front suspension, clunking noises when turning or going over bumps, and uneven tire wear. If the ball joint fails completely, it can cause a loss of control.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lower ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side, including labor and parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sag/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the truck sitting lower than normal, reduced load-carrying capacity, and a harsh ride. Broken or cracked leaf springs are also possible.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ for both sides, depending on the shop and the quality of the replacement springs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, a dead battery, and the battery warning light illuminating on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+, including labor and parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame and Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is a significant issue, especially in areas with road salt. Frame rust can compromise the structural integrity of the truck, while body panel rust can affect its appearance.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, options range from rust repair and painting to complete frame replacement (if the rust is severe).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ for body panel rust repair, frame repair varies greatly depending on severity and the extent of damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ for replacement, $50 - $200+ for a cover.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2000 Toyota Tundra is a generally reliable truck, but it is not without its potential issues. The most significant concerns are related to rust (frame and body), oil leaks (both engine options), and potential timing belt issues on the 3.4L V6. Suspension components like lower ball joints and leaf springs are also prone to wear and failure. While these issues can be costly to repair, addressing them promptly can help ensure the longevity and safety of the vehicle.
