The 2016 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and capability. Available engine options include a 4.6L V8 producing 310 hp and 327 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 5.7L V8 producing 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Tundra for its comfortable ride, strong resale value, and robust build quality. Common criticisms include its relatively poor fuel economy compared to competitors and its somewhat dated interior design.

**Engine**

**5.7L V8**

* **Secondary Air Injection Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, codes P2440, P2441, P2442, P2443, P2444, P2445, P0412, P0415, P0416, P0418, P106B, P106C. Loud noise during cold starts.
    * Solution: Replace the failed air injection pump(s) and/or valve(s). Bypassing the system is an option, but may have emissions implications.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Cam Tower Oil Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leak around the cam towers at the rear of the engine. Oil dripping onto exhaust manifolds causing a burning smell.
    * Solution: Reseal the cam towers with new sealant. This is a labor-intensive job.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**4.6L V8**
* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

* **Torque Converter Shudder/Vibration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vibration or shudder felt during light acceleration, typically between 35-45 mph. May be more pronounced when towing.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and fill using Toyota WS fluid. In severe cases, torque converter replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Squeak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noise coming from the rear leaf springs, especially noticeable when going over bumps.
    * Solution: Apply lubricant to the leaf spring bushings and contact points. Replacement of leaf spring bushings may be required in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Entune Radio Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent freezing, crashing, or unresponsive touch screen on the Entune infotainment system. Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    * Solution: Software update (if available). In some cases, replacement of the head unit may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue) - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Bed Bounce**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing or shaking of the truck bed, especially noticeable on uneven road surfaces.
    * Solution: This is inherent in the design of some trucks. Aftermarket solutions include adding weight to the bed, upgrading shocks, or installing a bed stiffener.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking (in Hot Climates)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight and high temperatures.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard. Using a sunshade can help prevent further cracking.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Toyota Tundra generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but some owners have reported issues, primarily with the 5.7L V8 engine (air injection pump failure, cam tower leaks) and the 6-speed automatic transmission (torque converter shudder). Electrical issues with the Entune system and exterior issues such as bed bounce were also reported. While some issues can be resolved relatively inexpensively (e.g., leaf spring squeak), others, such as cam tower oil leaks or dashboard replacement, can be costly. Most issues do not affect safety. Overall, the 2016 Tundra is considered a reliable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
