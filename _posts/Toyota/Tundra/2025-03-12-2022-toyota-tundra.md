The 2022 Toyota Tundra marked a significant redesign for the popular full-size truck. It came with two primary engine options: a 3.5L Twin-Turbo V6 and a hybrid version of the same engine, dubbed the i-FORCE MAX. The standard 3.5L V6 produces 389 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque, while the i-FORCE MAX bumps that up to 437 horsepower and 583 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Many owners praised the Tundra's updated interior, improved ride quality (especially with the available air suspension), and powerful engine options. However, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's user interface, fuel economy not meeting expectations (particularly with the hybrid), and certain quality control issues that surfaced in the initial production run.

**Engine**

**3.5L Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Wastegate Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining sound, reduced engine performance, check engine light. May be related to a software issue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the wastegate actuator or a software update to the engine control unit (ECU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on location and parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**

    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L Twin-Turbo V6 i-FORCE MAX (Hybrid)**

*   **Hybrid System Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights, reduced power, the engine may not start or may stall. Issues with the hybrid battery or control systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the hybrid system, which could involve replacing the battery, inverter, or other components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts, especially between certain gears. Delays in shifting, particularly when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (reflash) to $5,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revving without corresponding acceleration, loss of power.
    *   Solution: Inspection for leaks, fluid level, and contamination. Valve body replacement, or transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (minor repair) to $5,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, failure to maintain ride height, error messages. Leaks in the air lines or failure of the air compressor.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the air lines, air struts, or air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**

    *   Solution: Software updates to the infotainment system. Replacement of the head unit in more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,500+ (head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate readings, false alarms, or complete failure of the sensor systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the affected sensor and replacement if necessary. Calibration of the sensor system after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Bed Bounce/Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive shaking or vibration felt in the bed, especially at higher speeds or on rough roads.
    *   Solution: This issue has been attributed to the frame design and bed mounting. Potential fixes could involve modified bed mounts or aftermarket solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500+ for aftermarket solutions.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Toyota Tundra, while a significant improvement in many areas, has faced several issues. Engine problems, particularly wastegate actuator and turbocharger failures in the non-hybrid and hybrid system malfunctions in the i-FORCE MAX, can be costly. Transmission issues like harsh shifting and slipping are also concerns. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sensors are common annoyances. Exterior issues like bed bounce and water leaks, along with interior rattles, affect overall satisfaction. While some issues can be resolved with software updates, others require expensive component replacements. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase, as well as check for any applicable recalls or technical service bulletins.
