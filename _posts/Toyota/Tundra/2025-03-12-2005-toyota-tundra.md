The 2005 Toyota Tundra is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and durability. It was offered with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing around 245 horsepower and 282 lb-ft of torque and a 4.7L V8 generating approximately 282 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 4-speed or 5-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners appreciate the Tundra's comfortable ride, strong engine performance, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. However, some common complaints include issues with rust, particularly in areas with harsh winters, and certain engine or transmission-related problems that can arise with age and mileage.

**Engine**

**4.7L 2UZ-FE V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often originating from the valve cover gaskets, can lead to a burning oil smell and visible oil stains on the engine or ground.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks in the exhaust manifold, usually occurring on the driver's side, result in exhaust leaks, a ticking noise, and potential reduction in engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.0L 1GR-FE V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**A340E/A340F 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **No Issues Found**

**A750E/A750F 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration during light acceleration, typically at lower speeds, indicates a potential torque converter issue.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush may temporarily alleviate the symptoms. More severe cases require torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive play in the front suspension, clunking noises, uneven tire wear, or a feeling of looseness in the steering can indicate worn or failing lower ball joints. This is a critical safety issue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lower ball joints. It is recommended to replace ball joints in pairs (both sides).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sag/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear end sag, especially when loaded. Broken or significantly rusted leaf springs may be visually apparent. Affects ride quality and load-carrying capacity.
    * Solution: Replacement of leaf springs. Can be done in pairs or individually, although pair replacement is recommended to maintain ride height and balance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ (per pair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Panel Light Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming or complete failure of the instrument panel lights can make it difficult to read gauges at night.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected bulbs or, in some cases, the entire instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Starter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine fails to crank when the key is turned, often accompanied by a clicking sound. May occur intermittently at first.
    * Solution: Replacement of the starter motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Frame Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Significant rust, especially on the frame, particularly in areas that use road salt. This can compromise the structural integrity of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, options range from rust remediation and coating to frame replacement (which is a very costly repair).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on severity and repair method).
    *   Recalls:
    *   * 09V044000
        *   NHTSA: On certain pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, if the spare tire is mounted underneath the vehicle, extensive corrosion could occur to the cable of the spare tire carrier. If this corrosion is not detected and repaired, the carrier cable may break and the spare tire could drop from underneath the vehicle.
    *   * 05V482000
        *   NHTSA: A corrosion-prevention compound was not applied to the propeller shaft (drive shaft) during the manufacturing process on some of these vehicles. Consequently, the propeller shaft could develop rust on the surface of the tube. This rust could progress to a point where the tube wall fractures. If the vehicle is operated with a fractured propeller shaft, the shaft could separate from the vehicle, resulting in a loss of vehicle control.

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks, particularly in hot climates, due to sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Toyota Tundra is generally a reliable truck, but some common issues include oil leaks, exhaust manifold cracks (4.7L V8), torque converter shudder (5-speed auto), lower ball joint failures, and frame rust. The severity and cost of these issues vary greatly depending on the truck's location, maintenance history, and overall condition. Frame rust, if severe, can be a deal-breaker due to the high cost of repair. Lower ball joint failure is a critical safety concern. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix (instrument panel lights), others like exhaust manifold replacement or torque converter replacement can be more costly.
