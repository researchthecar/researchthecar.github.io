**Introduction:**

The 2021 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck offered with a choice of three engine options: a 3.5L V6, a 4.6L V8, and a 5.7L V8. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic transmission for the 3.5L V6 and 4.6L V8, and a 10-speed automatic transmission for the 5.7L V8. The Tundra is known for its reliability, strong towing and payload capabilities, but it has received some criticism for its outdated interior and lack of modern technology features.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption has been reported, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes.
* **Valve Spring Failure:** Premature failure of the valve springs can cause engine noise and loss of power.
* **Timing Chain Issues:** Extended warranties have been issued to cover potential timing chain issues.

**4.6L V8**

* **Piston Ring Failure:** Failure of the piston rings can lead to low compression and increased oil consumption.
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A leaking intake manifold gasket can cause engine vacuum loss and poor performance.
* **Spark Plug Thread Stripping:** Stripping of spark plug threads can make it difficult to remove or replace spark plugs.

**5.7L V8**

* **Fuel Pump Problems:** The fuel pump may fail prematurely, causing the engine to stall or run poorly.
* **EGR Valve Failure:** The EGR valve can fail, affecting engine emissions and performance.
* **Knock Sensor Issues:** The knock sensors may fail, leading to incorrect engine timing and decreased power.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shifting Problems:** Hesitation or rough shifting when changing gears.
* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** Leaks from the transmission can cause fluid loss and transmission damage.
* **Torque Converter Issues:** The torque converter may fail, causing shuddering or slippage.

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Delayed Shifts:** Transmission may be slow to shift gears or may not shift at all.
* **Hard Shifting:** Transmission may shift gears harshly or with a noticeable thunk or jerk.
* **Transmission Noise:** Unusual noises, such as whining or grinding, may be present during operation.

* **Shocks/Struts Leak:** The shocks or struts may leak fluid, causing a decrease in ride comfort and handling ability.
* **Steering Rack Problems:** The steering rack may develop leaks or become loose, affecting steering precision and stability.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Excessive battery drain can occur when the vehicle is parked.
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may fail, preventing the battery from recharging.
* **Electrical Shorts:** Random electrical issues or component failures may be caused by electrical shorts within the wiring harness.

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate Handle Corrosion:** The tailgate handle may corrode and become difficult to open or close.
* **Hood Hinge Binding:** The hood hinges may bind or become difficult to open, especially in cold weather.
* **Door Panel Fading:** The door panels may fade or discolor over time.

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may malfunction, leading to incorrect temperature settings or air flow issues.
* **Seat Belt Buckle Binding:** The seat belt buckles may bind or become difficult to unbuckle.
* **Infotainment System Lag:** The infotainment system may experience lag or unresponsiveness.

**Summary:**

The 2021 Toyota Tundra has a range of issues affecting its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and interior. The severity and cost of these issues vary depending on the specific problem and part involved. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be more expensive or require major repairs. Overall, the Tundra's reliability has been somewhat questionable compared to previous model years.
