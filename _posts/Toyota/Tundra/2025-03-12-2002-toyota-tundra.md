The 2002 Toyota Tundra was a full-size pickup truck available in various configurations, offering a blend of reliability and capability. Engine options included a 3.4L V6 producing approximately 190 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.7L V8 generating around 245 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque. The V6 was typically paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 came standard with a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Tundra for its longevity, build quality, and smooth ride, while some criticisms included fuel economy and the relatively dated interior.

**Engine**

**3.4L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.4L V6 is an interference engine and the timing belt needs to be replaced every 90,000 miles. If the belt breaks, the engine will stop running immediately and may sustain significant internal damage, such as bent valves and damaged pistons.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt at or before the recommended interval. If the timing belt breaks, the engine may need extensive repairs, or even replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (Timing Belt Replacement), $2000 - $5000+ (Engine Repair/Replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak around the valve cover, visible oil on the engine block, burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found
