The 2023 Toyota Tundra represents a significant redesign for Toyota's full-size pickup truck. Engine options include a 3.5L twin-turbo V6 (i-FORCE) producing 389 hp and 479 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid version of the same engine (i-FORCE MAX) producing 437 hp and 583 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Tundra's bold styling, comfortable ride, and powerful engine options, particularly the hybrid. Common complaints often center around fuel economy, some aspects of the infotainment system, and initial issues related to the new platform.

**Summary**

The 2023 Toyota Tundra, while a significant improvement over previous generations, has exhibited some common issues. Engine problems range from turbocharger failures in the non-hybrid models to high-voltage battery issues in the hybrids. Transmission problems may be solved with a simple software update, however some owners have experienced more serious internal issues. Electrical issues such as infotainment system glitches and sensor malfunctions are also prevalent. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission replacements, can be quite costly.
