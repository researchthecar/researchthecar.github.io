The 2014 Toyota Tundra is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and strong resale value. Engine options include a 4.0L V6 producing 270 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque, a 4.6L V8 producing 310 horsepower and 327 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L V8 delivering 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. The 4.0L and 4.6L engines are paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.7L engine utilizes a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Tundra for its robust build quality, comfortable ride, and towing capabilities. However, some common complaints include lower fuel economy compared to competitors and a less modern interior design.

**Summary:**

The 2014 Toyota Tundra is a generally reliable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The most significant and potentially expensive issues are related to the 5.7L V8 engine, particularly the secondary air injection pump failure and exhaust manifold leaks. Frame rust is another concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. The 6-speed automatic transmission may exhibit torque converter shudder, which can lead to costly repairs. Other electrical and interior issues, such as the tailgate wire harness and airbag clockspring, are less severe but still require attention. Overall, while the Tundra is a solid choice, pre-purchase inspections are recommended to identify and address any potential problems, especially those related to rust and the 5.7L engine components.
