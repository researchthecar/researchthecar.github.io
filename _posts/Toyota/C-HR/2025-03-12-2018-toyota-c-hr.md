The 2018 Toyota C-HR is a subcompact crossover known for its distinctive styling and surprisingly agile handling. It came standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 144 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While owners generally appreciate the C-HR's unique appearance and fuel efficiency, some common complaints revolve around the lack of all-wheel drive, limited rear visibility, and the engine's somewhat underpowered feel for highway driving.

**Engine**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Some sources suggest the issue may be related to the rear shock absorbers or stabilizer bar links. Replacing these components may resolve the noise.

**Summary:**

The 2018 Toyota C-HR has a few recurring issues that potential buyers should be aware of. While some problems like infotainment glitches and suspension noises may be relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others such as excessive oil consumption or CVT issues can be more serious and costly. Overall, the C-HR is a generally reliable vehicle, but pre-purchase inspection focusing on these potential weak points is recommended.
