The 2021 Toyota C-HR is a subcompact SUV known for its distinctive styling, good fuel economy, and standard safety features. All 2021 C-HR models come with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 144 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While appreciated for its unique design and nimble handling, some owners have voiced concerns regarding the C-HR's limited cargo space and somewhat sluggish acceleration.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. The cause is not definitively pinpointed but often involves the piston rings.
    *   Solution: Oil consumption tests can determine the extent of the issue. Depending on the severity, repair options range from replacing the PCV valve to a more involved engine rebuild or replacement of piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted jerky acceleration, particularly at lower speeds, or hesitation when accelerating from a stop. This is often attributed to the CVT's programming and behavior.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) may improve the smoothness of the CVT. In more severe cases, CVT replacement may be necessary.

**Summary**

The 2021 Toyota C-HR generally has a good reputation for reliability, but some owners have experienced issues such as excessive oil consumption, CVT behavior quirks, and infotainment system glitches.
