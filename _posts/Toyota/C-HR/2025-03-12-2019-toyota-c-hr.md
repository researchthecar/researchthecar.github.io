The 2019 Toyota C-HR is a subcompact crossover known for its distinctive styling and good fuel economy. It comes with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 144 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate its unique design and nimble handling, while others dislike its limited cargo space and somewhat sluggish acceleration.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms may include the need to add oil every few thousand miles and potentially seeing blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and top off as needed. In severe cases, a dealer inspection may be required to determine the root cause. A compression test can help evaluate the engine's condition. If the piston rings are the cause, engine repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis - $100-$200. Piston ring replacement $2,000 - $4,000+. Engine replacement $4,000-$8,000+

**CVT**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like a momentary lag or a slight shudder.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can improve the CVT's performance. A CVT fluid change may also help. If the problem persists, internal CVT damage could be the cause, necessitating replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $100-$200. CVT Fluid Change $200-$400. CVT replacement: $4,000-$7,000
