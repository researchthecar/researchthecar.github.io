The 2006 Toyota Land Cruiser is a full-size SUV known for its reliability, off-road capability, and luxurious features. It comes with a single engine option, the 4.7L 2UZ-FE V8 engine producing 275 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its durability, comfort, and ability to handle tough terrain. Common complaints revolve around its fuel economy, size (making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces), and the age-related issues that come with owning an older vehicle.

**Engine**

**4.7L 2UZ-FE V8**

*   **Secondary Air Injection System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The secondary air injection system helps reduce emissions during cold starts. Components like the air injection pump and valves can fail, triggering the check engine light and potentially causing the vehicle to fail emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty components, such as the air injection pump or valves. Some owners choose to bypass the system, though this is not legal in all areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking/Leaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks can develop in the exhaust manifolds, leading to exhaust leaks. This results in a louder exhaust note, reduced engine performance, and potential for exhaust fumes to enter the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cracked exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve covers. The smell of burning oil may be present.
    * Solution: Replace valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Transmission**

**A750F 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially during light acceleration or when the torque converter is locking up. May also cause a check engine light to illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+

**Suspension**

*   **Height Control System (AHC) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Adjustable Height Control (AHC) system can develop leaks or fail to adjust properly, resulting in uneven vehicle height or a complete loss of height control.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the faulty AHC components, such as the accumulators, pump, or height sensors. Some owners opt to replace the AHC system with a traditional suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the failed components and repair approach)

*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging. Can happen on all sides or just one or two sides.
    * Solution: Replace leaking air struts or bags.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per strut

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system screen may fail, freeze, or become unresponsive. The GPS functionality may also be affected.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power door locks not working.
    * Solution: Replace faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust accumulation can occur, especially in regions with harsh winters where road salt is used. This can compromise the structural integrity of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Rust remediation through cleaning, treatment, and coating. In severe cases, frame repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5000+ (depending on severity)

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks can develop in the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates, due to sun exposure and temperature fluctuations.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the dashboard. Some owners use dashboard covers to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on repair method)

**Recalls:**

*   **05V482000:** Safety Recall B01 - Steering Intermediate Shaft
*   **05V224000:** Safety Recall A0J - Brake Master Cylinder

**Summary**

The 2006 Toyota Land Cruiser is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any older car, it's prone to certain issues. Problems with the AHC suspension and exhaust system can be expensive to repair, with costs potentially reaching into the thousands of dollars. Rust and electrical problems are also common concerns. While the Land Cruiser is known for its longevity, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs.
