**Summary**

The 2003 Toyota Land Cruiser is a highly capable and reliable vehicle, but it is not without its potential issues. The most common problems involve engine leaks (valve cover and timing cover), suspension issues (especially with the AHC system), rust, and electrical component failures. While some of these issues can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as AHC repairs or frame rust, can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and factor in potential repair costs when making a purchase. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs that can significantly impact the vehicle's reliability and safety.
