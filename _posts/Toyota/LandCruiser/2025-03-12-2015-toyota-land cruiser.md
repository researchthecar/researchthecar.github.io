**Summary**

The 2015 Toyota Land Cruiser, while generally reliable, can experience issues with its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and interior/exterior components. Engine issues such as air injection pump failure and valve cover gasket leaks can be costly to address. Transmission problems like torque converter shudder and harsh shifting can also arise. Suspension issues primarily concern the air suspension system (if equipped). Electrical problems can range from infotainment glitches to power seat motor failures. Rust on the undercarriage and interior cracking are also areas to inspect. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive to repair.
