The 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser marks the return of an iconic nameplate to the North American market. For this generation, the Land Cruiser is offered with a single engine option: the i-FORCE MAX 2.4L turbocharged four-cylinder hybrid engine, producing 326 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. It is paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Land Cruiser's rugged capabilities, retro styling, and Toyota's reputation for reliability. Common dislikes often revolve around the limited engine options, the removal of some of the more luxurious features found in previous generations, and the potential for long wait times due to high demand.
