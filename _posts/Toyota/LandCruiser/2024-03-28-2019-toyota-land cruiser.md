**Introduction**

The 2019 Toyota Land Cruiser is a full-size SUV that offers a combination of robust off-road capabilities and luxurious on-road comfort. It is powered by a 5.7-liter V8 engine that generates 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The Land Cruiser is available in two trim levels: SR5 and Limited.

Drivers appreciate the Land Cruiser's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and impressive off-road performance. However, it has drawn criticism for its high fuel consumption, dated infotainment system, and lack of modern safety features.
