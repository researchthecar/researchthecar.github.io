**Summary**

The 2017 Toyota Land Cruiser, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. Engine issues such as valve cover gasket leaks and water pump failures are relatively minor but can become costly if left unaddressed. Transmission harsh shifting can be resolved with a software update, but more serious cases might require a valve body replacement. Issues with the air suspension (if equipped) and electrical gremlins like battery drain can also be expensive to diagnose and repair. The interior issue of dashboard cracking is a common complaint and can be a costly repair. Overall, while the Land Cruiser maintains a strong reputation for reliability, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase. The majority of the issues range from minor annoyances to moderate repairs that do not generally affect the vehicle's overall dependability.
