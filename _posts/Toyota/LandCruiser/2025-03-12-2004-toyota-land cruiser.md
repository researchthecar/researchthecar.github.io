**Summary**

The 2004 Toyota Land Cruiser is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any older car, it is prone to certain issues. The most common problems revolve around engine leaks, exhaust manifold cracks, suspension (especially AHC) problems, rust, and electrical component failures. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for more extensive repairs like transmission work or AHC system overhaul. The severity of the issues is moderate, as most problems, if addressed promptly, will not leave you stranded. However, neglecting these issues can lead to more significant and costly damage over time.
