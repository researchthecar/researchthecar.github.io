**Introduction**

The 1999 Toyota Land Cruiser is a full-size SUV known for its ruggedness, reliability, and off-road capabilities. It is powered by a choice of two engines: a 4.7L V8 or a 4.2L inline-six diesel. The 4.7L V8 produces 230 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque, while the 4.2L diesel produces 135 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual.

**Engine**

**4.7L V8**

* **Head gasket failure:** Premature wear of the head gasket leading to coolant and oil leaks, overheating, and reduced engine performance. Solution: Replace the head gasket and inspect for any underlying causes of the failure. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Intake manifold gasket leakage:** Cracks or deterioration of the intake manifold gasket can cause vacuum leaks, rough idling, and reduced engine power. Solution: Replace the faulty gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to a noisy engine, reduced performance, and potential engine damage. Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner and inspect the timing chain for any damage. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+

**4.2L Diesel**

* **Fuel injector failure:** Malfunctioning fuel injectors can cause poor engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and excessive smoke. Solution: Replace the faulty injectors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail due to wear or a lack of proper lubrication, resulting in reduced engine power and increased exhaust smoke. Solution: Replace the faulty turbocharger. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip or hesitate during gear changes, especially when under load. Solution: Diagnose and repair the cause of the slippage, such as worn transmission components or a faulty torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch may wear out or develop slippage, causing difficulty shifting gears. Solution: Replace the clutch kit. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
* **Synchronizer wear:** Worn or damaged synchronizers can make shifting difficult or cause grinding noises. Solution: Replace the faulty synchronizers. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front ball joint failure:** Worn or damaged ball joints can lead to reduced steering precision, wandering on the road, and abnormal tire wear. Solution: Replace the faulty ball joints. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
* **Rear axle seal leakage:** Seals around the rear axle can fail, causing fluid leaks and potentially compromising the axle's integrity. Solution: Replace the faulty seals. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, leading to a loss of charging power and potential battery drain. Solution: Replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,000+
* **Starter failure:** A faulty starter can prevent the engine from starting. Solution: Replace the starter motor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** The Land Cruiser is prone to rust formation in areas such as the bumpers, fenders, and frame. Solution: Preventative measures include regular cleaning and rust protection treatments. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the extent of rust damage.

**Interior**

* **Power window switch failure:** The power window switches may fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. Solution: Replace the faulty switch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Dashboard lights dimming:** The dashboard lights may dim or fail due to electrical issues. Solution: Inspect the wiring harness and replace any faulty components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

**Summary**

The 1999 Toyota Land Cruiser is a generally reliable vehicle, but it is not immune to issues. While the severity of the problems can vary, some repairs can be costly.
