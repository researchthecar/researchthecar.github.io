The 2002 Toyota Land Cruiser is a full-size SUV known for its exceptional off-road capabilities, reliability, and luxurious features. The 2002 Land Cruiser was only offered with one engine option, the 4.7L 2UZ-FE V8 engine which produced 235 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. The 4.7L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically appreciate the Land Cruiser's dependability, comfortable ride, and ability to tackle challenging terrain. Some common dislikes include its relatively poor fuel economy and higher maintenance costs compared to some other SUVs.
