The 2023 Toyota Corolla is a popular compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and affordability. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 169 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. It is also available as a hybrid with a 1.8-liter inline-4 producing 138 horsepower. The non-hybrid is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the hybrid uses an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (eCVT). People like the Corolla for its fuel economy, reliability, and standard safety features. Some common dislikes include its somewhat uninspired driving experience and occasionally dated interior styling (depending on trim).

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than expected. This can manifest as a low oil level warning light or noticeable decrease in oil level on the dipstick between oil changes.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the severity. Initially, dealers may perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of consumption. If excessive consumption is confirmed, potential repairs include piston ring replacement or, in more severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
