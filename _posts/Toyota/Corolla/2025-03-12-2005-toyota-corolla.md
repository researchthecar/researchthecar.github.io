The 2005 Toyota Corolla is a compact sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. The standard engine is a 1.8-liter inline-4 (1ZZ-FE) producing 130 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Corolla's dependability, affordability, and fuel economy. Common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling and basic interior features.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FE Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2005 Corollas (and other models with the 1ZZ-FE engine) experience higher than normal oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

*   **Pre-Cat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter (located on the exhaust manifold) can degrade and its material can be sucked back into the engine, causing scoring of the cylinder walls and excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the pre-catalytic converter and addressing any engine damage, which may include a new engine or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 for the converter alone, $1500 - $4000+ for engine work.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report delayed or harsh shifting, particularly between gears. This can manifest as a noticeable jerk when shifting or a hesitation before engaging the next gear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the solenoids in the transmission or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-600 for solenoids, $2000 - $4000+ for transmission replacement.

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Coil Spring Sag/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear coil springs can sag over time or break, leading to a lower ride height in the rear, uneven tire wear, and a bouncy ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of one or more oxygen sensors (O2 sensors) can cause the check engine light to illuminate, reduced fuel economy, and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor(s). There are typically two O2 sensors: one upstream of the catalytic converter and one downstream.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking/Melting (Rare)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some Corollas, particularly in hot climates, have exhibited dashboard cracking or melting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

**Recalls:**
*   None Found

**Summary:**

The 2005 Toyota Corolla is generally a reliable vehicle, but some common issues exist. The most notable concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 1.8L engine, which can be expensive to fix. Transmission issues, while less common, can also lead to significant repair costs. Suspension issues are typically less severe and less costly to address. While a solid choice overall, a thorough inspection focusing on engine oil consumption and transmission performance is recommended when considering a used 2005 Corolla.
