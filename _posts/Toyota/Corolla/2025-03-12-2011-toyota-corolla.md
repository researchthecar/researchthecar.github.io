*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and visible blue smoke from the exhaust pipe.
    *   Solution: Toyota released a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) addressing this issue, which involves performing an oil consumption test. If the vehicle exceeds the specified oil consumption rate, the recommended repair is to replace the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump may fail prematurely, leading to coolant leaks and potential engine overheating. Symptoms include coolant dripping from the front of the engine, high engine temperature readings, and a sweet smell of coolant.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump and coolant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, especially between first and second gear. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds or when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and replacement can alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required to identify potential issues with the valve body or solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for fluid flush, $500 - $1,500+ for valve body or solenoid repair/replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, particularly if the vehicle is frequently loaded with cargo or passengers. This can lead to a rougher ride, reduced ground clearance, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shocks and springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Airbag Light On**

    *   Solution: Diagnose the airbag system using a scan tool to identify the specific fault code. Repair or replace the faulty sensor or wiring connection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the failed part
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clock Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clock spring, located in the steering column, can fail, causing issues with the horn, steering wheel-mounted audio controls, and airbag system.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000+, or $50 for a cover.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Toyota Corolla is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some common issues. The most prevalent problems seem to revolve around the engine (excessive oil consumption), the transmission (harsh shifting), and electrical components (airbag light, clock spring). While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as piston ring replacement or dashboard replacement, can be costly. Overall, the issues are fairly typical for a vehicle of this age and mileage, but potential buyers should be aware of them and factor them into their purchasing decision.
