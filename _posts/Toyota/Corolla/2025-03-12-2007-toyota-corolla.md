The 2007 Toyota Corolla is a compact sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. It comes with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 126 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission were the available transmission options. Owners often praise the Corolla for its dependability, fuel economy, and low running costs, while some dislike its somewhat bland styling and basic interior.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, where the engine burns more oil than normal. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and the need to add oil frequently between oil changes. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, low oil level warning light, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: A common fix is to replace the piston rings with an updated design that prevents excessive oil from entering the combustion chamber. In severe cases, the entire engine may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VVTi Gear Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or tapping noise coming from the engine, particularly during cold starts or at idle. This can be caused by wear or failure of the Variable Valve Timing (VVTi) actuator.
