## 2005 Toyota Corolla

The 2005 Toyota Corolla is a compact sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. It offers a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The engine produces 130 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque.

While the Corolla is generally a reliable vehicle, it has had some reported issues over the years.

**Engine**

* **1.8L 4-Cylinder Engine**
    * **Intake Valve Deposits:** Carbon buildup can form on the intake valves, leading to reduced engine performance and decreased fuel economy. This can be fixed by cleaning the valves. Estimated cost: $200 - $400.
    * **Oil Consumption:** Some engines may experience excessive oil consumption, especially on higher-mileage vehicles. This may require replacing the piston rings or valve stem seals. Estimated cost: $1,000 - $2,000.

**Transmission**

* **4-Speed Automatic Transmission**
    * **Shifting Issues:** Owners may experience hard or delayed shifting, especially when the transmission is cold. This could be caused by worn clutches or a faulty torque converter. Estimated cost: $800 - $1,500.
