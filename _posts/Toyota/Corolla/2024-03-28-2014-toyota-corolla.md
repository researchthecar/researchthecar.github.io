**2014 Toyota Corolla**

The 2014 Toyota Corolla is a compact sedan offered with three engine options: a 1.8L 4-cylinder (132 hp, 128 lb-ft torque), a 1.8L 4-cylinder with Valvematic (140 hp, 126 lb-ft torque), and a 2.4L 4-cylinder (158 hp, 162 lb-ft torque). Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic, a 6-speed manual, a CVT, and a 6-speed automatic.
