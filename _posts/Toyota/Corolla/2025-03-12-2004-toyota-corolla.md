**Summary**

The 2004 Toyota Corolla is a generally reliable vehicle but is prone to certain issues as it ages. The most significant problems are the 1ZZ-FE engine's oil consumption and the potential for rust. While repairs like headliner sagging or center console cracks are relatively minor, engine and transmission issues can be more costly. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of excessive oil consumption, rust, and transmission problems, and factor in potential repair costs.
