The 2017 Toyota Corolla is a popular compact car known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. It typically comes with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 132 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). A more fuel-efficient LE Eco trim offered a slightly different version of the 1.8-liter engine, producing 140 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the Corolla's dependability and good gas mileage, but some dislike its somewhat bland styling and less-than-exciting driving experience.
