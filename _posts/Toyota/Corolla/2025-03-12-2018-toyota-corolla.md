The 2018 Toyota Corolla is a compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and affordability. The standard engine is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder producing 132 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. A more efficient version of the same engine is also available which offers 140 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque. The primary transmission is a continuously variable transmission (CVT), though a six-speed manual was offered on the Corolla iM trim. Owners often praise the Corolla for its comfortable ride, spacious interior for its class, and excellent fuel economy. Common complaints include the somewhat uninspired driving experience and the basic interior materials.

**Summary**

The 2018 Toyota Corolla generally exhibits good reliability, but some common issues can arise. The excessive oil consumption in the 1.8L engine can be a costly repair if it requires piston ring replacement. CVT transmission issues, while not always severe, can affect the driving experience and could potentially lead to expensive replacements. Other reported problems such as the rear suspension noise and backup camera issues are typically less severe and less costly to resolve. The interior dashboard cracking is a common complaint and more of a cosmetic issue. While not every 2018 Corolla will experience these problems, being aware of them can help prospective buyers make an informed decision.
