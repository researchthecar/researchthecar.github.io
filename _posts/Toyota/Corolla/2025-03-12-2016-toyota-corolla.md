The 2016 Toyota Corolla is a compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and affordability. It comes with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 132 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. A slightly different version of the engine, rated at 140 horsepower, is used in the Corolla LE Eco trim. The standard transmission is a continuously variable transmission (CVT), though a six-speed manual was available on the Corolla iM hatchback. Owners generally appreciate the Corolla's fuel economy, comfortable ride, and reputation for longevity. Common complaints include the somewhat uninspired driving experience and basic interior features.
