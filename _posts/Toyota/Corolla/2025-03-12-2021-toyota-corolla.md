The 2021 Toyota Corolla is a popular compact sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and affordability. It typically comes with two engine options: a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 139 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 169 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Corolla for its comfortable ride, good gas mileage, and comprehensive safety features. Some common criticisms include the somewhat uninspired driving experience and the basic interior on lower trim levels.

**Engine**

**1.8L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potentially engine knocking or damage if the oil level is consistently low.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and potentially a more frequent oil change interval. A dealer inspection might be needed to check for leaks or internal engine issues. In severe cases, engine component replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for oil changes and top-offs) to $1000+ (for engine repairs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Four-Cylinder Engine**

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating. This can be caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the specific cylinder experiencing the misfire and replacing the faulty ignition coil or spark plug.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted a slight hesitation or jerking sensation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can feel like a stuttering or inconsistent power delivery.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a CVT fluid change is recommended. If the problem persists, internal CVT components may need inspection and repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or updating the infotainment software. If the problem persists, the head unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates/resets) to $500+ (for head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera. The screen may display a black image or distorted view when the vehicle is in reverse.
    * Solution: Checking the camera connections and wiring for damage. Replacing the backup camera unit if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Daytime Running Lights (DRL) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: One or both DRLs failing to illuminate, even though the headlights work properly.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty DRL bulb or LED unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and tightening loose trim pieces or applying sound-deadening material.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY fix) to $100-$300+ (professional repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Toyota Corolla is generally a reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with the engine (oil consumption and misfires), transmission (hesitation), electrical system (infotainment and backup camera), and interior (rattles). The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially more costly repairs. While some problems can be resolved with software updates or simple fixes, others may require more extensive mechanical work. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect any used Corolla before purchase.
