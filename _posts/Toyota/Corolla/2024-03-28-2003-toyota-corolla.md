**Introduction:**

The 2003 Toyota Corolla is a compact sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. It offers a choice between two engine options: a 1.8L inline-4 with 126 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3L inline-4 with 88 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic, a 5-speed manual, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Drivers appreciate the Corolla's comfortable interior and low operating costs, while some find its performance lacking.

**Engine**

* **1.8L Inline-4**

    * **Timing Belt Issue:** The timing belt may prematurely fail, causing the engine to lose power or experience catastrophic damage. Symptoms include a ticking or grinding noise from the engine, rough running, and power loss. The solution is to replace the timing belt and associated components, typically costing between $500 and $800+.
    * **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** The valve cover gasket may develop a leak, resulting in oil seepage or leaks around the valve cover. Symptoms include oil drips or a burning oil smell. The fix involves replacing the valve cover gasket, costing around $150 - $250+.

* **1.3L Inline-4**

    * **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

* **4-Speed Automatic**

    * **Transmission Slippage:** The transmission may slip or fail to engage gears, causing hesitation or loss of power. This issue may be caused by worn transmission components or solenoid failures. Solutions include transmission servicing, component replacement, or a full transmission rebuild, costing between $1,000 and $3,000+.
    * **Check Engine Light:** The check engine light may illuminate due to transmission-related issues, such as faulty sensors or electrical problems. The specific cause needs to be diagnosed and repaired, with costs varying depending on the issue.

* **5-Speed Manual**

    * **Shifting Difficulty:** The transmission may become difficult to shift, especially when cold. Worn or damaged shift linkage components or transmission mounts may be to blame. Replacing the affected parts or adjusting the linkage can resolve the issue, costing around $200 - $500+.

* **CVT**

    * **CVT Chain Failure:** The CVT chain may fail prematurely, leading to loss of power or transmission failure. Symptoms include a rattling or whining noise from the transmission and rough shifting. Replacing the CVT chain and associated components is the solution, which can cost between $2,000 and $4,000+.
