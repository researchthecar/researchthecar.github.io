**Introduction**

The 2016 Toyota Corolla is a compact sedan offered with three engine options: a 1.8-liter four-cylinder producing 132 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque, a 1.8-liter four-cylinder with Valvematic producing 140 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 169 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a six-speed manual, four-speed automatic, and continuously variable transmission (CVT).

Reviewers praise the Corolla for its fuel efficiency and reliability, but criticize it for its uninspiring interior and sluggish performance.
