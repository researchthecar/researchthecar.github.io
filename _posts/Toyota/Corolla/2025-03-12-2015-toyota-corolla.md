The 2015 Toyota Corolla is a compact sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. The standard engine is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 132 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. The Corolla LE Eco trim features a specially tuned version of the same 1.8-liter engine that delivers 140 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque, prioritizing fuel economy. Both engines are paired with either a six-speed manual transmission (limited availability) or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Corolla for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and excellent gas mileage. However, some criticisms include uninspired styling and a somewhat noisy CVT.
