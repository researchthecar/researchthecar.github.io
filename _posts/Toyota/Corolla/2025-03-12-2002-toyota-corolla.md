The 2002 Toyota Corolla is a compact sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. The most common engine option for the 2002 Corolla is the 1.8L 1ZZ-FE inline-4 engine, producing around 125 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque. Some drivers appreciate its simple and dependable nature, as well as its low running costs. Common dislikes include the car's uninspired styling and less-than-thrilling performance. All models came with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
