The 2024 Toyota Corolla is a popular compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It offers a comfortable ride and a suite of standard safety features. Some people find the Corolla's styling to be somewhat bland, and its base engine can feel underpowered for some drivers. The base engine is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder producing 139 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is available, producing 169 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). A hybrid version is also available, combining a 1.8-liter engine with an electric motor.
