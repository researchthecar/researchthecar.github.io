## 2023 Ford Bronco

The 2023 Ford Bronco is a rugged SUV that offers a blend of off-road capability and on-road comfort. It is available with two engine options: a 2.3L EcoBoost inline-4 that produces 300 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L EcoBoost V6 that produces 330 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.
