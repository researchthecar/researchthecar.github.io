### Summary Verdict
The 2002 GMC Safari is a generally dependable vehicle, particularly its powertrain. The 4.3L V6 engine and 4L60-E transmission are known for their longevity when properly maintained. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and, less commonly, cracked cylinder heads on the engine. Transmission-wise, torque converter and solenoid issues can arise. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and premature alternator failure are also noted. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, and interior HVAC blend door problems are common for vehicles of this age. Overall, with proactive maintenance and addressing these specific known issues, the 2002 Safari can remain a reliable workhorse or family van.
