The 2005 GMC Safari is a versatile and practical van known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and relatively simple mechanics. It was available with a single engine option: the 4.3L Vortec V6, which produced around 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission option was a 4-speed automatic (4L60E). Owners generally appreciate the Safari for its reliability, ease of maintenance, and ability to haul cargo or passengers. Downsides often cited include its fuel economy, somewhat dated interior, and potential for rust, especially in colder climates.

**Engine**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak near the front or rear of the engine, often resulting in overheating or coolant loss. May also lead to rough running or misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets with updated parts (often improved design).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+

*   **Distributor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, stalling, or failure to start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the distributor.

**Summary**

The 2005 GMC Safari, while generally a reliable van, can be prone to certain issues as it ages. Engine problems like intake manifold gasket leaks and distributor failure are common concerns. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60E, can be costly. Suspension wear and rust are also typical maintenance items. Overall, while repairs may be necessary, the Safari's simplicity and readily available parts make it a manageable vehicle to own, but be prepared for some potential expenses.
