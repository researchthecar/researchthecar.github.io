## The 2001 GMC Safari

The 2001 GMC Safari is a full-size van that was available with three different engine options: a 4.3L V6, a 4.8L V8, and a 5.7L V8. The 4.3L V6 produced 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, the 4.8L V8 produced 270 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and the 5.7L V8 produced 290 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. All three engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.
