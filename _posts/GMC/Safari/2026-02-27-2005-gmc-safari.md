### Summary Verdict
The 2005 GMC Safari is a capable utility vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 4.3L V6 engine can experience intake manifold gasket leaks and oil cooler line issues. The 4L60-E transmission, while generally durable, may develop torque converter clutch problems or solenoid failures. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can cause various malfunctions. Exterior rust is a concern, especially in humid or road-salt-prone areas. Interior climate control issues with blend door actuators and sagging headliners are also reported. Despite these potential problems, many Safaris have served reliably with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
