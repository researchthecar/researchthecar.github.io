The 2002 GMC Safari is a rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive passenger and cargo van that offers practicality and utility. The standard engine is a 4.3L Vortec V6 producing approximately 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Safari for its spacious interior, relatively compact size compared to full-size vans, and its ability to haul cargo or passengers. However, common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy for its size, dated interior features, and the age-related reliability issues typical of older vehicles.
