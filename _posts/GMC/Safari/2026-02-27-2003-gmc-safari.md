### Summary Verdict
The 2003 GMC Safari is a capable vehicle, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 4.3L V6 engine can develop intake manifold gasket leaks and distributor component wear. The 4L60-E transmission is prone to torque converter clutch issues and overheating. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling problems. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and premature alternator failure are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. Interior HVAC blend door actuators are a common failure point. Addressing these potential issues proactively can contribute to a more reliable ownership experience.
