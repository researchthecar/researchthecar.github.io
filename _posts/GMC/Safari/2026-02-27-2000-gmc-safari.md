### Summary Verdict
The 2000 GMC Safari is a capable utility vehicle, but its age means certain components are prone to failure. The 4.3L V6 engine can develop intake manifold gasket leaks and oil cooler line issues. Transmissions, particularly the 4L60-E, may experience torque converter or solenoid problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior wear, especially on seats and HVAC controls, is typical. Regular inspections and addressing these known issues proactively can help maintain the Safari's functionality.
