**Introduction**
The 1990 GMC R2500 Suburban is a full-size SUV that offered two engine options paired with two transmission options. The standard engine is a 5.7L V8 producing 210 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine is a 7.4L V8 producing 230 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission (4L80E) or a 5-speed manual transmission (NV4500).

The GMC R2500 Suburban is known for its spacious interior, powerful engines, and rugged durability. However, like all vehicles, it has its share of issues.

**Engine**

**5.7L V8**
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Failure of the gasket between the intake manifold and engine block, resulting in coolant and oil leaks, as well as reduced engine performance.
    * Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gasket
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Throttle position sensor (TPS) failure:** Malfunction of the TPS, causing erratic engine performance, idle issues, and stalling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the TPS
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
* **Distributor cap and rotor failure:** Worn or cracked distributor cap and rotor, leading to ignition problems, misfires, and engine stalling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the distributor cap and rotor
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+

**7.4L V8**
* **Excessive oil consumption:** Some 7.4L V8 engines may experience high oil consumption, requiring frequent oil changes to maintain proper levels.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn or damaged piston rings or valve seals
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Valve train noise:** Noisy valve train due to worn or damaged rocker arms, pushrods, or lifters.
    * Solution: Replacement of affected components
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

**Transmission**

**4L80E 4-Speed Automatic**
* **Torque converter shudder:** Vibration or shuddering during acceleration due to a worn or damaged torque converter.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Shift solenoid failure:** Malfunctioning shift solenoids, leading to transmission slipping, delayed or harsh shifts, and other shift-related issues.
    * Solution: Replacement of the shift solenoids
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**NV4500 5-Speed Manual**
* **Clutch failure:** Worn or damaged clutch disc or pressure plate, causing difficulty shifting, slippage, or chatter.
    * Solution: Replacement of the clutch
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
* **Synchronizer failure:** Worn or damaged synchronizers, resulting in grinding or difficulty shifting gears.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected synchronizers

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension coil spring failure:** Broken or collapsed coil springs in the front suspension, leading to reduced ride height and handling issues.
    * Solution: Replacement of the coil springs
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Rear leaf spring breakage:** Fatigue or overloading can cause the leaf springs in the rear suspension to break, leading to reduced load capacity and handling problems.
    * Solution: Replacement of the broken leaf springs
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** Malfunctioning alternator, resulting in insufficient charging of the battery and electrical system.
    * Solution: Replacement of the alternator
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Battery drain:** Parasitic draw on the battery, causing it to discharge when the vehicle is turned off.
    * Solution: Identifying and eliminating the source of the battery drain
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the source

**Exterior**

* **Rust and corrosion:** Some GMC R2500 Suburbans may experience rust and corrosion on the body panels, frame, and undercarriage.
    * Solution: Regular maintenance, rust prevention measures, and repairs as needed
