The 2003 GMC W3500 Forward is a cab-over-engine (COE) medium-duty truck often used for delivery, utility, and service applications. The most common engine is the 5.7L Vortec V8, producing approximately 275 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. A 7.4L gas engine, a 6.6L Duramax Diesel, and a 7.8L Isuzu Diesel engine were also available for select models. Transmission options were primarily a 4-speed automatic (4L80E for gasoline engines) or a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the truck's maneuverability and tight turning radius, which is beneficial in urban environments. However, the COE design results in a bumpier ride compared to conventional trucks, and access to the engine for maintenance can be challenging.

**Summary**

The 2003 GMC W3500 Forward is generally a reliable work truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine issues such as intake manifold leaks (5.7L Vortec) and fuel injector problems (6.6L Duramax) can be costly to repair. Transmission problems with the 4L80E can also be significant. Suspension and electrical issues are common and can add to the overall cost of ownership. Rust is also a major concern. While the truck is valued for its maneuverability, these potential repairs should be considered when evaluating a purchase.
