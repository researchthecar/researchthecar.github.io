The 2001 GMC W3500 Forward is a medium-duty cab-over truck often used for delivery services, landscaping, and other commercial applications. It's appreciated for its maneuverability in tight spaces and its relatively high payload capacity. However, it is now an older vehicle, meaning reliability and availability of parts can be concerns. Dislikes often include the utilitarian interior and ride comfort, which are typical for a commercial vehicle. For the 2001 model year, the primary engine option was the Isuzu 4HE1-TC 4.8L Turbo Diesel inline-4 engine, producing around 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. The main transmission option was the Aisin A465 4-speed automatic transmission. There were few optional configurations.

**Summary**

The 2001 GMC W3500 Forward, while a practical workhorse, is prone to issues related to its age and heavy-duty use. Engine and transmission problems are common, particularly with the turbocharger, injectors, and shifting. Suspension components wear out quickly due to the vehicle's load capacity. Electrical issues related to wiring and corrosion are also frequently reported. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls. Rust is a major concern depending on geographic location, and can become a substantial expense to properly address.
