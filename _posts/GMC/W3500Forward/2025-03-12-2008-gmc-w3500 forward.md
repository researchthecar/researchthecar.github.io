However, some common complaints include the cost of parts and service specific to Isuzu-sourced components, as well as some electronic reliability issues.

**Engine**

**5.2L Isuzu 4HK1-TC Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, excessive smoke (black or white), poor fuel economy, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed. Injectors are prone to failure due to fuel contamination or wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty injectors. It's recommended to replace all injectors at once for balanced performance and to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$800+ per injector (parts and labor).

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, whistling or grinding noises from the turbocharger, and potentially an illuminated check engine light.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Ensure proper oil supply to the new turbo to prevent premature failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500-$3000+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, poor acceleration, increased emissions, and a check engine light. The EGR valve can become clogged with carbon deposits.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body repair/replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid/filter), $500-$1500 (valve body), $3000-$5000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000-$2500+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sag/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, poor ride quality, reduced load capacity, and potential cracking or breaking of leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the truck is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per side (parts and labor)
