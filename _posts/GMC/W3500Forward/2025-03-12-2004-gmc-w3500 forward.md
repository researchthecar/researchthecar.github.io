The 2004 GMC W3500 Forward is a cab-over-engine (COE) medium-duty truck popular for its maneuverability and relatively compact size, making it suitable for urban delivery and service applications. The primary engine option for this model year was the Isuzu 4HE1-TC 4.8L turbocharged diesel engine, producing approximately 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. While drivers often praise the truck's visibility, ease of parking, and tight turning radius, common complaints revolve around parts availability (as these are often specific to Isuzu-built trucks), and general maintenance due to the cab-over design. Other engines available were the Isuzu 4BD2T 3.9L Turbo Diesel rated at 130 hp and the Isuzu 6BG1 6.5L Diesel rated at 185 hp. Transmission options were typically Isuzu manual or Aisin automatic transmissions depending on the specific configuration.

**Summary**

The 2004 GMC W3500 Forward, while a capable and practical medium-duty truck, can be prone to issues related to its age and diesel engine. The Isuzu 4HE1-TC engine can suffer from turbocharger and fuel injector issues, while the Aisin automatic transmission can experience shifting problems. Suspension and electrical issues are also common. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the specific problem, but owners should be prepared for potentially higher costs due to the truck's commercial nature and potential parts availability challenges. Rust, particularly in areas like cab mounts, needs to be carefully inspected. Addressing these issues promptly can help ensure the longevity and reliability of the vehicle.
