The 2000 GMC W3500 Forward is a cab-over-engine (COE) medium-duty truck popular for its maneuverability and relatively compact size, making it suitable for urban delivery and service applications. In 2000, the W3500 was primarily offered with a 5.7L Vortec V8 gasoline engine producing approximately 190 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. While a diesel option was available in other years, it was not available for the 2000 model. Users generally appreciate the truck's tight turning radius and ease of operation in congested areas. Some common complaints include the truck's older design and associated maintenance demands.

**Engine**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak externally (often seen dripping near the rear of the engine), rough idle, and potential overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket with an updated version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

    *   Description/Symptoms: The leaf springs, particularly in the rear, are prone to sagging over time, especially when regularly loaded near the vehicle's GVWR. This can lead to a reduced ride height, poor handling, and bottoming out.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if the vehicle frequently carries heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ (depending on spring type and labor)

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion and brittle wiring are common in older vehicles. This can lead to various electrical problems, including intermittent lights, sensor failures, and starting issues.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair or replace damaged sections of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the extent of the damage)

*   **Alternator Failure**
