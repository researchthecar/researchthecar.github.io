### Summary Verdict
The 2016 GMC Sierra 1500 demonstrates generally good reliability, particularly with its larger V8 engines. The most frequently reported issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the 5.3L V8, leading to potential lifter problems and oil consumption. Transmission issues, while not widespread, can include torque converter shudder in the 6-speed automatic. Electrical concerns are mostly limited to infotainment system glitches and occasional Body Control Module (BCM) issues. Exterior and interior components show minor concerns like sticking tailgates and seat heater failures. Overall, the Sierra 1500 is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the AFM system's known issues and consider vehicles with the 6.2L V8 or the 8-speed transmission for potentially fewer engine/transmission-related concerns.
