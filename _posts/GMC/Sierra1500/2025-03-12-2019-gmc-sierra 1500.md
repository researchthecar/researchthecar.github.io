The 2019 GMC Sierra 1500 marked the start of a new generation, offering a more refined and technologically advanced pickup truck. Available engine options included a 2.7L Turbo I4 (310 hp, 348 lb-ft torque), a 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 (285 hp, 305 lb-ft torque), a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft torque), and a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft torque). Transmissions varied by engine, including 6-speed, 8-speed, and 10-speed automatics. Owners often praised the Sierra's improved interior styling, advanced technology features (like the MultiPro tailgate), and strong performance. However, some common complaints included the functionality of the transmission, excessive vibration issues, and reliability concerns with certain components.

**Engine**

**2.7L Turbo I4**

*   **Piston Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracked or failed pistons can cause excessive oil consumption, rough running, engine knocking, and potentially catastrophic engine failure. Often happens between 30,000 - 50,000 miles.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected pistons or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, the AFM system on the 6.2L can also lead to lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough running, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, and sometimes the camshaft. Disabling the AFM system with a tuner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+

**Summary**

The 2019 GMC Sierra 1500, while representing a significant redesign, has several common issues. The most concerning issues involve the engine (particularly piston and lifter failures), and transmission (harsh shifting). Electrical gremlins and dashboard cracks also appeared frequently. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences like infotainment glitches to major expenses like engine replacement. Estimated repair costs can vary widely, with engine and transmission repairs potentially costing several thousand dollars. The AFM issues in the 5.3L and 6.2L V8 engines are especially prevalent, highlighting the importance of researching preventative measures like AFM disablers. While the truck offers many appealing features, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and budget accordingly.
