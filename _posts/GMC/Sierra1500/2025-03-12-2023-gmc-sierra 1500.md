**Engine**

**2.7L Turbo High-Output I4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illumination. These can be due to faulty spark plugs or coil packs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the spark plugs and/or faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ depending on the number of coil packs needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, loss of power, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, check engine light. This issue stems from the AFM system that deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty lifters, potentially requiring removal of the cylinder heads.  Many owners choose to delete the AFM system entirely during repair to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (depending on AFM delete)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a redesigned valve cover has resolved the issue.  More severe cases may require piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, this engine also experiences AFM lifter failure, leading to ticking noises, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty lifters, potentially requiring removal of the cylinder heads.  Many owners choose to delete the AFM system entirely during repair to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (depending on AFM delete)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I6**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine power, messages related to DEF levels or quality. This can involve the DEF injector, pump, or sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing the faulty component within the DEF system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on how many injectors need to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.7L Turbo)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, particularly at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: Software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM). If that doesn't work, valve body replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,500+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic (Paired with 5.3L, 6.2L, and 3.0L Duramax)**

*   **Shuddering/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or hesitation, especially during light acceleration or when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: A triple flush of the transmission fluid with a specific updated fluid is a first step. Valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be required in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $6,000+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A delay when shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse.
    *   Solution: Software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) or valve body replacement.

**Summary:**

The 2023 GMC Sierra 1500 can experience a range of issues, with the engine and transmission being the most problematic areas. The AFM lifter failures in the V8 engines can be a significant and costly repair. The 10-speed transmission is also prone to shuddering and hesitation, requiring expensive repairs in some cases. Electrical issues, specifically with the infotainment system, can also be frustrating. While some issues are minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be severe and lead to considerable repair bills.
