**Engine**

**4.3L V6 (LU3)**
*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, rough running engine, white smoke from exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.8L V8 (LR4)**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil usage between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, fouled spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Potential solutions range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, with the latter being more involved and expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8 (LM7/L59)**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil usage between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, fouled spark plugs. The AFM/DOD system, although not present on the 2003 models, laid the groundwork for oil consumption issues in later years, as these engines were prone to piston ring issues that caused oil to seep into the combustion chamber.
    *   Solution: Potential solutions range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, with the latter being more involved and expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at highway speeds. Can also manifest as a complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifts between gears, noticeable delays when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Often caused by worn valve body components or low transmission fluid. A fluid flush and filter change may help, but valve body replacement might be necessary.

**Summary:**

The 2003 GMC Sierra 1500 has a mix of common issues. Engine oil consumption (especially in the V8 models) and transmission problems with the 4L60E are prevalent and can be costly. Suspension wear and electrical glitches also occur. Rust is a major concern for this age of vehicle, especially in areas with road salt. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be significant, making a thorough inspection crucial before purchasing.
