### Summary Verdict
The 2002 GMC Sierra 3500 is a capable and generally reliable heavy-duty truck, especially for its intended purpose of hauling and towing. The gasoline Vortec V8 engines are known for their power, though intake manifold gasket leaks and oil cooler line issues can occur. The Duramax diesel, while powerful, is prone to injector line failures and glow plug problems, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions, particularly the Allison 1000, can experience torque converter issues, while manual transmissions may develop synchronizer wear. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear given the truck's duty cycle. Electrical issues, such as alternator failures, are not uncommon with age. Rust can be a concern on exterior panels. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing known issues, the 2002 Sierra 3500 remains a durable option, but potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas.
