The 2002 GMC Sierra 3500 is a heavy-duty truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Available engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8, the 8.1L Vortec V8, and the 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8. The Vortec 6000 produced around 300 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque. The Sierra 3500 is liked for its robust build, workhorse performance, and relative simplicity compared to modern trucks. Some common complaints include the age-related wear and tear typical of a vehicle this old, fuel economy (especially with the larger gas engines), and certain maintenance quirks.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, overheating, and rough running engine. This could lead to engine damage if ignored.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous or zero oil pressure readings on the gauge. This can cause unnecessary worry or, worse, mask an actual oil pressure problem.
    *   Solution: Replacing the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+

**8.1L Vortec V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolt Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leaks, ticking noise (especially when cold), reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Removing broken bolts and installing new bolts and exhaust manifold gaskets. This can be difficult due to corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (LB7)**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: White smoke, rough idle, fuel in the oil, and decreased fuel economy. The LB7 engine is particularly known for injector failures.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty injectors. Often all eight are replaced at once to avoid future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls:

**Summary**

The 2002 GMC Sierra 3500, while a capable truck, is showing its age. The most significant issues revolve around the Duramax diesel engine (specifically injector failure), transmission problems (especially with the Allison 1000), and rust. Injector replacements on the Duramax can be costly. Suspension and electrical issues are also common. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like transmission rebuilds or extensive rust repair, can be major expenses. Buyers should carefully inspect these trucks for these common problems and factor potential repairs into their budget.
