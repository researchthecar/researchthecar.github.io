**Summary**

The 2001 GMC Sierra 3500, while a capable and durable truck, is subject to several common issues due to its age. Engine-related problems, particularly fuel injector issues with the Duramax diesel and intake manifold leaks in the gasoline engines, can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L80E, are also prevalent. Suspension components wear out over time, and electrical problems can be frustrating. Rust is a significant concern in certain climates. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. Early models with the LB7 Duramax will need to have the fuel injectors replaced. It is recommended to replace all of them at once.
