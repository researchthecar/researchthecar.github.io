## 2007 GMC W4500 Forward

The 2007 GMC W4500 Forward is a heavy-duty commercial truck offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. It is known for its durability, reliability, and towing and hauling capabilities. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of issues.

**Engine**

**8.1L V8 (Vortec 8100)**

* **Lifter failure:** Lifters in the engine can fail, causing a ticking or knocking noise. The engine may also experience a loss of power. Solution: Replace the lifters. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Intake manifold gasket leak:** The intake manifold gasket can leak, causing a loss of coolant and vacuum. Symptoms may include a coolant leak, a decrease in engine power, and a rough idle. Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Fuel injector failure:** Fuel injectors can fail, causing the engine to run rough or stall. Symptoms may include a loss of power, a rough idle, and difficulty starting the engine. Solution: Replace the fuel injectors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**6.6L Duramax V8 Diesel**

* **EGR valve failure:** The EGR valve can fail, causing a loss of power, a decrease in fuel economy, and increased emissions. Solution: Replace the EGR valve. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail, causing a loss of power and increased exhaust smoke. Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
* **Fuel pump failure:** The fuel pump can fail, causing the engine to stall or run poorly. Symptoms may include a loss of power, difficulty starting the engine, and a decrease in fuel economy. Solution: Replace the fuel pump. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 5-speed Automatic**

* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing a loss of power, a rough shift, and increased transmission noise. Solution: Replace the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Overheating:** The transmission can overheat, causing a loss of power, a delayed shift, and increased transmission noise. Solution: Replace the transmission cooler or rebuild the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
* **Shift solenoid failure:** The shift solenoid can fail, causing a delayed shift or no shift at all. Solution: Replace the shift solenoid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Allison 2000 6-speed Automatic**

* **Hard shifting:** The transmission may shift hard, causing a jolt or jerk. Solution: Adjust the transmission shift cable or rebuild the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Slipping:** The transmission may slip, causing a loss of power or acceleration. Solution: Replace the transmission friction plates or rebuild the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **No reverse gear:** The transmission may not engage in reverse gear. Solution: Replace the reverse gear planetary gearset or rebuild the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension wear:** The front suspension components, such as ball joints, tie rods, and bushings, can wear out over time. This can lead to a loss of steering control, a rough ride, and increased tire wear. Solution: Replace the worn suspension components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
* **Rear suspension overload:** The rear suspension can overload, causing the truck to sag and the tires to wear unevenly. Solution: Install helper springs or upgrade the rear suspension. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

**Electrical**

* **Battery failure:** The battery can fail, causing the truck to not start. Solution: Replace the battery. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to drain and the truck to not start. Solution: Replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Starter failure:** The starter can fail, causing the truck to not start. Solution: Replace the starter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** The body and frame can rust over time, especially in areas with high humidity or salt. Solution: Repair or replace the rusted components. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the severity of the rust.
* **Headlight failure:** The headlights can fail, reducing nighttime visibility. Solution: Replace the headlights. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Interior**

* **Radio failure:** The radio can fail, losing functionality or producing no sound. Solution: Replace the radio. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Heater/AC failure:** The heater or AC system can fail, causing the interior to be too hot or cold. Solution: Repair or replace the heater/AC components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
* **Cruise control failure:** The cruise control system can fail, preventing the driver from maintaining a constant speed. Solution: Replace the cruise control module or switch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Summary**

The 2007 GMC W4500 Forward is a capable and reliable commercial truck. However, it is not without its issues. Some of the more common problems include lifter failure, intake manifold gasket leaks, and fuel injector failure. Transmission issues can also occur, such as torque converter failure, overheating, and shift solenoid failure. The suspension, electrical system, and interior components can also experience problems over time. Overall, the severity and cost of the issues can vary, so it is important to have the truck regularly inspected and maintained to minimize the risk of costly repairs.
