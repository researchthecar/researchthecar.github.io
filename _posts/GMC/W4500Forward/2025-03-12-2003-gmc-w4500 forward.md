The 2003 GMC W4500 Forward is a medium-duty cab-over truck popular for its maneuverability and reliability in commercial applications. It was commonly equipped with a 4.8L Isuzu 4HE1-TC turbocharged diesel engine, which produced approximately 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. Some models may have also been available with a 4.8L Isuzu 4HK1-TC engine (though this was more common in later years). Both engines were typically paired with an Aisin A465 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the W4500 for its ease of use in urban environments, good fuel economy (for its class), and robust chassis. Common complaints include the relatively noisy cab, some maintenance difficulties due to the cab-over design, and the age of some components in older models.

**Engine**

**4.8L Isuzu 4HE1-TC Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, excessive smoke (white or black), poor fuel economy, and potential engine misfires. Often diagnosed with a diagnostic scanner showing codes related to injector performance.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure balanced performance and avoid future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+ (depending on labor and parts costs).
