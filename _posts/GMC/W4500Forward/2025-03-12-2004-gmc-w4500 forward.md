The 2004 GMC W4500 Forward is a cab-over medium-duty truck popular for its maneuverability and payload capacity. The most common engine option for this model year is the Isuzu 4.8L 4HE1-TC turbocharged diesel engine, producing around 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include the Isuzu 4.8L 4HE1 and the 5.7L Vortec gas engine. Transmission options were typically the Aisin A465 4-speed automatic, and the Isuzu MZZ6 5-speed manual. Owners often appreciate the truck's tight turning radius and reliability, but some dislike the cab's spartan interior and the limited availability of certain replacement parts.
