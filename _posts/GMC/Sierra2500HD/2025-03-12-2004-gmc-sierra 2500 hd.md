The 2004 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a popular heavy-duty truck known for its towing capacity and reliability. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque), the 8.1L Vortec V8 (340 hp, 455 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (300 hp, 520 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were the 4L80E four-speed automatic (with the 6.0L gas engine) and the Allison 1000 five-speed automatic (with the 8.1L gas engine and the 6.6L Duramax diesel). Owners generally appreciate the truck's ruggedness and capabilities, but some common complaints involve electrical gremlins and driveline issues, especially as the vehicles age.
