The 2014 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8 engine (397 hp, 765 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sierra 2500 HD for its robust build quality, strong engine performance, and comfortable ride for a heavy-duty truck. However, some common complaints include issues with the emissions system on the diesel engine, electrical glitches, and premature wear of certain suspension components.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, misfires, reduced power, check engine light. Often occurs around 100,000 miles.
    *   Solution: Replace all AFM lifters with updated non-AFM lifters and replace the camshaft if damaged. Disable AFM via tuning to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Burning oil, low oil level warnings, smoky exhaust, primarily occurs at higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace valve seals, piston rings or short block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (LML)**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent regenerations, reduced engine power, check engine light, "Keep Driving Until Exhaust Filter is Clear" message.
    *   Solution: Attempt a forced regeneration. If unsuccessful, replace the DPF. Upstream sensors such as the DEF injector and NOx sensors may also need to be inspected and replaced if they are causing the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (DPF replacement), $200-$1000+ (sensor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, white smoke, fuel knock, reduced power. Can lead to cylinder washdown if not addressed quickly.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injector(s). Inspect and replace fuel lines and fittings as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+ (depending on how many are replaced and if damage has been done to the engine)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine won't start, rough running, metallic debris in fuel system. This pump is known to grenade and send metal debris into the whole fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replace CP4 pump with CP3 pump for a more robust fuel system. Flush and clean the entire fuel system including injectors and fuel lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during lockup, slipping, abnormal transmission temperatures, complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Inspect transmission for internal damage and rebuild if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Flare**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission RPMs rise noticeably between shifts. Often more prevalent on the 3-4 shift.
    *   Solution: Replace valve body, re-sleeve the valve body, or replace the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Upper Control Arm Ball Joint Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noise from front suspension, loose steering, uneven tire wear, possible ball joint separation.
    *   Solution: Replace upper control arms with new ball joints. Inspect other suspension components for wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load capacity, rough ride.
    *   Solution: Replace leaf springs or add helper springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues such as power windows not working, door locks malfunctioning, lights flickering, or the radio cutting out.
    *   Solution: Replace the BCM. Reprogramming may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Four Wheel Drive (4WD) Actuator Failure**

**Summary**

The 2014 GMC Sierra 2500 HD, while a capable truck, has its share of common issues. The most concerning are the potential for significant engine and transmission problems, particularly with the Duramax diesel's emissions system and fuel pump. The gasoline engine's AFM lifter failure and oil consumption are also significant potential expenses. Electrical and suspension issues are less costly but still fairly common. Buyers should thoroughly inspect any potential purchase, especially for rust, and budget for potential repairs.
