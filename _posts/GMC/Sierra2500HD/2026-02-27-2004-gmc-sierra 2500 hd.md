### Summary Verdict
The 2004 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a capable truck, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues, particularly with the Duramax diesel engine's injectors and glow plugs, and the gasoline V8s' intake manifold gaskets. Transmission issues, especially with the Allison 1000, can arise, often related to overheating or solenoids. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM problems, and suspension wear like ball joints are also points to consider. Rust is a significant concern for trucks in certain climates. Despite these potential drawbacks, many of these issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, allowing the Sierra 2500 HD to remain a reliable workhorse.
