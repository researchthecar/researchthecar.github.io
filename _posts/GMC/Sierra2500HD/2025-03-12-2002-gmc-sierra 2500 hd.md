The 2002 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse nature. It offers a few different engine options, including the 6.0L Vortec V8, the 8.1L Vortec V8, and the legendary 6.6L Duramax diesel. The 6.0L Vortec V8 produced around 300 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque. The Duramax was a popular choice for its towing prowess and longevity, but owners sometimes find them aging on them. Others appreciate the Sierra's simple, rugged design and strong payload and towing capacity, while some dislike its dated interior and ride quality compared to newer trucks. Transmission options included the Allison 1000 5-speed automatic (primarily paired with the Duramax) and the 4L80E 4-speed automatic (typically with the gasoline engines).

**Summary:** The 2002 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues, especially given its age. Engine issues, particularly fuel injector problems in the Duramax diesel, can be quite expensive. Suspension and electrical problems are also common. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds or engine work, can be costly. Before purchasing, a thorough inspection is recommended, focusing on the areas mentioned above.
