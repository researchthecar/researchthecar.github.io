The 2024 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing capacity, powerful engine options, and available luxury features. Engine options include a 6.6L gasoline V8 producing 401 horsepower and 464 lb-ft of torque and a 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8 producing 470 horsepower and 975 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed Allison automatic transmission.
