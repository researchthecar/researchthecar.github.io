The 2019 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. It offered two engine options: a 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine producing 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8 engine producing 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of torque. The gasoline engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel engine was paired with an Allison 1000 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sierra 2500 HD's robust power, comfortable ride for a heavy-duty truck, and available technology features. However, some common complaints revolve around reliability issues and certain interior material choices.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. The AFM lifters are known to fail, causing a ticking noise from the engine, rough running, misfires, and potentially significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, sometimes due to issues with the piston rings.
    *   Solution: Involves replacing the piston rings, which is a labor-intensive job. Some owners report using thicker oil as a temporary fix, but this doesn't address the underlying problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax (L5P)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and black smoke from the exhaust. Can also lead to a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per injector (depending on location and diagnostic costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CP4 fuel pump is known to be problematic, especially when contaminated fuel is used. Failure of the pump can send metal debris throughout the fuel system, causing widespread damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CP4 pump and potentially the fuel injectors, fuel lines, and fuel tank if contamination occurred. Some owners preemptively replace the CP4 with a more robust CP3 pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ (for full fuel system replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed (Paired with 6.6L Duramax)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially during light acceleration or while towing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter and flushing the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.0L Vortec)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, or the transmission slipping out of gear.
    *   Solution: Can be caused by low fluid, valve body issues, or internal damage. Requires diagnosis and repair or replacement of the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (for minor repairs) - $4,000+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Alignment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature tire wear, pulling to one side, or a crooked steering wheel.
    *   Solution: Performing a proper front end alignment. Some owners report needing to do this more frequently than expected.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Weak Leaf Springs**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, especially when towing or hauling heavy loads.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with heavier duty versions.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, Crashing, or Failing to Connect to Bluetooth Devices.
    *   Solution: Update the software, replace the unit if problems persist.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Can range from TPMS sensor failures to O2 sensor issues, leading to check engine lights and inaccurate readings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, depending on the type and location
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Wheel Arch Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the wheel arches, especially in areas with harsh winters and road salt.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the rusted panels, and applying rust protection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Third Brake Light Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cab through the third brake light housing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the third brake light assembly and sealing it properly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters not working or working intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating element or control module.

**Summary**

The 2019 GMC Sierra 2500 HD can be a reliable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The most serious and costly problems often involve the engine (especially the AFM lifters and CP4 pump) and transmission. Electrical and interior issues, while less severe, can still be annoying. Pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended, particularly to check for signs of lifter failure, fuel system issues, and transmission problems. Costs can vary widely, with some repairs being relatively minor and others requiring major engine or transmission work.
