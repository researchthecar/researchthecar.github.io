The 2009 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. It was available with three engine options: a 6.0L Vortec gasoline V8 (360 hp, 380 lb-ft torque), a 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8 (365 hp, 660 lb-ft torque), and an 8.1L Vortec gasoline V8. The 6.0L gasoline engine was paired with a 4L80E 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.6L Duramax diesel and 8.1L gasoline engines were paired with the Allison 1000 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Sierra 2500 HD for its robust powertrain and ability to handle tough jobs. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engines), and certain maintenance issues detailed below.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec Gasoline V8**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often noticed as the need to add oil between changes. This is often caused by worn valve stem seals or piston rings. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust, especially upon startup.
    * Solution: Replacement of valve stem seals and/or piston rings. An engine rebuild may be necessary in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts, resulting in an exhaust leak. This can cause a ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold.
    * Solution: Replacement of broken exhaust manifold bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold itself if warped.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbodiesel V8 (LMM)**

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, white smoke from the exhaust, and reduced fuel economy. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) related to fuel injector performance are common.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ (per injector)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Glow Plug Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather.  Diagnostic Trouble Codes related to glow plug performance are common.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty glow plug(s) and glow plug controller if needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR System Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check Engine Light, reduced engine performance, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential overheating. EGR valve clogging or EGR cooler leaks are common issues.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve, repairing or replacing the EGR cooler.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec Gasoline V8**

* **Knocking Noise/Piston Slap**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable knocking or slapping sound from the engine, particularly when cold. Can be caused by piston slap due to excessive piston-to-cylinder clearance.
    * Solution: Engine rebuild or replacement.  Thicker oil may temporarily reduce the noise, but is not a long-term solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic (paired with 6.6L Duramax and 8.1L Vortec)**

* **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during TCC engagement, slipping, and potential for overheating. DTCs related to TCC performance are common.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Upgraded torque converters are available for improved durability.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Internal Clutch Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping, harsh shifting, or complete loss of gear engagement.  Often caused by worn clutch packs within the transmission.
    * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Shift Solenoid Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, failure to shift into certain gears, or harsh shifting.  Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to shift solenoid performance are common.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty shift solenoid(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

**4L80E 4-Speed Automatic (paired with 6.0L Vortec)**

* **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, especially when accelerating. Harsh or delayed shifts can also occur.
    * Solution: Often requires a transmission rebuild or replacement due to worn clutches or other internal components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially during lockup. Can also cause overheating and damage to the transmission.
