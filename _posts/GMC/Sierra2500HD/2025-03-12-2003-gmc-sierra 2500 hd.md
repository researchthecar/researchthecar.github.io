In summary, the 2003 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a workhorse of a truck, but owners should be aware of common issues. The Duramax diesel engine, while powerful, is prone to expensive fuel injector failures, while other engines can experience oil consumption and exhaust leaks. Transmission issues can also be costly. Suspension components like pitman/idler arms and ball joints tend to wear out. Electrical problems such as instrument cluster and 4WD actuator failures are also fairly common. Rust is a significant concern in some regions. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and budget for potential repairs. Costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work.
