The 2008 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a popular heavy-duty truck known for its towing capacity and durability. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (353 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque), the 8.1L Vortec V8 (325 hp and 447 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (365 hp and 660 lb-ft of torque). Transmission choices were either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed Allison automatic. Owners often praise the Sierra 2500 HD for its workhorse capabilities, comfortable ride (for a heavy-duty truck), and relatively simple maintenance. Common complaints include fuel economy (especially with the gas engines), some electrical gremlins, and the overall size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Summary**

The 2008 GMC Sierra 2500 HD can be a reliable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The Duramax diesel, while powerful, can suffer from expensive fuel injector and turbocharger issues. The 6.0L gas engine can consume oil. Electrical gremlins stemming from the BCM are another potential headache. Rust is a concern in certain climates. Overall, the severity and cost of repairs can range from relatively minor to significant, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing.
