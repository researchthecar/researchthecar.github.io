### Summary Verdict
The 2015 GMC Sierra 2500 HD generally offers good reliability, especially with the gasoline 6.0L V8 engine and the 6L90 transmission, which show no widespread significant issues. The Duramax diesel engine, while powerful, can be prone to Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) regeneration problems and glow plug failures, particularly with extensive short-trip driving or if maintenance is neglected. The Allison transmission, while robust, may occasionally exhibit torque converter shudder. Electrical systems can sometimes suffer from battery drain issues. Overall, for a heavy-duty truck, the Sierra 2500 HD is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific concerns related to the diesel powertrain and transmission.
