Alright, here's the breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2016 GMC Sierra 2500 HD, formatted as requested. The 2016 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing capacity and workhorse capabilities. Engine options include a 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.6L Duramax diesel V8 (397 hp and 765 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the truck's powerful engine options and towing capabilities but often cite ride quality and some reliability issues as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**
*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, ticking noises from the engine, and potential catastrophic engine damage. Often occurs at higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed AFM lifters and potentially the camshaft if it has been damaged. Some owners choose to disable AFM to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (LML)**

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls, hard starts, no starts, check engine light. The CP4 pump is known for its sensitivity to fuel quality, and failures can send metal debris throughout the fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replace the CP4 pump, fuel injectors, fuel lines, and potentially the fuel tank. Some owners upgrade to a more robust fuel pump system (e.g., a CP3 conversion).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine power, DEF level sensor malfunction, clogged DEF injector. The DEF system is prone to crystallization and sensor failures.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty DEF sensor, DEF injector, or DEF pump. Cleaning the DEF system components may provide a temporary fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.6L Duramax)**
*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, especially during light acceleration in higher gears.
    *   Solution: Perform a triple flush of the transmission fluid, and add a friction modifier additive. A replacement of the torque converter may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$300 (fluid flush and additive), $1,000 - $2,500+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6L90 6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.0L Vortec)**
*   **Harsh Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abnormally harsh or jerky shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: Recalibrating the transmission control module (TCM). Replacing the valve body may be necessary in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 (recalibration), $500-$1,500+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking, popping, or creaking noises coming from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn ball joints, tie rod ends, or sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per side, depending on the parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Touchscreen freezing, Bluetooth connectivity problems, system reboots, and distorted sound.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the radio head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery dies overnight or after short periods of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Identify the parasitic draw by testing the circuits individually and replacing the faulty component causing the draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Running Board Malfunction (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Running boards fail to extend or retract properly, get stuck, or make excessive noise.
    *   Solution: Clean and lubricate the running board hinges and motors. Replacement of the running board motor or the entire assembly may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$100 (cleaning and lubrication), $300-$1,000+ (motor or assembly replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement.

**Summary**

The 2016 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a capable truck, but it has several common issues owners should be aware of. The most serious and costly issues relate to the Duramax diesel engine, particularly the CP4 fuel pump. The AFM lifter failure on the 6.0L Vortec engine is another significant concern. Electrical and infotainment glitches are also relatively common. While some issues are minor, others can lead to expensive repairs, making a thorough inspection and service history review essential before purchasing.
