The 2012 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a popular heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. It offers a comfortable ride for a truck in its class. However, some common complaints include issues with the diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) system on diesel models and some electrical glitches. The 2012 Sierra 2500 HD offered two engine options: a 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine (360 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8 engine (397 hp and 765 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the valve seals or piston rings can address the issue. A compression test can help diagnose the source of the oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbodiesel V8 Engine (LML)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, white smoke from the exhaust, and a decrease in fuel economy. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to specific cylinders might be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s). It's often recommended to replace all injectors at once to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Service DEF System" message on the dashboard, reduced engine power, and DTCs related to the DEF system. Problems can include a faulty DEF level sensor, DEF pump failure, or a clogged DEF injector.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific DEF system component that is failing. Replacement of the DEF level sensor, pump, injector, or the entire DEF tank assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.6L Duramax Diesel)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, and slipping between gears. Can be accompanied by transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary if damage has occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or abrupt shifts between gears, particularly between 1st and 2nd, or 2nd and 3rd.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body issues might be present, requiring valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6L90 6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.0L Vortec Gasoline)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, and slipping between gears. Can be accompanied by transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary if damage has occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the truck sags, especially when loaded. Cracked or broken leaf springs may be visible. This is more common on trucks that are frequently used for heavy towing or hauling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf spring(s). Upgrading to heavier-duty leaf springs may be recommended if the truck is regularly used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per spring
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front End Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive wear of ball joints, tie rod ends, and pitman arm. This leads to loose steering and difficulty maintaining alignment.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn components and front end alignment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on the number of parts replaced
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as malfunctioning power windows, door locks, or lights. The BCM may need to be reprogrammed or replaced.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine if the BCM can be reprogrammed or needs replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 GMC Sierra 2500 HD can be a reliable truck, but it's important to be aware of the potential issues. Diesel models are prone to DEF system and fuel injector issues, which can be costly to repair. Gasoline models can experience oil consumption problems. Both engine configurations can suffer from torque converter failure. Suspension components are also prone to wear, especially with heavy use. Electrical problems related to the BCM and grounding issues are also common. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor electrical fixes to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls. Inspecting a prospective purchase thoroughly, especially the DEF system (if applicable), suspension, and electrical components, is recommended.
