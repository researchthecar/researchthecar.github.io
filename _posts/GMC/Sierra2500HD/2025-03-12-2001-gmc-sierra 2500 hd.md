The 2001 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a heavy-duty truck known for its durability and towing capabilities. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque), the 8.1L Vortec V8 (340 hp, 455 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (300 hp, 520 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included the 4L80E four-speed automatic and the Allison 1000 five-speed automatic (diesel only). Owners often appreciate the truck's robust build and towing capacity, but common complaints include issues related to rust, fuel system components, and some electrical gremlins.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks externally, often noticed as a sweet smell or low coolant level. Can lead to overheating if left unaddressed.
