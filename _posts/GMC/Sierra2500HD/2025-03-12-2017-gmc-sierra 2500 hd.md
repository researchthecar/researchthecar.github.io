The 2017 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing capability and workhorse nature. Engine options include a 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (445 hp and 910 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with a 6-speed Allison automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the truck's strong engine performance and robust build, while some common complaints revolve around ride quality and some reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (L5P)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and potential check engine light. Can lead to severe engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This fuel pump is known to fail on certain diesel engines because the lubrication of the pump is provided by diesel fuel. The failure causes metal shavings to flow through the fuel system causing damage to all the fuel injectors, fuel rails, and the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Solution: The only solution is to replace the entire fuel system, including fuel injectors, fuel rails, fuel pump, and any other components that may have been contaminated with metal shavings. In addition, there are aftermarket kits available to replace the CP4 with a CP3 fuel pump that is more reliable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+

**6.0L Vortec V8 (L96)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not monitored.
