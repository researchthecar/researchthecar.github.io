**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, and a check engine light. Often caused by failure of the AFM lifters which deactivate cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, often including replacement of all lifters, camshaft, and related components. AFM Delete is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
