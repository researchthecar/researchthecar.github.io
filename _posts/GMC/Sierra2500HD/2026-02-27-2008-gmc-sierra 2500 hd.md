### Summary Verdict

The Duramax diesel engine, while powerful, has a few documented issues, primarily concerning fuel injectors and glow plugs, which can be costly to repair. The Allison 1000 transmission is robust but can experience torque converter shudder or overheating under heavy use, requiring attention. Electrical components like the alternator and trailer brake controller are the most common non-powertrain issues. Overall, for a heavy-duty truck of this era, the Sierra 2500 HD is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific concerns related to the diesel engine and transmission.
