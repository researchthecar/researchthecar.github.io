### Summary Verdict
The 2007 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a capable and generally reliable heavy-duty truck. The Duramax diesel engine, while powerful, can be prone to issues with glow plugs, injectors, and the EGR system, which are common for diesel powertrains of this era. The gasoline V8 has potential for intake manifold leaks and AFM-related problems. Transmission issues, particularly with the Allison 1000, often involve the torque converter. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear over time, especially under heavy use. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM issues and alternator failures, can occur. Interior and exterior components are less prone to major failures, with common issues being HVAC blower motors and tailgate latches. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing known issues, the 2007 Sierra 2500 HD can remain a dependable workhorse.
