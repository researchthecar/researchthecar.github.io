The 2010 GMC Sierra 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. It offers a range of engine and transmission options to suit different needs. The available engine options include a 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine producing 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 engine producing 397 horsepower and 765 lb-ft of torque. The gasoline engine is typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel engine is paired with a heavy-duty Allison 1000 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sierra 2500 HD for its ruggedness, towing capacity, and comfortable interior for a work truck. However, some common complaints include fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine), occasional electrical issues, and the overall cost of maintenance and repairs associated with a heavy-duty vehicle.
