The 2001 GMC B7 is a cutaway van chassis commonly used for shuttle buses, RVs, and other specialized vehicles. It's built for heavy-duty applications and durability. It was offered with different engine options, including the Vortec 5.7L V8 (rated around 255 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque) and the Vortec 7.4L V8 (rated around 290 horsepower and 410 lb-ft of torque). Transmissions were typically either a 4L60E or a 4L80E automatic, depending on the engine and GVWR. Owners often appreciate the B7's robust chassis and potential for customization, while common complaints revolve around fuel economy, ride quality (especially when empty), and the age-related mechanical issues that can plague older commercial vehicles.

**Engine**

**Vortec 5.7L V8**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks externally at the front or rear of the engine where the intake manifold meets the cylinder heads, or internally leading to coolant in the oil. Can cause engine overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and low coolant levels.
    * Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket, often with an updated design using improved materials. Inspect the intake manifold for warping and replace if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure (Spider Injector)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, poor fuel economy, and check engine light activation. Often caused by the original "spider" fuel injection system used in some early Vortec engines.
    * Solution: Replace the "spider" injector with an updated multiport fuel injection (MFI) system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Vortec 7.4L V8**

* **Distributor Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, stalling, and difficulty starting. Often related to wear in the distributor gear or failure of the distributor module.
    * Solution: Replace the distributor assembly, including the distributor gear and module. Ensure proper timing adjustment after replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks (Rear Main Seal)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the rear of the engine, often dripping onto the transmission bellhousing. Can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    * Solution: Replace the rear main seal. This often requires removing the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E**

* **Slipping/Erratic Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, or failure to shift into certain gears. Often caused by worn clutches or valve body issues.
    * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. A valve body replacement might resolve minor issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (valve body) - $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially when accelerating from a stop. Can also cause overheating and transmission damage.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter. Inspect the transmission for damage from debris and flush the transmission cooler lines.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**4L80E**

* **Hard Shifts/Delayed Engagement**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifts between gears, especially 1-2 and 2-3. Can also experience delayed engagement into drive or reverse. Often caused by valve body wear or internal component failure.
    * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. A valve body replacement might resolve minor issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (valve body) - $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Overheating**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission overheats, leading to poor performance and potential damage. Often caused by low fluid levels, a clogged transmission cooler, or internal component failure.
    * Solution: Check and correct fluid level. Flush or replace the transmission cooler. Rebuild or replace the transmission if internal damage is present.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (flush) - $300 (cooler) - $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Ball Joints/Control Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace worn ball joints and control arm bushings. Inspect other suspension components for wear and replace as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear end sag, poor ride quality, and potential for spring breakage. Especially common on vehicles that have been heavily loaded for extended periods.
    * Solution: Replace leaf springs, possibly with heavy-duty options.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine fails to start or stalls intermittently. Can also experience a loss of power during acceleration.
    * Solution: Replace the fuel pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery light illuminates, battery fails to charge, and electrical systems malfunction.
    * Solution: Replace the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust (Frame/Body)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the frame, body panels, and undercarriage. Particularly prevalent in areas with road salt use.
    * Solution: Rust repair, replacement of rusted components, and rust prevention treatments. Severity varies widely based on the extent of the rust.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $10000+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Headlight/Taillight Lens Clouding/Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Headlight and taillight lenses become cloudy, yellowed, or cracked, reducing visibility.
    * Solution: Replace headlight and taillight assemblies. Lens restoration kits may offer temporary improvement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per light
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**

**Summary:**

The 2001 GMC B7, while a robust platform, can suffer from age-related issues common to older commercial vehicles. Engine problems such as intake manifold leaks and fuel injector issues (for the 5.7L) and distributor/oil leaks for the 7.4L are common. Transmission problems (slipping/hard shifts) are prevalent with both the 4L60E and 4L80E. Suspension wear is also typical. The severity and cost of these issues vary significantly, with rust being potentially the most expensive to address if widespread. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
