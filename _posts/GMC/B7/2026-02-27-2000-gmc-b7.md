### Summary Verdict
The 2000 GMC B7 is a workhorse vehicle that, like many of its vintage, requires diligent maintenance. The Vortec gasoline engines are generally reliable but can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and distributor wear. The Duramax diesel, while powerful, is susceptible to injector line leaks and glow plug issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4L80-E, may require attention to the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can experience wear and breakage under heavy use. Electrical systems are prone to corrosion and connection issues, and the exterior can be affected by rust. Interior components like the HVAC system and dashboard plastics are also common areas for age-related failures. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing issues promptly are crucial for ensuring the continued reliability of a 2000 GMC B7.
