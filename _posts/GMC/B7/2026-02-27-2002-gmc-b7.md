### Summary Verdict
The 2002 GMC B7 is a generally reliable platform, especially when equipped with the Duramax diesel and Allison transmission, which are known for their durability. The gasoline Vortec V8 engines are also robust but can be prone to common issues like intake manifold leaks. Transmission issues are not widespread but can occur, particularly with the 4L80-E. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, may require attention due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical gremlins and interior component failures, such as HVAC blower motors and dashboard gauges, are also potential areas of concern, as is rust on exterior panels. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to reported symptoms are crucial for maintaining the longevity and reliability of these vehicles.
