### Summary Verdict
The 2001 GMC B7, in its various configurations, generally presents as a durable vehicle, especially concerning its core powertrain and chassis components. While the Vortec gasoline engines and Duramax diesel engines have specific known issues like intake manifold leaks or injector problems, these are often manageable with timely repairs. The Allison transmissions are typically robust, with torque converter issues being the most notable. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, can experience wear and breakage under heavy use. Electrical systems, while generally reliable, can be susceptible to alternator failure and wiring corrosion over time. Exterior rust is a common concern for vehicles of this age and type, requiring vigilance. Overall, the B7 is a workhorse that, with proper maintenance and attention to its specific potential failure points, can offer continued reliable service.
