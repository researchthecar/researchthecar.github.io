The 2022 GMC Acadia is a mid-size SUV that aims to balance comfort, space, and features. It's available with a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 engine producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, or a 3.6L V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. The Acadia is generally appreciated for its comfortable ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and available features like Super Cruise (on higher trims). Common complaints often include its smaller third-row seating compared to some competitors and the sometimes sluggish performance of the base engine.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating and the need to add oil more frequently than expected.
    *   Solution: The first step is usually an oil consumption test performed by a dealership to determine the rate of oil consumption. If excessive, potential solutions include replacing the PCV valve, or in more severe cases, replacing piston rings or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV valve) - $3000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature timing chain wear or failure. Symptoms can include a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold, a check engine light, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: The recommended solution is to replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.

**Summary:**

The 2022 GMC Acadia has a mix of potential issues, ranging from minor infotainment glitches to more serious engine and transmission problems. The most concerning issues relate to the 2.0L Turbo's oil consumption and the 3.6L V6 timing chain wear. Transmission issues are also fairly common across both engines. While some issues may be resolved with software updates or minor repairs, others could lead to significant repair bills. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and ensure the vehicle has been properly maintained before purchasing.
