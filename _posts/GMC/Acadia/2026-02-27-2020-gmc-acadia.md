### Summary Verdict
The 2020 GMC Acadia demonstrates a generally average reliability rating. The powertrain options (2.5L and 3.6L engines) are largely free of significant widespread issues. However, the 9-speed automatic transmission has been noted for potential shifting anomalies and hesitation, which may require software updates or more involved repairs. Electrical systems, particularly the infotainment screen and potential battery drain issues, are areas to monitor. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor and power seat actuators have also seen some reports of failure. While not plagued by critical flaws, owners should be aware of these potential points of concern and budget accordingly for possible repairs, especially concerning the transmission and electrical systems.
