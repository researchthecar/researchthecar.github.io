The 2010 GMC Acadia is a full-size crossover SUV that was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and relatively good fuel economy for its class. It was a popular choice for families needing three rows of seating and decent cargo capacity. However, it also had its share of problems, leading to owner complaints. The Acadia in 2010 came equipped with a 3.6L V6 engine, producing 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. All models are equipped with the 6T75 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners liked the Acadia's smooth ride, passenger space, and overall versatility. Common dislikes included transmission issues, excessive oil consumption, and some electrical problems.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is one of the most common and well-documented issues for the 2010 Acadia. Symptoms include a check engine light, trouble codes (P0008, P0016, P0017, P0018), rough idling, decreased engine performance, and a rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup. Premature wear of the timing chain guides and tensioners are the usual culprit.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially the camshaft sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent oil additions between changes. This can be caused by worn piston rings, valve seals, or PCV valve issues. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, the fix can range from replacing the PCV valve to performing an engine overhaul to replace piston rings and valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve) - $3,000+ (Engine Overhaul)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6T75 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **"Hard" or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners frequently reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can sometimes be accompanied by a "clunking" noise during shifts.
    *   Solution: Sometimes a transmission fluid flush and software update can resolve the issue. If not, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Fluid Flush) - $3,000+ (Transmission Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In some cases, the 6T75 transmission can fail completely, resulting in the inability to shift or move the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Transmission replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn struts and shocks can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances. Leaking fluid from the struts/shocks is a visual indication of failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A humming, grinding, or roaring noise that changes with vehicle speed. The noise may worsen when turning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (per wheel)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing individual circuits and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (Depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks that fail to function properly, either not locking/unlocking or making a grinding noise.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (per door)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: HVAC blower motor only works on certain speeds or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear liftgate will not stay open on its own and falls shut.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Airbag light on the dashboard illuminated. Can be caused by faulty sensors or wiring.
    * Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to pinpoint the fault, followed by repair or replacement of the affected component (sensor, wiring, etc.).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 GMC Acadia can be a good family vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The timing chain and transmission problems are the most serious and potentially expensive to repair. The excessive oil consumption can also lead to long-term engine damage if not addressed. Electrical issues can be annoying and require troubleshooting. Overall, a thorough inspection and service history review are essential before purchasing a 2010 Acadia.
