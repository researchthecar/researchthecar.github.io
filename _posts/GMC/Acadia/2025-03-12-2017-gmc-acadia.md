The 2017 GMC Acadia represents the first year of the second generation of this mid-size SUV. It offers a more manageable size compared to the previous generation, making it easier to maneuver. Engine options include a 2.5L Inline-4 producing 193 hp and 188 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 producing 310 hp and 271 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Acadia's comfortable ride, spacious interior (especially in models with the 3rd row), and updated technology features. However, some common complaints include the sometimes sluggish performance of the 2.5L engine, and some reliability issues with certain components.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported high oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms can include the low oil pressure light illuminating or engine knocking noises due to low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Check oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, a dealer may recommend an oil consumption test to determine the source of the leak or burn. In some cases, piston ring replacement might be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.6L V6 engine is known for potential timing chain issues. Symptoms include a rattling noise upon starting the engine, a check engine light with codes related to timing, and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners. It is essential to perform this repair promptly to prevent further engine damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported high pressure fuel pump failures. The symptoms include long cranks when starting the vehicle, the check engine light illuminating, and engine stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or "jerk" during acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation can also occur when trying to accelerate from a stop or low speed.
    *   Solution: Software update for the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes resolve this issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (software update), $800 - $1,500+ (valve body), $3,000 - $6,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing premature battery drain, particularly if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can result in the vehicle not starting. This may be due to parasitic draw.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component. This could involve testing various electrical components and circuits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Glitches with the infotainment system, including freezing, unresponsive touch screen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and problems with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates for the infotainment system can often resolve these issues. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update, may be covered under warranty), $500 - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may intermittently fail to display an image, or the image may be distorted or blurry.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. If the connections are good, the camera itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: #N232426660 (Applies to certain VIN ranges)

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, may make unusual noises, or may stop working altogether.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts, sensors, and motor. Replacement of faulty components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may blow warm air, or may not cool effectively. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a problem with the blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Leak test the system and recharge the refrigerant. Replace any faulty components, such as the compressor, condenser, or blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (recharge), $400 - $1200+ (compressor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
