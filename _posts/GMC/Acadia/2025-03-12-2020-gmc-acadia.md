The 2020 GMC Acadia is a mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior, making it a popular choice for families. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of reported issues. The 2020 Acadia offers three engine options: a 2.5L 4-cylinder (193 hp and 188 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L V6 (310 hp and 271 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L Turbocharged 4-cylinder (230 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Acadia for its user-friendly technology and quiet cabin but sometimes complain about its perceived lack of power with the base engine and occasional transmission issues.
