### Summary Verdict
The 2022 GMC Acadia presents a mixed reliability profile. While its chassis and exterior components generally hold up well, potential owners should be aware of reported issues with the powertrain, particularly concerning the 9-speed automatic transmission's shifting behavior and potential turbocharger problems with the 2.0L engine. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted concerns. The 3.6L V6 engine, while more robust, can experience oil leaks. Addressing these potential issues proactively through regular maintenance and prompt repairs can help mitigate long-term costs and ensure a more reliable ownership experience.
