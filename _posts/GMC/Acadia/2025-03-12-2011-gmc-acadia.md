The 2011 GMC Acadia is a full-size crossover SUV known for its spaciousness and comfortable ride. It was offered with a single engine option, a 3.6L V6 engine producing approximately 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Acadia's generous cargo space and third-row seating. However, some common complaints include issues with the timing chain, transmission, and electrical system.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6 (LLT)**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive wear of the timing chain due to oil degradation or lack of maintenance. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough idling, engine misfires, and a rattling noise coming from the engine. This can lead to reduced engine performance and eventually complete engine failure if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioners. It is recommended to also inspect and clean the oil passages to ensure proper lubrication.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) can start leaking over time. This leak causes a loss of fuel pressure. It also causes the fuel to enter the engine oil, causing it to become diluted, ultimately causing engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the High Pressure Fuel Pump
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70/6T75)**

*   **Wave Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or complete failure of the 3-5-R wave plate inside the transmission. This results in delayed or harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or complete loss of certain gears.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement with an updated wave plate design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter fails, causing shuddering during acceleration, poor fuel economy, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the struts and shocks, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn rear sway bar links leading to clunking noises and reduced stability during turns.
    *   Solution: Replace rear sway bar links
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate correctly, often getting stuck or moving slowly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Stabilitrak/Traction Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "Service Stabilitrak" or "Service Traction Control" message appears, often accompanied by a loss of power or erratic braking. This can be caused by a faulty wheel speed sensor, steering angle sensor, or issues with the electronic brake control module (EBCM).
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause with a scan tool and replacing the faulty sensor or module. Sometimes, a software update can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate failing to open or close properly, or making unusual noises. This is often due to a faulty liftgate motor, struts, or sensors.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty liftgate motor, struts, or sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air from the air conditioning system. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Repairing the refrigerant leak, replacing the compressor, or replacing the blend door actuator.
