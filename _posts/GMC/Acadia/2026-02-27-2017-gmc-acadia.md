### Summary Verdict
The 2017 GMC Acadia presents a generally reliable profile, particularly with its standard 2.5L engine. The optional 3.6L V6 has seen some reports of oil leaks, which are typically manageable with seal or gasket replacements. The transmission, while functional, can occasionally exhibit hesitation or shuddering, often addressable through fluid services or software updates. Electrical gremlins, primarily concerning the infotainment system's responsiveness and occasional battery drain issues, are the most frequently cited problems. Exterior and interior components are largely free from widespread defects. Overall, the Acadia is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the minor engine oil leak and electrical system concerns.
