The 2019 GMC Acadia is a mid-size SUV offering a blend of comfort, style, and practicality. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 193 hp and 188 lb-ft of torque and a 3.6L V6 delivering 310 hp and 271 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Acadia's spacious interior and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include transmission issues, electrical problems, and concerns about the reliability of certain components.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the 2.5L engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be indicated by the low oil pressure light illuminating or a noticeable decrease in engine performance.
    *   Solution: The first step is often to monitor oil consumption closely and document it. If consumption is deemed excessive by GMC standards, the dealer may perform an oil consumption test. Depending on the results, possible solutions range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive engine repairs, such as piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve) - $3,000+ (Piston Ring Replacement or Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature timing chain wear or stretching, leading to rough idling, decreased performance, and potential engine damage. A check engine light with codes related to timing chain issues (e.g., P0008, P0017) may illuminate.
    * Solution: Diagnosis typically involves inspecting the timing chain for wear or stretching. The solution is usually to replace the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and possibly associated components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. Others experience hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating from a stop or during passing maneuvers.
    *   Solution: The first step is often a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the dealer may reprogram the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Fluid Flush) - $3,500+ (Transmission Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, especially at lower speeds or during light acceleration, can indicate a torque converter issue.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and filter change with updated fluid can sometimes alleviate the shudder. In more severe cases, torque converter replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Fluid Flush) - $1,500+ (Torque Converter Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the struts and/or shocks wear out prematurely, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll in corners, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ (depending on location and parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, resulting in a dead battery, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking for parasitic drains using a multimeter. The source of the drain could be a faulty module, a malfunctioning accessory, or a wiring issue. Repair involves fixing or replacing the faulty component causing the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent issues with the infotainment system, such as freezing, crashing, unresponsive touchscreen, or Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: The first step is often a system reset or software update. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,000+ (Infotainment Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, get stuck in either position, or make unusual noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts and the liftgate motor. Replacement of the struts or the motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on parts needing to be replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may blow warm air, have inconsistent cooling, or make unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Check the AC compressor and related components. Recharge or repair the compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,200+ (depending on parts needing to be replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 GMC Acadia, while generally well-received for its comfort and space, can experience some notable issues. The most concerning relate to the engine (timing chain wear, oil consumption) and transmission (harsh shifting, torque converter issues). Electrical problems, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, are also relatively common. While some issues may be minor and inexpensive to fix (like a software update), others can be more severe and costly (such as timing chain replacement or transmission rebuilds). Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect any used Acadia before purchase, paying particular attention to engine noise, transmission performance, and the operation of electrical systems.
