The 2016 GMC Acadia marked a pivotal year as the last of its first generation, offering a blend of SUV versatility and car-like handling. Engine options included a 2.5L Inline-4 engine and the more popular 3.6L V6, both paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 3.6L V6 produced 281 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praised the Acadia for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and ample cargo capacity, making it a good choice for families. However, common complaints centered around reliability issues, particularly with the transmission, electrical components, and some engine-related problems.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles, blue exhaust smoke, and possible engine knocking if oil levels get too low.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the valve cover gasket or PCV valve might help. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 (valve cover gasket/PCV valve); $2,000 - $5,000+ (piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to rough running, misfires, and a check engine light. This can be caused by oil quality or infrequent oil changes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70/6T75)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or delayed shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear or when downshifting. This can also manifest as a clunking noise during gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update might improve the issue. However, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary in other cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (fluid flush and software update); $800 - $1,500 (valve body replacement); $3,000 - $5,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at certain speeds, especially during light acceleration. Can also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and fluid leaks from the shocks or struts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn shocks and/or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle (depending on the shop and brand of parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, even when the vehicle is not in use. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to find the parasitic draw. Possible causes include a faulty alternator, a malfunctioning module (e.g., the infotainment system), or a short circuit in the wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, reboots randomly, or loses functionality. Bluetooth connectivity issues are also common.
    *   Solution: Software updates may fix minor glitches. More severe issues may require replacement of the infotainment system module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power or manual liftgate won't stay open, sags, or slams shut.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning blows warm air, or the airflow is weak. Can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the A/C system. Possible repairs include leak repair, compressor replacement, or blend door actuator replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,200+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window won't go up or down, or moves very slowly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 GMC Acadia presents a mix of desirable features and potential reliability concerns. The most common issues involve the transmission (harsh shifting, torque converter problems), engine (excessive oil consumption, timing chain issues), and electrical systems (battery drain, infotainment glitches). The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs. The estimated costs to fix range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and thoroughly inspect any used 2016 Acadia before purchasing, paying close attention to the transmission's performance and the overall maintenance history.
