**Summary**

The 2009 GMC Acadia is prone to several issues, with the most concerning being timing chain problems and transmission failures. Timing chain issues can lead to significant engine damage if left unaddressed, and transmission problems can result in costly repairs or replacements. Electrical and suspension issues, while less severe, can contribute to overall ownership costs. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to identify and address any potential problems. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major engine or transmission work.
