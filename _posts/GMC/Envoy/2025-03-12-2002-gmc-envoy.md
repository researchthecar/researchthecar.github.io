The 2002 GMC Envoy was a popular mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and truck-like capabilities. The standard engine was a 4.2L Inline 6-cylinder engine, producing 270 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciated its towing capacity and relatively smooth ride for a body-on-frame SUV. Common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with electrical components and the suspension. While some found it a capable and comfortable vehicle, others experienced frustrating and costly repairs.

**Engine**

**4.2L Inline 6 (LL8)**

*   **Rough Idle/Misfire**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, hesitation upon acceleration, and potential misfire codes (P0300, P0301, P0302, etc.). Often caused by worn or fouled spark plugs, faulty ignition coils, or vacuum leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace spark plugs and/or ignition coils. Inspect vacuum lines for leaks and repair as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the extent of the problem.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Loss/Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant levels, overheating engine, white smoke from exhaust (potential head gasket issue). Can be caused by a cracked cylinder head (common issue on this engine), leaking water pump, or faulty thermostat.
    *   Solution: Pressure test cooling system to identify leaks. Replace water pump, thermostat, or cylinder head as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2000+ depending on the component that needs replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots on the driveway or garage floor, burning oil smell. Often caused by leaking valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location of the leak.

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or complete loss of drive. Can be caused by worn clutch packs, solenoid failure, or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the transmission may require rebuilding or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement).
