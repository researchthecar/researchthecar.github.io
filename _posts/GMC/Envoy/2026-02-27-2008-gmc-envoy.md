### Summary Verdict
The 2008 GMC Envoy, particularly with the 4.2L inline-6 engine, generally presents a reasonable reliability record. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the intake manifold gaskets and oil pressure sensors. The 5.3L V8, while powerful, is more susceptible to problems related to its Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, which can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, can arise, often involving the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components like wheel bearings and, if equipped, the rear air suspension compressor are also points to monitor. Electrical gremlins stemming from the BCM and common alternator failures are also documented. Interior climate control issues, specifically blend door actuators, are not uncommon. Overall, while not plagued by widespread critical failures, the Envoy requires diligent maintenance and awareness of these specific potential problem areas to ensure continued serviceability.
