### Summary Verdict
The 2009 GMC Envoy, while offering robust engine options and a comfortable ride, exhibits some common issues that owners should be aware of. The Vortec engines, particularly the V8 with AFM, can be prone to internal component wear. Transmission issues, especially with the torque converter, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are typical wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can surface. Exterior rust and interior comfort system failures, such as HVAC blend doors, are also reported. Despite these potential drawbacks, many of these issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, allowing the Envoy to remain a capable vehicle.
