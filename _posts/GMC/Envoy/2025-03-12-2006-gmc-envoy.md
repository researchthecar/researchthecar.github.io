The 2006 GMC Envoy is a mid-size SUV that offers a blend of comfort and utility. The most common engine option is the 4.2L Inline-6, producing approximately 291 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. A 5.3L V8 engine, which produces approximately 302 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, was also available as an upgrade. Both engines were paired with the 4L60-E 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Envoy's spacious interior and smooth ride, but common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy, some reliability issues, and an outdated interior design for its time.

**Summary**

The 2006 GMC Envoy can be a decent vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of its common issues. Engine problems like camshaft actuator failure in the I6 and oil consumption/lifter failure in the V8 can be costly, as can transmission issues with the 4L60-E. Electrical issues are also fairly common. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission rebuilds, can be very expensive. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
