### Summary Verdict
The 2007 GMC Envoy, particularly with its popular 4.2L and 5.3L engines, presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the intake manifold gaskets and, for the V8, the Active Fuel Management system. Transmission concerns, especially with the 4L60-E, often involve the torque converter clutch. Suspension components like wheel bearings and ball joints are also noted areas for potential repair. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, can be frustrating. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential repair points and budget accordingly for maintenance beyond routine service.
