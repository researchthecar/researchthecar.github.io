### Summary Verdict
The 2002 GMC Envoy, particularly with the 4.2L Atlas I6 engine, is generally considered to have a more robust powertrain than the V8 option, which can be prone to AFM-related issues. Transmission reliability is decent, but torque converter and solenoid issues are not uncommon as the vehicle ages. Suspension components like wheel bearings and ball joints are typical wear items that require attention. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM, and alternator failures are also reported. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on climate. Interior issues like blend door actuators and dashboard cracking are also noted. Overall, while capable, expect to address age-related issues, especially in the powertrain and electrical systems.
