The 2009 GMC Envoy is a mid-size SUV that offered a blend of utility and comfort. Engine options included a 4.2L Inline-6 engine producing 285 horsepower and 276 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 engine producing 302 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. The inline-6 was paired with a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 was offered with the same 4L60E transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Envoy's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capability. Common complaints revolved around fuel economy, some reliability issues, and the dated interior design compared to newer competitors.

**Summary**

The 2009 GMC Envoy can experience a variety of issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical faults to more serious engine and transmission problems. The severity and cost of repairs vary depending on the specific issue and the engine/transmission configuration. The AFM lifter failure in the 5.3L V8 engines can be a particularly costly repair, while electrical and suspension issues, such as door lock actuator failures or air suspension problems, can also add up. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are recommended when considering purchasing a used 2009 GMC Envoy.
