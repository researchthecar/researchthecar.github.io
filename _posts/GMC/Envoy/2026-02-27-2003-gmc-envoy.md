### Summary Verdict
The 2003 GMC Envoy, particularly with the 5.3L V8 engine, can be a reliable vehicle if well-maintained, but it is not without its common issues. Owners should be aware of potential problems with the intake manifold gaskets on both engines, and specific concerns like AFM lifter issues on the V8. Transmission reliability is generally decent, but torque converter issues can arise. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and ignition switch, are not uncommon. Rust can be a significant factor depending on climate. Addressing these known issues proactively can help maintain the Envoy's functionality and value.
