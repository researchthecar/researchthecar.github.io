### Summary Verdict
The 2006 GMC Envoy, particularly with the popular 4.2L inline-six engine, is a reasonably reliable SUV, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Common concerns include intake manifold gasket leaks and ignition coil failures for both engine options. The 5.3L V8 can experience Active Fuel Management (AFM) related problems. Transmission issues, such as torque converter clutch solenoid failure, are also noted. Suspension components like wheel bearings and ball joints may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM, and exterior rust are other areas to monitor. While not overwhelmingly problematic, addressing these potential issues proactively can help maintain the Envoy's functionality and value.
