The 2008 GMC Envoy is a mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior, but it has been known to have several issues. Available engines include a 4.2L inline-6 engine producing 285 horsepower and 276 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 engine producing 302 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. The 4.2L engine was mated to a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. The 5.3L V8 was also mated to a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Envoy's towing capability and comfortable seating, but frequently complain about fuel economy and some reliability issues.

**Engine**

**4.2L Inline-6**

*   **Camshaft Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may experience rough idling, loss of power, and the check engine light will illuminate. Diagnostic codes will typically point to issues with the camshaft actuator or solenoid.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft actuator solenoid or the entire actuator assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks (Timing Cover)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant may leak from the timing cover gasket, leading to low coolant levels and potential overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing cover gasket and resealing the timing cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can cause lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking noise, rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light. Diagnostic codes will indicate cylinder misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system altogether.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can occur, requiring frequent oil top-offs between changes. This is often related to the AFM system.
    *   Solution: Addressing the AFM system issues, such as lifter replacement or AFM delete. In some cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and chosen repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4L60E transmission is known to experience slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, and complete failure, especially at higher mileages.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially when accelerating. Can lead to complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the Envoy has air suspension, the compressor can fail, leading to a sagging rear end and a rough ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Suspension Air Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the Envoy has air suspension, air bags can leak causing the compressor to overwork, or the vehicle to sag.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air bags.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noisy wheel bearings are a common issue. Symptoms include a humming or grinding noise that increases with speed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected wheel bearing(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per wheel bearing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Panel Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument panel can experience issues, such as gauges malfunctioning or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument panel.

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks may fail to lock or unlock.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor may only work on certain settings, or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Rocker Panels/Wheel Wells)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is a common problem, especially in areas with road salt. It is most prevalent in the rocker panels and around the wheel wells.

**Summary**

The 2008 GMC Envoy is a decent SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine issues, particularly with the AFM system in the 5.3L V8, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems are also a concern. Suspension issues, electrical gremlins, and rust are also issues owners commonly encounter. Overall, expect medium to high repair costs. A thorough inspection before purchase is recommended.
