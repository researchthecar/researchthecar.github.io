The 2007 GMC Sierra 1500 Classic is a full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and capability. It was offered with a variety of engines including a 4.3L V6 (200 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 4.8L V8 (295 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.3L V8 (315 hp, 338 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the truck for its comfortable ride, strong towing capacity, and straightforward design. Common dislikes include fuel economy and some reported issues with reliability as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust and low oil levels.
    * Solution: There is no reliable fix besides monitoring oil levels and adding oil as needed. Some owners have had success with switching to a higher viscosity oil.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause. If due to worn valve seals, the cost could range from $500 - $1500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, is prone to lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking noise from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light. Often the issue can start on cylinder #1 or #7, and can lead to camshaft damage if not addressed quickly.
    * Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft is the common repair. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system or replace the AFM lifters with standard lifters to prevent future issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L V8, the 5.3L V8 can also suffer from excessive oil consumption.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels and adding oil as needed. Potential repairs include replacing valve seals or piston rings, but these are costly and may not completely resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+, depending on severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4L60E)**

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report issues such as delayed engagement into drive or reverse, harsh shifts between gears, and slipping.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush *might* resolve minor issues. More often, the solution involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Common culprits include worn valve body components or a failing torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $100 - $200, Rebuild $1500 - $3000, Replacement $2500 - $4500.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Ball Joints and Control Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacing worn ball joints and control arm bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Broken Leaf Springs**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension sagging, especially when loaded or towing. This can lead to poor handling and reduced load capacity.
    * Solution: Replacing the broken leaf spring(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per side.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning, flickering, or completely failing.
    * Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Lock Actuators Failing**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to lock or unlock, either manually or with the remote.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per door.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Arches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower body panels, especially around the wheel wells and rocker panels, particularly in areas with road salt exposure.
    * Solution: Repairing or replacing the rusted panels, which can involve welding and bodywork.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per panel, depending on severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks developing in the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacing the dashboard (expensive) or installing a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Dash cover $50 - $200, Dashboard replacement $800 - $2000.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor only working on certain speeds or not at all.
    * Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 GMC Sierra 1500 Classic, while generally reliable, does have its share of common issues as it ages. Engine problems, particularly related to AFM lifter failure and oil consumption in the 5.3L V8, can be expensive to address. Transmission issues with the 4L60E can also lead to significant repair costs. Suspension and electrical problems, while less severe, can still impact the driving experience and require attention. Rust on the rocker panels and wheel arches is a common concern, especially in colder climates. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering purchasing this vehicle.
