### Summary Verdict
The 2000 GMC Sierra 2500 is a capable truck, but its age means potential for issues. The diesel engine, while powerful, can be costly to repair if injectors or glow plugs fail. Gasoline V8s are generally robust but can suffer from intake manifold or head gasket leaks. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, and suspension wear are common for trucks of this vintage and mileage. Electrical gremlins and rust are also points to consider. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining reliability.
