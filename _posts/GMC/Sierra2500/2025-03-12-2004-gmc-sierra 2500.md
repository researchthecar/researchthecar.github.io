**Summary**

The 2004 GMC Sierra 2500, while a capable and popular truck, has its share of common issues. Engine problems like intake manifold leaks and fuel injector failures (Duramax) can be costly. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L80E and NV4500, are also potential concerns. Suspension components like ball joints and steering linkages are prone to wear. Rust is a significant issue, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Interior issues like dashboard cracking are also common. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely depending on the specific issue, but owners should be prepared for potential maintenance expenses. The Duramax diesel, while powerful, comes with the added expense of diesel-specific repairs.
