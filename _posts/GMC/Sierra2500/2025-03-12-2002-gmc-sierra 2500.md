The 2002 GMC Sierra 2500 is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and utilitarian design. It offered a variety of engine and transmission options to suit different needs. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (300 hp and 360 lb-ft of torque), the 8.1L Vortec V8, and the 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8. Transmission options consisted primarily of the 4L80E four-speed automatic and a manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the truck's towing capacity and durability, but common complaints revolve around age-related wear and tear, fuel economy, and certain mechanical issues. This information is based on the 6.0L Vortec V8 and 4L80E Four-Speed Automatic Transmission.
