### Summary Verdict
The 2004 GMC Sierra 2500 is a capable workhorse, with its gasoline V8 engines generally proving robust. The Duramax diesel, particularly the LLY variant, has known specific issues like overheating that require attention. Transmission reliability is generally good, though the 4L80-E and Allison 1000 can develop torque converter or solenoid issues over time. Manual transmissions are less prone to major electronic failures but can experience wear on synchronizers. Common issues across the board include suspension wear (ball joints, leaf springs), potential for rust on body panels, and some electrical gremlins often related to the BCM. HVAC blend door actuators are a frequent interior repair. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing known issues, the 2004 Sierra 2500 can remain a dependable truck.
