### Summary Verdict
The 2003 GMC Sierra 2500 is a capable truck, but its age means potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The gasoline engines, particularly the 6.0L, can experience intake manifold gasket and oil cooler line leaks. The larger 8.1L V8 is more prone to significant issues like head gasket failures. Diesel owners with the 6.6L Duramax (LB7) should watch for injector line problems. Transmission reliability is generally good, with the Allison 1000 being particularly robust. However, the 4L80-E automatic can have torque converter or solenoid issues, and the NV4500 manual may develop synchronizer wear. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are typical wear items for a truck of this vintage. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and occasional alternator failures are noted. Exterior rust is a common concern for vehicles of this era, especially in certain climates. Interior issues are mostly related to wear and tear, with blend door actuators being a specific point of failure. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these potential problems, the 2003 Sierra 2500 can remain a reliable workhorse.
