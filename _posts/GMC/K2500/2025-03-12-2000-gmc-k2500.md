**Summary**

The 2000 GMC K2500, while generally a dependable truck, does suffer from age-related issues. Engine problems can range from minor gasket leaks to more serious fuel injector failures, especially in the Duramax LB7 diesel models, which can be very expensive to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L80E, can also be costly. Rust is a significant concern for these trucks, especially in regions with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine or transmission rebuilds, can be substantial. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the truck for rust, check the maintenance history, and have a mechanic thoroughly evaluate the engine and transmission.
