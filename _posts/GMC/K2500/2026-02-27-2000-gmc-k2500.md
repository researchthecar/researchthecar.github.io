### Summary Verdict
The 2000 GMC K2500 is a capable truck with generally robust mechanicals, especially its V8 gasoline engines and the 4L80-E transmission. However, common issues for vehicles of this age include potential leaks from intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines on the Vortec V8s, and specific concerns like injector line failures on the Duramax diesel. Manual transmission models may encounter the 5th gear nut issue. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and BCM problems can arise. Rust is a significant concern for exterior longevity. Interior issues like HVAC blend door actuators and gauge cluster malfunctions are also reported. Regular maintenance and addressing these known issues proactively are key to maintaining the reliability of a 2000 K2500.
