The 2000 GMC C2500 is a Â¾-ton pickup truck known for its robust build and workhorse capabilities. Engine options included the 5.0L Vortec 5000 V8 (255 hp, 330 lb-ft torque), the 5.7L Vortec 5700 V8 (255 hp, 330 lb-ft torque), and the 7.4L Vortec 7400 V8 (290 hp, 410 lb-ft torque). A 6.5L Turbo Diesel V8 was also available (215 hp, 440 lb-ft torque). Transmission options were generally the 4L60E (with the 5.0L and some 5.7L engines), the 4L80E (with the 5.7L, 7.4L, and 6.5L Diesel), and a 5-speed manual transmission was also available with some engine configurations. Owners often appreciate the truck's durability and towing capacity, but common complaints revolve around fuel economy, age-related wear and tear, and specific issues detailed below.

**Engine**

**5.0L Vortec 5000 V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks externally around the intake manifold, leading to coolant loss and potential engine overheating. May also cause rough idle or misfires.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket with an updated design.

**Summary:**

The 2000 GMC C2500, while a reliable work truck, is prone to age-related issues. Engine problems like intake manifold leaks, fuel injector issues (especially in the 5.7L), and exhaust manifold leaks (7.4L) are common.
