### Summary Verdict
The 2022 GMC Sierra Nueva demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its larger V8 and diesel engine options. The 2.7L Turbo engine shows some potential for oil consumption and turbocharger issues, while the 5.3L V8 may encounter problems with its Active Fuel Management system. Transmission reliability is good overall, though some instances of harsh shifting have been noted. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are present but not pervasive. Exterior and interior components are mostly robust, with the Multi-Pro tailgate and power seat actuators being the most common areas for minor concerns. For buyers prioritizing long-term dependability, the 6.2L V8 and 3.0L Duramax Diesel engines appear to be the most reliable choices, provided the diesel's DPF system is maintained properly.
