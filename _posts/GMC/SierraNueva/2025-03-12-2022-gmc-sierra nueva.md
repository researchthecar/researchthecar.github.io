The 2022 GMC Sierra 1500 represents the fourth model year of the fourth generation of the popular pickup truck. Engine options include a 2.7L Turbo I4 (310 hp, 430 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I6 (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). The 2.7L is paired with an 8-speed automatic, while the other engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sierra for its updated interior design (especially on higher trims), comfortable ride, and strong towing capabilities. Common complaints include the relatively high price point, some lingering infotainment system glitches, and concerns about the long-term reliability of some of the newer technologies.

**Engine**
