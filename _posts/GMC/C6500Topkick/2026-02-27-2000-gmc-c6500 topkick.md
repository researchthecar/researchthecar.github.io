### Summary Verdict
The 2000 GMC C6500 Topkick is a capable heavy-duty truck, but its reliability is highly dependent on the chosen powertrain and maintenance history. Diesel engines, particularly the 6.6L Duramax and Caterpillar options, can be prone to costly injector and fuel system issues. Gasoline V8s are generally more straightforward but can suffer from intake manifold leaks. Automatic transmissions, especially the Allison units, are robust but can develop issues with torque converters or solenoids. Manual transmissions are simpler but subject to clutch and synchronizer wear. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, are subject to heavy use and potential breakage. Electrical issues like wiring harness corrosion are common in older vehicles. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly are key to ensuring the continued operational reliability of a 2000 C6500 Topkick.
