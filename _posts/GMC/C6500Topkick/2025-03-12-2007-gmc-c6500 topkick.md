    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential spark plug fouling.
    *   Solution: Difficult to definitively fix. Potential solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the chosen solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vacuum leaks, rough idle, poor fuel economy, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 5-Speed Automatic**
