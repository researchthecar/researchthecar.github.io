The 2002 GMC C6500 Topkick is a medium-duty truck known for its durability and hauling capabilities, commonly used in commercial applications such as construction, delivery, and towing. Available engine options for this model year include the 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8, 7.2L Caterpillar 3126 Diesel Inline 6, and the 8.1L Vortec Gas V8. The 6.6L Duramax, a popular choice, produced around 300 hp and 520 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included Allison automatic transmissions, primarily the 1000 and 2000 series. Owners often praised the truck's robust chassis and ability to handle heavy loads. Common complaints included relatively poor fuel economy (especially with the gas engine), a rough ride, and some issues related to the age of the vehicle as parts wear out.

**Summary**

The 2002 GMC C6500 Topkick, while a robust and capable truck, is prone to certain issues, particularly related to its age. Engine problems, especially with the 6.6L Duramax LB7 (injector failure) and 8.1L Vortec (oil consumption), and the 7.2L Caterpillar 3126 HEUI Injection issues can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the Allison 1000/2000 series, such as torque converter and shift solenoid failures, are also common. Suspension and electrical problems add to the potential maintenance burden. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and address any identified issues before purchasing.
