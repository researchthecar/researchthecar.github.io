**Summary**

The 2004 GMC C6500 Topkick, while a capable and durable medium-duty truck, exhibits several common issues. Engine problems range from relatively minor intake manifold leaks in the gasoline version to more significant fuel injector issues in the diesel variant. Transmission issues, particularly concerning the torque converter and shift solenoids, can be costly. Suspension problems, such as leaf spring issues, are also common due to the truck's heavy-duty nature. Electrical gremlins and rust are also significant concerns. The severity and cost of these issues vary greatly, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decisions.
