The 2012 GMC Savana 2500 is a full-size van known for its robust build and versatility. It's a popular choice for commercial use, cargo transport, and passenger transport. Engine options include a 4.8L V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp, 335 lb-ft torque), and a 6.0L V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft torque). Transmission options are generally a 4-speed automatic or a 6-speed automatic depending on the engine. Owners often praise the Savana for its dependability, payload capacity, and simple, easy-to-repair design. Common complaints include fuel economy, outdated interior, and somewhat rough ride quality.

**Summary**

The 2012 GMC Savana 2500 is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine-related problems, such as oil consumption and AFM lifter failure (particularly with the 5.3L engine), can be costly to repair. Transmission issues can range from minor fluid leaks to complete rebuilds. Suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior problems are also common, but tend to be less expensive to fix than major engine or transmission repairs. Overall, buyers should carefully inspect any potential Savana 2500 for these issues before purchasing.
