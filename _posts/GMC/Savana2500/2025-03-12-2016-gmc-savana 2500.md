The 2016 GMC Savana 2500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes or large families needing ample passenger or cargo space. Engine options for the 2016 Savana 2500 included a 4.8L V8 engine (280 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L V8 engine (342 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel engine (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). All engine options were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Savana's reliability, spaciousness, and workhorse capabilities.

**Summary**

The 2016 GMC Savana 2500, while a reliable workhorse, can experience a range of issues. Engine problems, particularly AFM lifter failure on the 6.0L V8, and DEF system issues on the 2.8L Duramax can be costly. Transmission issues, especially harsh shifting, are also a concern. Suspension wear and electrical gremlins stemming from the BCM can add to the ownership costs. The severity of these issues varies, but some can lead to significant repair bills. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, as well as thoroughly inspect the vehicle and review its maintenance history.
