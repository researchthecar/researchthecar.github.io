The 2002 GMC Savana 2500 is a full-size van known for its utility and reliability. Engine options included a 4.3L V6, a 5.0L V8, a 5.7L V8, and a 6.0L V8. The 5.7L V8 produced around 255 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the Savana's spaciousness, payload capacity, and relatively simple mechanics. Common complaints include the van's fuel economy, handling characteristics, and the age-related deterioration of components.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

**Summary**

The 2002 GMC Savana 2500, while generally a reliable workhorse, does suffer from age-related issues. The most concerning problems often involve the transmission (slipping/harsh shifting) and engine (oil leaks, sensor failures), which can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension wear (ball joints, leaf springs) is also common. Rust, especially in colder climates, is a significant concern. The cost of repairs can vary widely, from a few hundred dollars for minor electrical fixes to several thousand for transmission work.
