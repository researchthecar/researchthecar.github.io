The 2021 GMC Savana 2500 is a full-size cargo van known for its robust build and practicality. It offers three engine choices: a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque), a 6.6L V8 (401 hp, 464 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel Inline-4 (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). The 4.3L V6 and 2.8L Diesel are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.6L V8 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Savana's ample cargo space and towing capacity, but some dislike its dated interior and fuel economy. Common complaints revolve around certain mechanical issues and the van's overall lack of modern features compared to newer competitors.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common around the oil pan gasket and valve cover gaskets. Symptoms include oil spots on the ground, low oil levels, and the smell of burning oil.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L V8**
*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts, which lead to exhaust leaks. This results in a ticking sound, especially upon cold start, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken bolts and potentially the manifold if warped.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel Inline-4**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions in the DEF system, including sensor failures, pump issues, and clogged injectors. This can trigger warning lights and potentially limit engine power.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific DEF system component causing the problem and replace or repair it as necessary. This might involve replacing sensors, pumps, or cleaning/replacing injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Paired with 4.3L V6 and 2.8L Diesel)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or erratic shifting between gears, as well as occasional slipping, especially when cold. This can manifest as a pronounced "clunk" during shifts or hesitation when accelerating.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can resolve minor issues. However, more severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.6L V8)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration felt during light acceleration, often at highway speeds. This is typically caused by wear in the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission flush with a specific fluid can temporarily alleviate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging (Especially under load)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The leaf springs can sag prematurely, especially if the van is frequently used for heavy hauling. This leads to a lowered ride height, reduced load capacity, and potentially poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if the van is consistently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the van sits for extended periods. This can be caused by parasitic draws from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing individual circuits and components to identify the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or exhibit other glitches, requiring a reboot.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve the issue. If not, the infotainment system may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding door can become difficult to open or close, often due to worn rollers or a misaligned track.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn rollers and/or adjust the sliding door track.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor or the blower motor itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 GMC Savana 2500, while a capable work van, does have its share of common issues. Engine oil leaks and exhaust manifold bolt breakage are issues, while transmission problems like harsh shifting and torque converter shudder can be costly. Electrical problems and suspension issues also surface. While not every van will experience all these problems, prospective buyers should be aware of them. The severity of these issues varies, with some being minor inconveniences and others potentially requiring substantial repairs. The cost to fix these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the complexity of the repair.
