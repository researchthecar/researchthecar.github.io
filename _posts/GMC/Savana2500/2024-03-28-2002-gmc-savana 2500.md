**Introduction:**
The 2002 GMC Savana 2500 is a full-size van available in several configurations, including cargo, passenger, and crew cab. It comes standard with a 5.3L V8 engine and a 4-speed automatic transmission, while a 6.0L V8 with a 6-speed automatic transmission is optional. Owners praise the Savana's spacious interior, reliable V8 engines, and towing capacity. However, it has been criticized for its poor fuel economy, dated interior, and limited safety features.

### **Engine**
**5.3L V8 with 4-speed Automatic Transmission**
- **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Loose or cracked intake manifold gasket can cause vacuum leaks, resulting in rough idling, stalling, and decreased performance. **Solution:** Replace the intake manifold gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+

**6.0L V8 with 6-speed Automatic Transmission**
- **Valve Train Wear:** Excessive wear on the lifters, pushrods, or camshaft can lead to engine noise, decreased power, and eventually engine failure. **Solution:** Replace worn valve train components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $3,000+

### **Transmission**
**4-speed Automatic Transmission**
- **Torque Converter Failure:** Failure of the torque converter may cause shuddering, slipping, or overheating of the transmission. **Solution:** Replace the torque converter. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $800 - $1,500+

**6-speed Automatic Transmission**
