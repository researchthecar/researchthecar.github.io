The 2008 GMC Savana 2500 is a popular full-size van known for its durability and versatility. It offers various configurations for both passenger and cargo hauling. Engine options included a 4.8L V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (301 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque or 323 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque depending on the RPO code of the engine). All engine options were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Savana 2500 for its ample cargo space and towing capacity but criticize its fuel economy and dated interior.
