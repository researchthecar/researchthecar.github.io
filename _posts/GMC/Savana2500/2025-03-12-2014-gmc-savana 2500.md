The 2014 GMC Savana 2500 is a full-size cargo van known for its ruggedness and utility. Engine options include a 4.8L V8, a 6.0L V8, and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel. The 4.8L V8 engine produces 280 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the Savana's spacious cargo area and strong towing capacity. Some common complaints include dated interior design, relatively poor fuel economy, and handling characteristics typical of a large van. Itâ€™s a workhorse, but not particularly refined.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8 (L20)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust and a noticeable drop in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause is key. Potential fixes include replacing PCV valve, valve seals, or piston rings depending on the extent of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve), $500 - $2,000+ (Valve Seals, Piston Rings)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8 (L96)**

*   **AFM Lifter Failure (If equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.0L V8 can be equipped with Active Fuel Management (AFM), which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. AFM lifters are prone to failure, leading to a tapping or knocking noise, misfires, and potentially engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, and often replacing all AFM lifters to prevent future issues. Some choose to disable AFM altogether with aftermarket devices or a tune.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (LML)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Fuel injector failure causes hard starts, rough idling, black smoke from the exhaust, and decreased fuel economy. Can also cause fuel to enter the engine oil.
    * Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CP4 fuel pump is known for potential failure due to its design and sensitivity to fuel quality. Failure results in metallic debris contaminating the entire fuel system, causing the engine to not start or run poorly.
    *   Solution: Replace the CP4 fuel pump and often the entire fuel system including injectors, fuel lines, and fuel tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L90 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This can manifest as a shudder or vibration, particularly at lower speeds or during light acceleration. Often described as feeling like driving over rumble strips.
    *   Solution: Performing a triple flush of the transmission fluid with a fluid containing friction modifier additive, or replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (Fluid Flush), $800 - $2,000+ (Torque Converter)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt and harsh shifts between gears, sometimes accompanied by a clunking noise.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low fluid, bad solenoids, or wear within the valve body. A fluid flush and replacement of the filter may resolve it. Otherwise, the valve body or transmission may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (Fluid Flush), $500 - $1500 (Valve Body), $3,000 - $5,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially with heavy use, resulting in a lower ride height and reduced load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs can prevent future sagging if the vehicle is regularly used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of ball joints, leading to clunking noises and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per ball joint
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to lock or unlock properly, or making a buzzing noise. Often, this issue affects one door at a time, but can spread to multiple doors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminating on the dashboard, along with potential loss of ABS functionality. Can also cause issues with the traction control system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing which ABS sensor is faulty and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage/Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the undercarriage and frame, especially in areas exposed to road salt. This can compromise the structural integrity of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Applying rust inhibitor, removing rust, and/or welding in new metal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Rust Inhibitor), $500 - $5,000+ (Welding/Frame Repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blower motor stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents. Sometimes, the blower motor only works on certain speed settings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor and potentially the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 GMC Savana 2500, while a dependable work van, is prone to several issues, some of which can be costly to repair. Engine problems, particularly related to oil consumption and lifter failure (if equipped with AFM), can be severe. Transmission issues, such as torque converter shudder, are also prevalent. Suspension and electrical issues are fairly typical for a vehicle of this age and use. Owners should be vigilant about maintenance and address any symptoms promptly to prevent more extensive damage. The potential cost of repairs ranges from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. The Duramax diesel version is more reliable but has more expensive repairs if problems arise.
