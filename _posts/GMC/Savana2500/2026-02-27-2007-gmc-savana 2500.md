### Summary Verdict
The 2007 GMC Savana 2500 generally offers good reliability, especially with the simpler 4.3L V6 and 4L80-E transmission. However, the more powerful V8 engines, particularly the 5.3L with Active Fuel Management, can be prone to costly lifter issues. Transmission problems, primarily with the 4L60-E, often involve the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear out due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are not uncommon. Overall, while capable, potential buyers should be aware of these specific potential failure points and factor in maintenance costs accordingly.
