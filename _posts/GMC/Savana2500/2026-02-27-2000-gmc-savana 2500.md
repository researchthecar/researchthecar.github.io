### Summary Verdict
The 2000 GMC Savana 2500 is a capable and generally reliable van, particularly for its intended commercial use. The Vortec V8 engines are known for their power but can be susceptible to intake manifold gasket leaks and, in some cases, head gasket issues. Automatic transmissions, especially the 4L60-E, may require attention to the torque converter or solenoids. Common wear items on the suspension, such as ball joints and leaf springs, are expected for a vehicle of this size and age. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can occur. Rust is a significant concern for exterior durability. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing known issues promptly, the Savana 2500 can continue to serve effectively.
