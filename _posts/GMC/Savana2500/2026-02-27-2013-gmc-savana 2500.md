### Summary Verdict
The 2013 GMC Savana 2500 demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly for its intended commercial use. The V8 engines, while robust, can experience issues like cooling system leaks and, in the case of the 5.3L, potential problems with the Active Fuel Management system. Transmission reliability is decent, though older 4-speed units may see torque converter or solenoid issues, while the 6-speed can have fluid leaks or shifting concerns. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, as expected in a heavy-duty vehicle. Electrical components such as alternators and power window motors are common failure points across many vehicles. Overall, with regular maintenance and addressing specific known issues, the Savana 2500 can remain a dependable work vehicle.
