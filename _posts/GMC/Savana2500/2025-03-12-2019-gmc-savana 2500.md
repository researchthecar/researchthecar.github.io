The 2019 GMC Savana 2500 is a full-size work van known for its robust capabilities and utilitarian design. It's appreciated for its ample cargo space, payload capacity, and straightforward, easy-to-maintain mechanicals. However, its dated design, fuel economy, and handling are common complaints. The 2019 Savana 2500 offers two engine options: a 4.3L V6 producing 276 hp and 298 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.0L V8 generating 341 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.0L V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report high oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to fouled spark plugs, catalytic converter damage, and eventually engine failure if left unaddressed. The specific cause can vary, but often involves worn piston rings, valve seals, or issues with the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) system.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source of the oil consumption. Depending on the cause, the solution can range from replacing the PCV valve to a more involved engine rebuild including replacing piston rings and valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV Valve) - $3,000+ (Engine Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.3L V6**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between gears. Slipping during acceleration or delayed engagement is also reported. This can be caused by worn valve body components, internal clutch damage, or low transmission fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or burnt, a fluid and filter change may help. If the problem persists, further diagnostics are needed to determine if valve body repair or transmission rebuild/replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Fluid/Filter Change) - $3,000+ (Transmission Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of excessive play or looseness in the front suspension, often accompanied by clunking noises, uneven tire wear, and poor handling. This is frequently attributed to premature wear of the upper and lower ball joints.
    *   Solution: Inspect ball joints for play. Replacement of worn ball joints is necessary. It's recommended to replace both upper and lower ball joints on the affected side.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty ABS Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminates on the dashboard, potentially accompanied by a loss of ABS functionality. Diagnostic codes indicate a fault with one or more of the ABS wheel speed sensors.
    *   Solution: Identify the faulty ABS sensor using a scan tool. Replace the defective sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failing Fuel Pump Relay**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete engine stalling due to fuel pump failure. The vehicle may crank but not start. Replacing the fuel pump relay can temporarily resolve the issue, but the problem often recurs.
    *   Solution: Replace the fuel pump relay with an updated or heavy-duty relay designed to handle the load.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50 (Relay) plus labor if professionally installed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the side sliding door, particularly in cold weather. The door may bind, stick, or require excessive force to operate. This can be caused by worn rollers, misaligned tracks, or damaged latches.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rollers, tracks, and latches for damage or misalignment. Lubricate the rollers and tracks. If necessary, replace worn rollers or adjust the track alignment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (Lubrication/Adjustment) - $400+ (Roller/Track Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent or weak airflow from the air conditioning system, even when set to maximum cooling. This is often attributed to a failing blend door actuator, a refrigerant leak, or a clogged evaporator core.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the problem. If the blend door actuator is faulty, replace it. If there is a refrigerant leak, locate and repair the leak, then recharge the system. If the evaporator core is clogged, it may need to be cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Blend Door Actuator) - $200 - $800+ (Refrigerant Leak Repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 GMC Savana 2500, while a capable work vehicle, does exhibit some common issues. The excessive oil consumption in the 6.0L V8 is a potentially serious problem that can be costly to address. Transmission problems, while less frequent, can also lead to expensive repairs. Suspension and electrical issues are relatively common and typically involve less expensive fixes. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase. Pre-purchase inspections from a trusted mechanic is highly recommended.
