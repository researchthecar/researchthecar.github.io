The 2018 GMC Savana 2500 is a full-size work van known for its robust build, spacious cargo area, and generally reliable performance. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. Engine options for this year include a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.0L V8 (341 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), both paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (Hydra-Matic 6L80). Some owners appreciate the Savana's simple, utilitarian design and capability, while others dislike its outdated interior, poor fuel economy, and relatively rough ride.

**Summary**

The 2018 GMC Savana 2500, while generally reliable, is prone to a few common issues. The most concerning are related to the 6.0L V8 engine's AFM system and the 6L80 transmission. AFM lifter failures can be costly, and transmission issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs. Suspension components such as leaf springs and ball joints can also wear out, especially with heavy use. Electrical issues are relatively uncommon, and interior and exterior issues are generally minor. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
