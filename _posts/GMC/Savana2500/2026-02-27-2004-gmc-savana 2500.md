### Summary Verdict
The 2004 GMC Savana 2500, while generally a durable vehicle, exhibits some common issues that owners should be aware of. The Vortec V8 engines, particularly the 5.3L, can be prone to Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter failures and intake manifold gasket leaks. The 4L60-E transmission is also a point of concern, with torque converter clutch issues and overheating being reported. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM, and exterior rust are also potential problems. Despite these potential issues, with proper maintenance and addressing these known weaknesses, the Savana 2500 can remain a reliable work van.
