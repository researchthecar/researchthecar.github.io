The 2005 GMC Savana 2500 is a full-size van known for its reliability, cargo capacity, and versatility. It's a popular choice for tradespeople, delivery services, and families needing a spacious vehicle. The Savana 2500 offered multiple engine options including a 4.3L V6 (200 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (295 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were primarily the 4L60-E and 4L80-E four-speed automatic. Owners often praise the van's robust build and utility, but some common complaints include fuel economy, particularly with the larger V8 engines, and issues related to the vehicle's age, such as rust and worn suspension components.

**Summary**

The 2005 GMC Savana 2500, while a reliable workhorse, is prone to certain age-related issues. Engine problems like oil consumption (particularly in the 5.3L V8) and exhaust manifold issues (6.0L V8) can be costly. Transmission issues can be severe, potentially requiring a full rebuild or replacement. Suspension components also wear down, leading to ride quality and handling issues. Electrical gremlins such as door lock actuators and fuel pump failures are common. Rust is also a serious concern, particularly in areas prone to road salt. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission work, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
