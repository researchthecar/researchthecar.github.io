    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, leading to the need for frequent oil top-offs. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust, especially during start-up.
    * Solution: Could range from replacing the PCV valve, valve seals, or piston rings to replacing the engine if the problem is severe.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV) to $3000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Train Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noises from the engine, particularly at idle or low speeds. Could indicate worn lifters or other valvetrain components.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the source of the noise, followed by replacement of worn components.

**5.3L V8**

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 5.3L V8 equipped with Active Fuel Management (AFM) can experience issues with oil consumption, misfires, and engine failure. The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but it can lead to problems with the lifters and valve train. Symptoms include rough idling, check engine light, and reduced power.
    * Solution: Replacing AFM lifters, disabling AFM via tuning, or replacing the engine if the damage is severe.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
