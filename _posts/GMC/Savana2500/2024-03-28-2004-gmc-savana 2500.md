**Introduction:**

The 2004 GMC Savana 2500 is a full-size van available with various engine and transmission configurations. It offers ample cargo space, making it a preferred choice for commercial and personal use. Its powerful engines deliver impressive performance, but the vehicle has received its fair share of complaints regarding certain components.

**Engine**

**5.3L V8**
- **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** A faulty intake manifold gasket can leak coolant, leading to overheating and reduced engine performance. Replace the gaskets with upgraded versions. **$500 - $800+**
- **Timing Chain Failure:** Over time, the timing chain can wear out, resulting in engine stalling or difficulty starting. Replace the timing chain and associated components. **$1,000 - $2,000+**
- **Piston Ring Failure:** Worn or damaged piston rings can cause excessive oil consumption and blue smoke from the exhaust. Rebuild the engine with new piston rings and related parts. **$2,000 - $4,000+**

**6.0L V8**
- **Intake Valve Failure:** In some cases, the intake valves may crack or break due to excessive heat, causing engine misfiring and reduced power. Replace the affected valves and associated parts. **$1,500 - $2,500+**
- **Exhaust Manifold Bolt Failure:** The bolts securing the exhaust manifold can loosen or break, causing exhaust leaks. Replace the bolts and use upgraded versions for better durability. **$200 - $500+**
- **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure:** A faulty oil pressure sensor can provide inaccurate readings, potentially leading to engine damage. Replace the sensor with a genuine OEM part. **$100 - $200+**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**
- **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter can fail over time, causing transmission slippage, overheating, and loss of power. Replace the torque converter and related components. **$1,500 - $2,000+**
- **Valve Body Failure:** A malfunctioning valve body can lead to harsh shifting, delayed engagement, or slipping. Replace the valve body or rebuild the transmission. **$1,000 - $1,500+**

**5-Speed Manual**
- **Clutch Failure:** The clutch may wear out over time, resulting in difficulty shifting gears or slipping. Replace the clutch and flywheel. **$600 - $1,000+**
- **Transmission Mount Failure:** Worn or damaged transmission mounts can cause excessive vibration and gear noise. Replace the mounts with upgraded versions for better support. **$500 - $700+**

**Suspension**

- **Front Ball Joint Failure:** The ball joints in the front suspension can wear out or seize, potentially leading to steering problems and uneven tire wear. Replace the ball joints and inspect the suspension components. **$500 - $1,000+**
- **Rear Axle Seal Leakage:** The rear axle seals can fail over time, allowing fluid to leak out. This can lead to reduced braking performance and premature wear of the differential components. Replace the seals and refill the fluid. **$200 - $500+**
- **Leaf Spring Breakage:** The leaf springs in the rear suspension can break or sag, affecting handling and ride quality. Replace the leaf springs with upgraded versions for better durability. **$1,000 - $1,500+**

**Electrical**

- **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, causing a loss of electrical power. Replace the alternator and inspect the charging system components. **$500 - $700+**
- **Battery Drain:** A parasitic drain can deplete the battery over time, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle. Inspect the electrical system for faulty components or wiring issues. **$200 - $500+**
- **Headlight Switch Failure:** The headlight switch may fail, causing the headlights to malfunction or stay on continuously. Replace the switch and inspect the wiring harness. **$200 - $300+**

- **Door Handle Breakage:** The plastic door handles can become brittle over time and break easily. Replace the handles with upgraded versions or repair them using epoxy. **$100 - $300+**

**Interior**

- **Dash Panel Squeaks and Rattles:** The dash panel may develop squeaks and rattles due to loose or misaligned components. Inspect the panel for any loose screws or clips and tighten them accordingly. **DIY**
- **Seat Belt Buckle Failure:** The seat belt buckles can become faulty, causing the seat belts to lock or fail to engage. Replace the buckles and ensure proper functionality. **$100 - $200+**
- **Climate Control Issues:** The climate control system may malfunction or fail to provide adequate heating or cooling. Inspect the system components, including the compressor, condenser, and evaporator, for leaks or blockages. **Varies depending on issue**
