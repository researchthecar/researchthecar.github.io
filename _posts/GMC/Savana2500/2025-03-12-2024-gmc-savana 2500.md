The 2024 GMC Savana 2500 is a full-size cargo and passenger van, known for its utilitarian design and robust capabilities. It offers a practical solution for businesses and individuals needing a vehicle for hauling cargo or transporting multiple passengers. The Savana is appreciated for its simplicity, reliability, and ease of maintenance, making it a workhorse for various applications. However, it's often criticized for its outdated design, lower fuel efficiency compared to newer vans, and limited modern features.

The 2024 Savana 2500 offers two engine options: a 4.3L V6 producing 276 horsepower and 298 lb-ft of torque and a 6.6L V8 producing 401 horsepower and 464 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.
