### Summary Verdict
The 2009 GMC Savana 2500 is a capable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The Vortec V8 engines, particularly the 5.3L, can be prone to Active Fuel Management (AFM) related problems and intake manifold gasket leaks. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60-E, can include torque converter and solenoid failures. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention due to the vehicle's utility focus. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these potential repairs should be factored into the ownership cost, especially for higher-mileage examples.
