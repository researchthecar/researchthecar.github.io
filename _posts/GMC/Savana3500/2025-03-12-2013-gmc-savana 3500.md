Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2013 GMC Savana 3500, organized by category and powertrain configuration. The 2013 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size van popular for its utility, cargo capacity, and capability for upfitting into various commercial and recreational configurations. Engine options include a 4.8L Vortec V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L Vortec V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (260 hp, 525 lb-ft of torque). All engine options are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Savana's robust build and hauling capabilities, but common dislikes include fuel economy, ride quality, and outdated interior features.

**Engine**

**4.8L Vortec V8**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between oil changes. This may be accompanied by blue exhaust smoke.
    * Solution: The fix can range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive engine work such as piston ring replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Vortec V8**

* **Exhaust Manifold Bolt Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts, resulting in exhaust leaks, ticking noises (especially upon cold start), and reduced fuel economy.
    * Solution: Removal of broken bolts and replacement with new, often upgraded, bolts. In some cases, the exhaust manifold itself may need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (LML)**

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, white smoke, and potential diesel fuel contamination of the engine oil. Can also cause excessive black smoke.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors, fuel filter service, and oil change.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, reduced engine power, and potential for DPF clogging. This can be exacerbated by short trips and infrequent highway driving. Error codes related to the DPF system will be present.
    * Solution: Forced regeneration, DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, whining noises from the turbocharger, and potential for oil leaks.
    * Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, especially during light acceleration or while maintaining speed around 40-60 mph.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush, and replacement with a fluid specifically designed to address shudder issues (such as a fluid with a modified friction modifier package). In severe cases, torque converter replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard or delayed shifts, especially between certain gears. Can also manifest as slipping or a complete loss of drive.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair underlying issues. Fluid change, valve body replacement, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear end sag, especially when loaded. Visual inspection may reveal cracked or broken leaf springs.
    * Solution: Replacement of leaf springs, often with upgraded or heavy-duty options.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front end, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery light illumination, dimming headlights, and eventual battery drain leading to the vehicle not starting.
    * Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Roller Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door, grinding noises, and potential damage to the door track.

**Summary**

The 2013 GMC Savana 3500 is a robust work van that can face various issues with age and usage. Engine problems like oil consumption and exhaust manifold leaks (especially in the gas engines) and fuel injector issues (specifically in the Duramax diesel) can be significant. Transmission shudder and shifting problems are also common and can be costly to address. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, are prone to wear due to the van's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues like door lock actuators and alternator failures are relatively minor annoyances. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs spanning from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the complexity of the fix.
