The 2009 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size van known for its robust build and cargo/passenger hauling capabilities. Available engine options included a 4.8L V8, a 5.3L V8, and a 6.0L V8. The 6.0L V8 engine produced around 300 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque. It was available with the 4L80E 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Savana's reliability, ease of maintenance, and cargo capacity. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, ride quality, and the aging interior design.

**Engine**

**6.0L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing valve seals and/or piston rings. In severe cases, engine replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts, leading to exhaust leaks, a ticking noise (especially when the engine is cold), and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts, often requiring extraction. Sometimes, the manifold itself needs replacement if warped or cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, ticking noises, and potential engine damage due to collapsed lifters on cylinders deactivated by the AFM system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the AFM lifters with non-AFM lifters and disabling the AFM system via a tune. Full engine rebuild may be necessary if damage is extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.8L V8**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4L80E 4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. Slipping during acceleration or gear changes.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and filter change might temporarily alleviate the issue. Often requires valve body repair or replacement. Full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load capacity, and potential cracking of the leaf springs. Can lead to poor ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if frequently hauling heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Loose steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks failing to lock or unlock consistently, or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Panel Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning, flickering lights, or complete failure of the instrument panel cluster.
    *   Solution: Replacing the instrument panel cluster or sending it for repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Lower Body Panels)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the lower body panels, especially around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and door bottoms. More prevalent in areas with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair involves removing the rust, patching the affected area (if necessary), and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ (depending on severity)

**Summary**

The 2009 GMC Savana 3500, while a dependable work van, is prone to several issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption and potential AFM lifter failure in the 5.3L V8, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues such as harsh shifting might necessitate a rebuild. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are also common wear points. Electrical problems, such as door lock actuator and instrument panel cluster failures, can be frustrating to deal with. Rust on the lower body panels is a concern, especially in colder climates. While some issues are minor, others can lead to costly repairs, with potential engine work being the most expensive. Careful inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
