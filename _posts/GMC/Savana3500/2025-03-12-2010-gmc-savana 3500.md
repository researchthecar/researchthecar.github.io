The 2010 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size cargo and passenger van known for its utility and durability. While not celebrated for its refinement or fuel economy, it is appreciated for its spaciousness, payload capacity, and relatively simple mechanics making it a popular choice for commercial use and large families. Dislikes often center on its outdated design, lower fuel economy, and basic interior features compared to more modern vans. The 2010 Savana 3500 offered three engine options: a 4.8L V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were typically a 4-speed automatic or a 6-speed automatic, depending on the engine and configuration.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported increased oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil changes or top-offs between changes. This can lead to spark plug fouling and catalytic converter damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any leaks promptly can help mitigate the issue. Switching to a higher viscosity oil or repairing or replacing the valve cover gaskets may provide temporary relief. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil top-off) to $5000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking noise from the engine, rough idle, misfires, and a loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters is one solution, but a more permanent fix is to disable the AFM system, which can be done through reprogramming the engine control unit (ECU). Upgrading to non-AFM lifters is also a good option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken valve springs.
    *   Solution: Valve spring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4L60E)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear shifts, slipping gears, and overall poor shifting performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Sometimes, this may require rebuilding the transmission as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (6L80E)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear or during downshifts. Slipping can also occur, especially under heavy load.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve some shifting issues. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (software update) to $4000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the van sagging, reduced load-carrying capacity, and a rougher ride, especially when loaded. Broken leaf springs can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs with new or upgraded springs. Airbag assist systems can also be added to improve load-carrying capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks failing to lock or unlock, sometimes intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery not charging, dimming headlights, and eventual complete electrical system failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the lower body panels, particularly the rocker panels and around the wheel arches. Common in areas with road salt.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the rusted panels, followed by rustproofing treatment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on the severity and extent of rust
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dash cover, replacement dash, or professional repair/refinishing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (dash cover) to $1000+ (dash replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 GMC Savana 3500 can present several issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly those related to AFM lifters in the 5.3L V8 and valve springs in the 6.0L, are some of the more serious concerns. Transmission issues can range from minor shifting problems to complete failure, depending on the unit. Other common problems include suspension wear, electrical component failures, and rust. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some requiring relatively inexpensive fixes while others may necessitate significant repairs or even component replacements. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
