### Summary Verdict
The 2011 GMC Savana 3500 is a workhorse vehicle that, while generally durable, exhibits some common issues typical for its age and class. The Vortec V8 engines, particularly the 5.3L with its AFM system, can be prone to specific problems like oil leaks and internal component wear. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60-E, often involve the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also noted for wear. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and power window motors are not uncommon. Rust can be a concern on exterior panels, particularly in corrosive environments. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor and door lock actuators may require replacement over time. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential issues can help maintain the Savana's reliability for its intended heavy-duty use.
