The 2015 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size van designed for cargo or passenger transport, offering a blend of utility and practicality. Engine options for this year include a 4.8L Vortec V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft torque), a 6.0L Vortec V8 (342 hp, 373 lb-ft torque), and a 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (260 hp, 525 lb-ft torque). All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Savana for its spacious interior, payload capacity, and robust build. Common criticisms include its outdated design, fuel economy, and ride quality compared to newer vans.

**Engine**

**4.8L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between changes. This can lead to fouled spark plugs and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly, using a higher viscosity oil (if appropriate), and addressing any oil leaks promptly. In some cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary, but is not always applicable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause and extent of damage; $300 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between changes. This can lead to fouled spark plugs and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly, using a higher viscosity oil (if appropriate), and addressing any oil leaks promptly. In some cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary, but is not always applicable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause and extent of damage; $300 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8**
* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, white smoke from the exhaust, and a decrease in fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per injector.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration during light acceleration or when the transmission is in overdrive, typically between 30-45 mph. The shudder might feel like driving over rumble strips.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with updated fluid. In more severe cases, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush: $200-$400, Torque Converter Replacement: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sag, reduced load-carrying capacity, and a harsh ride. Leaf springs can also crack or break, posing a safety hazard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty leaf springs may be beneficial for vehicles frequently carrying heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front End Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of front end components, such as ball joints, tie rod ends, and control arm bushings. Symptoms include loose steering, uneven tire wear, and noises coming from the front suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn components. Regular lubrication of greaseable parts can help extend their lifespan.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is parked. This can make it difficult to start the vehicle, particularly after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the parasitic draw by testing individual circuits and components. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty door switches, and malfunctioning modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks. The doors may not lock or unlock using the key fob or interior switch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting Around Wheel Wells and Rocker Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation around the wheel wells and rocker panels.
    *   Solution: Remove the rust and prevent it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor only works on certain speeds or not at all. This is often caused by a failed blower motor resistor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor. In some cases, the blower motor itself may also need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 GMC Savana 3500, while a capable and utilitarian van, does have its share of potential issues. Oil consumption, especially in the gasoline engines, and torque converter shudder in the transmission are common concerns. Suspension issues, like sagging leaf springs and front-end component wear, can affect ride quality and safety. Electrical problems, such as battery drain and door lock actuator failures, can also be frustrating. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine work or transmission replacement, can be costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchasing.
