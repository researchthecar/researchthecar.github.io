The 2020 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, offering robust capabilities for hauling and towing. Engine options include a 4.3L V6 producing 276 horsepower and 298 lb-ft of torque and a 6.0L V8 producing 341 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque. The 6.0L V8 is a very popular choice for it's added power and reliability. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Savana 3500 for its dependability, cargo capacity, and straightforward design. However, some criticize its dated interior, fuel economy, and basic features compared to more modern vans.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

No Issues Found

**6.0L V8**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between oil changes. This may present as blue smoke from the exhaust or the need to add a quart of oil every few thousand miles.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and using a higher viscosity oil may help. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary, though this is a more invasive repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Hydra-Matic 6L90)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, especially between 1st and 2nd gear or during downshifts. Others have reported slipping in various gears. This can be caused by worn valve body components or internal damage.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush might provide temporary relief. Replacing the valve body or a full transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary for a more permanent fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $1,000 (valve body) - $3,000 - $5,000+ (rebuild/replace)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of excessive battery drain while the vehicle is off. This may be due to an electrical short or a parasitic draw from an accessory or module that is not shutting down properly.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic draw is necessary. This may involve testing fuses, relays, and modules to identify the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Side Door Latch Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulties opening or closing the side cargo doors due to latch mechanism failure. Could be caused by rust, corrosion, or internal component wear.
    * Solution: Replacing the door latch assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The blower motor stops working, resulting in no air circulation from the vents for heating or cooling. This is often caused by a faulty blower motor resistor or the motor itself failing.
    * Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor and/or the blower motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 GMC Savana 3500, while generally a reliable work van, does have some common issues to watch out for. The 6.0L V8 engine may experience oil consumption, and the 6-speed transmission can suffer from harsh shifting or slipping. Electrical problems like battery drain and exterior issues like side door latch failures can also occur. Interior issues are mostly relegated to the HVAC blower motor. The severity of these issues varies, with some being relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, while others require more significant repairs costing several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and inspect the vehicle carefully before purchasing.
