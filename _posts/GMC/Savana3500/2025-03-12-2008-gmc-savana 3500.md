The 2008 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size van known for its utility and durability. It's a popular choice for commercial use and conversion into work vans or recreational vehicles. The 2008 model year offered several engine options: a 4.8L V8 (285 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Savana's robust build and cargo capacity, while common dislikes include its fuel economy, basic interior, and relatively dated design. This report focuses on commonly reported issues, not general wear and tear, and strives for accuracy regarding specific configurations.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report increased oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between changes. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly is crucial. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic should inspect for leaks, worn valve seals, or piston rings. Replacing these components can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the cause and extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks in the exhaust manifold, often near the welds. This leads to exhaust leaks, a ticking sound (especially when cold), and potentially reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cracked exhaust manifold is the common solution. Aftermarket manifolds are often more durable than the originals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The AFM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to problems. Issues can include excessive oil consumption, lifter failure, and engine misfires, as the AFM system is known to cause issues with the number 7 cylinder.
    * Solution: A common fix is to disable the AFM system through reprogramming the ECU. Replacing the lifters or even the camshaft may be necessary if there is significant damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for reprogramming the ECU, $1000-$3000+ for lifter/camshaft replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L, the 5.3L can also experience increased oil consumption, potentially due to worn valve seals or piston rings, particularly in engines with higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and prompt addressing of leaks are vital. A mechanic should inspect for the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts are a common issue on the 6.0L V8. This leads to exhaust leaks, a ticking sound, and potentially reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: The broken bolts need to be extracted and replaced. This can be a challenging repair due to the bolts often being seized.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4L60E)**

*   **Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or harsh shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. This can indicate wear in the clutches or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush *might* temporarily alleviate the problem, but often a rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at certain speeds, especially during lockup of the torque converter. Can also cause stalling or poor acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken Leaves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, reduced load capacity, and potential clunking noises. Broken leaf springs are visually apparent.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs, either with stock replacements or upgraded heavy-duty springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front suspension noise (clunking, squeaking), loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn ball joints. It's often recommended to replace upper and lower ball joints simultaneously.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power door locks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS warning light illuminated, potential loss of ABS functionality, and possible speed sensor issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing which ABS sensor is failing and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially Around Wheel Wells and Rocker Panels)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, particularly in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Rust repair involves removing the rust, treating the metal, and applying new paint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on the severity and extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover. Some owners opt for professional repair services.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (cover) - $500 - $1500+ (replacement/repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 GMC Savana 3500, while a reliable workhorse, does have some common issues. Engine issues, particularly oil consumption and AFM problems in the 5.3L V8, can be costly. Transmission problems, especially with the 4L60E, are also a concern. Suspension wear and electrical glitches are other potential areas of concern. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like engine rebuilds or transmission replacements, can be significant expenses. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
