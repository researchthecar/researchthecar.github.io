The 2012 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size van known for its durability and cargo/passenger hauling capabilities. Engine options include a 4.8L V8 (280 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L V8 (324 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (260 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque). These engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Savana's robust build and towing capacity, but common complaints include poor fuel economy, a basic interior, and some reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2012 GMC Savana 3500, while a capable work van, has a few potential issues to be aware of. Engine problems such as oil consumption (4.8L), AFM lifter failure (6.0L), and fuel injector/glow plug issues (6.6L Duramax) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues like harsh shifting and torque converter failure are also prevalent. Suspension wear and electrical glitches like door lock and alternator failures are common. Rust can also be a significant concern, particularly in areas with harsh winters. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and factor in potential repair costs. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission work can be quite costly.
