### Summary Verdict
The 2004 GMC Savana 3500 offers a robust platform for commercial and passenger transport. While its core powertrain options are generally durable, specific components like intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines on the V8 gasoline engines, and glow plugs/injectors on the Duramax diesel, can be points of concern. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4L60-E, may experience overheating or solenoid issues. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and interior comfort problems like HVAC blower motor failure are also reported. Overall, the Savana 3500 is a capable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
