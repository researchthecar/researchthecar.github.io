The 2005 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size van known for its versatility and workhorse capabilities. Engine options for this year included a 4.3L V6 (200 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (295 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were generally a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Savana's spaciousness, cargo capacity, and robust build, making it suitable for commercial use, conversions, and hauling. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, ride quality, and some age-related reliability issues typical of vehicles of this vintage.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, rough idling, overheating, coolant smell, and low coolant levels.
    * Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Distributor Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, hard starting, stalling, poor performance
    * Solution: Replace the distributor cap, rotor, or entire distributor assembly
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+

**5.3L V8**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from exhaust, low oil pressure.
    * Solution: In some cases, replacing valve seals or piston rings may be necessary, but this can be extensive and costly. Monitoring and topping off the oil regularly is a more common approach for older vehicles.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the severity and chosen repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**
* **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, especially when cold, exhaust leak smell, reduced fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold bolts and potentially the manifold itself if warped.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic**

* **Slipping or Erratic Shifting**

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at low speeds or when accelerating, stalling, transmission overheating.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's often recommended to replace the transmission fluid and filter at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

**Summary**

The 2005 GMC Savana 3500, while a capable van, is prone to certain issues given its age. Engine problems include oil consumption in the 5.3L, exhaust manifold bolts in the 6.0L, and intake manifold leaks in the 4.3L. Transmission issues like slipping are common with the 4L60E. Suspension components such as ball joints and leaf springs can also wear out. Electrically, fuel pump and instrument cluster failures are seen. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs. Estimated costs range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the specific problem and the required repair. Regular maintenance and addressing problems early can help mitigate some of these risks.
