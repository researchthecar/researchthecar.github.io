The 2014 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size cargo and passenger van known for its durability and utility. Engine options include a 4.8L V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft torque), a 6.0L V8 (342 hp, 373 lb-ft torque), and a 6.6L Duramax diesel V8 (260 hp, 525 lb-ft torque). The 4.8L and 6.0L engines are typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (Hydra-Matic 6L90). The Duramax diesel option typically uses a 6-speed Allison automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Savana's spaciousness and towing capacity, but criticize its fuel economy, dated interior, and handling.
