The 2007 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size van known for its durability and workhorse capabilities. It comes in various configurations, including cargo and passenger versions. Engine options include the 4.8L Vortec V8 (295 hp, 305 lb-ft torque), the 5.3L Vortec V8 (310 hp, 335 lb-ft torque), and the 6.0L Vortec V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Savana's spaciousness and towing capacity but often cite fuel economy and ride quality as drawbacks. Its utilitarian design prioritizes function over form, leading to some complaints about interior comfort and refinement.
