The 2016 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, though some are outfitted for passenger transport. It offers a robust and reliable platform, appreciated for its cargo capacity and relatively simple mechanics compared to modern vans. However, it's not known for its fuel efficiency or refined driving experience. The 2016 model offers a few engine choices: the standard 4.8L Vortec V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft torque), the more powerful 6.0L Vortec V8 (342 hp, 373 lb-ft torque), and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I4 (181 hp, 369 lb-ft torque). All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (Hydra-Matic 6L80). Owners generally praise its durability and ease of maintenance, while common complaints revolve around fuel economy and a somewhat outdated interior design.

**Engine**

**4.8L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles, bluish smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by worn valve stem seals or piston rings. Diagnosis typically involves a leak-down test or compression test. Repair might involve replacing the valve stem seals ($800-$1500), or complete engine rebuild/replacement ($3,000 - $6,000+).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.0L Vortec V8, depending on the production date, can suffer from AFM (Active Fuel Management) lifter failure. Symptoms may include ticking noises, rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Disable AFM, new lifters and trays
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I4**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the DEF system can occur, including sensor failures, clogged injectors, and issues with the DEF pump. These problems can cause a reduction in engine power, a "check engine" light, and diagnostic trouble codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty DEF sensors, cleaning or replacing DEF injectors, or replacing the DEF pump. A software update might also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Hydra-Matic 6L80 (All Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a shudder or vibration, particularly at low speeds or during light acceleration. This issue is often linked to the torque converter.
    *   Solution: A fluid flush has been shown to help reduce this issue. Replace the torque converter if the issue comes back or is persistent.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh, erratic, and/or delayed shifts.
    *   Solution: Could require a new transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken**
    * Description/Symptoms: The leaf springs in the rear suspension can sag over time, especially with frequent heavy loads. Broken leaf springs are also possible. This can lead to a decrease in ride height, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaf spring(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining overnight or within a few days of the vehicle sitting idle.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the parasitic drain. Could involve replacing a faulty module or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Side Door Latch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Side cargo doors can experience latch issues causing the door to not open, close, or latch properly.
    * Solution: Replacement of the door latch assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor can fail, resulting in a lack of airflow from the vents. This can affect both heating and cooling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 GMC Savana 3500 can have a few notable issues. Engine issues, particularly oil consumption in the 4.8L Vortec and lifter failure in the 6.0L, can be costly to address. The 6L80 transmission, while generally reliable, can experience torque converter issues and harsh shifting, also potentially leading to expensive repairs. Electrical problems such as battery drain and HVAC blower motor failure, while less severe, can still be inconvenient. The suspension can also sag and need repair on older vehicles. Overall, a thorough inspection, focusing on these common problem areas, is essential before purchasing a used 2016 Savana 3500.
