The 2006 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size van known for its durability and cargo capacity, making it a popular choice for commercial use and conversion vans. The 2006 model year offered several engine options including a 4.3L V6 producing around 195 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, a 4.8L V8 with approximately 285 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, a 5.3L V8 delivering about 295 horsepower and 335 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.0L V8 that produced around 300 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque. Common transmissions paired with these engines were the 4L60-E and 4L80-E four-speed automatic transmissions. Owners often praise the Savana 3500 for its ruggedness and spaciousness, but some complain about fuel economy and the aging design.
