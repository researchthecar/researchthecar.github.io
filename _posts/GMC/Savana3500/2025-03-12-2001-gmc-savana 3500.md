The 2001 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size van known for its utility and cargo capacity. While it's appreciated for its spaciousness and workhorse capabilities, it also has its share of reported problems. Engine options for the 2001 Savana 3500 included the 4.3L Vortec V6 (around 190 hp and 250 lb-ft of torque), the 5.0L Vortec V8 (around 220 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque), the 5.7L Vortec V8 (around 255 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque), and the 7.4L Vortec V8 (around 290 hp and 410 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were typically either a 4L60E or 4L80E 4-speed automatic depending on the engine. Owners often dislike the fuel economy and sometimes cumbersome handling, but appreciate its reliability (when maintained) and ability to handle heavy loads.

**Summary**

The 2001 GMC Savana 3500, while a capable work van, is prone to several age-related issues. Engine and transmission problems can range from minor gasket leaks to major failures requiring rebuilds or replacements, potentially costing thousands. Suspension and electrical problems are also common and can add up over time. Rust is a major concern, especially in colder climates. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for rust, engine leaks, transmission performance, and suspension wear. Pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic is highly recommended. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major repairs to the engine, transmission, or body can be costly.
