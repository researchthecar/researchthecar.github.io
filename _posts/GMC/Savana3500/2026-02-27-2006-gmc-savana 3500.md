### Summary Verdict
The 2006 GMC Savana 3500 is a capable workhorse, but like many vehicles of its age and type, it is not without potential issues. The most common concerns revolve around the engine's intake manifold gaskets and, for V8 models, the Active Fuel Management system. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60-E, can arise, often related to the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components like ball joints are subject to wear, and electrical gremlins, often traced to the BCM or alternator, can occur. Rust is also a consideration for exterior durability. Despite these potential problems, many Savana 3500s remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, making them a viable option for those needing robust cargo or passenger capacity.
