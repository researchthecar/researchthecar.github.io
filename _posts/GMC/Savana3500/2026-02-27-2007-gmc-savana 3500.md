### Summary Verdict
The 2007 GMC Savana 3500 is a capable work van with a generally solid mechanical foundation. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the intake manifold gaskets on V8 engines and the Active Fuel Management system on the 5.3L and 6.0L V8s. Transmission reliability is decent, but torque converter and solenoid issues can arise. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention due to the vehicle's load-carrying nature. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM, and exterior rust are also points to monitor. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of wear can significantly extend the life and reliability of this van.
