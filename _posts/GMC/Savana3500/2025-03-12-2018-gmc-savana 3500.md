The 2018 GMC Savana 3500 is a full-size cargo and passenger van known for its robust build and utility. It's often used for commercial purposes like transporting goods, passengers, or serving as a mobile workshop. Available engine options include the standard 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque), the more powerful 6.0L V8 (341 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). The transmission options were a 6-speed automatic on the gasoline engines and an 8-speed automatic on the Diesel engine. Owners typically appreciate the Savana's spaciousness, payload capacity, and towing capability. Common complaints revolve around the dated design, fuel economy, and ride quality.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6.0L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage due to a failed AFM lifter collapsing. This usually triggers the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder head. Some owners opt to delete the AFM system entirely to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption that requires frequent oil additions. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust, especially on startup.
    *   Solution: Determining the cause of consumption is key. Piston rings, PCV valve, or valve stem seals can be the culprit and will require replacement to resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light related to DEF system malfunctions. These can include faulty DEF sensors, a malfunctioning DEF injector, or a clogged DEF filter. Reduced engine power or a speed limiter may also be activated.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component failure in the DEF system using a scan tool and replace the faulty part. Cleaning or replacing the DEF filter may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic (paired with 4.3L and 6.0L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Slipping during acceleration or delayed engagement can also occur.
    *   Solution: Initially, check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter replacement may resolve minor issues. If the problem persists, valve body issues are common and require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,500+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.8L Duramax Diesel)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension sagging, especially when loaded. Leaf springs may exhibit visible cracking or breakage. This can affect ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected leaf spring(s) with new or reinforced units. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the vehicle is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per spring, depending on the source and type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the door lock actuator, preventing the door from locking or unlocking electronically.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains rapidly, often overnight, preventing the vehicle from starting.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic drain by testing circuits and fuses. Potential causes include faulty aftermarket accessories, a failing alternator, or a short circuit in the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Side Door Latch Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulties opening or closing the sliding side door. The latch mechanism may become stiff or require excessive force to operate.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the latch mechanism with silicone-based lubricant. If the problem persists, the latch assembly may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (lubrication) - $300+ (latch replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
