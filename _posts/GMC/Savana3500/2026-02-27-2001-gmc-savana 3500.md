### Summary Verdict
The 2001 GMC Savana 3500, particularly with its Vortec V8 engines, is generally a durable vehicle. However, common issues like intake manifold gasket leaks and potential head gasket failures on larger engines require attention. Automatic transmissions, especially the 4L60-E, can experience torque converter or solenoid problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Regular maintenance and addressing these specific potential issues proactively can significantly extend the service life of the Savana 3500.
