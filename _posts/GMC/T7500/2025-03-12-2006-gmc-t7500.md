The 2006 GMC T7500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial applications such as hauling, delivery, and utility work. Engine options included the Duramax 6.6L diesel, the Vortec 8.1L V8 gasoline, and the Isuzu 7.8L diesel. Transmission options vary based on the engine, but commonly include Allison automatic transmissions (such as the 1000 and 2000 series). The Duramax 6.6L engine produced around 300-330 horsepower and 520-650 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific configuration. Owners typically appreciate the T7500's robust build, high payload capacity, and suitability for demanding tasks. Common dislikes often include fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine), maintenance costs associated with a commercial-grade vehicle, and potential for issues related to the truck's age and heavy usage.

**Engine**

**Duramax 6.6L Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from exhaust. Can be intermittent at first, worsening over time.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors. Recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Replace faulty glow plugs. Inspect glow plug controller module as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Vortec 8.1L V8 Gasoline**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing sound from the engine, especially when cold. Can eventually lead to exhaust leaks and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Remove broken bolts and replace the exhaust manifold gasket and hardware. This can be difficult due to the bolts often being seized.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes excessive oil, requiring frequent top-offs. Can lead to spark plug fouling and catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the source of oil consumption (e.g., valve stem seals, piston rings). Repair or replace affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the source and extent of the problem)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Isuzu 7.8L Diesel**
*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000/2000 Series (Common to Multiple Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during TCC engagement, stalling, or transmission slipping. Diagnostic trouble codes related to TCC performance.
    *   Solution: Replace torque converter. Inspect transmission fluid for contamination and address any underlying issues causing the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, failure to shift into certain gears. Diagnostic trouble codes related to shift solenoid performance.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty shift solenoid(s). Inspect wiring harness and connectors for damage or corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. Reduced ride quality. Visible cracks or broken leaves in the spring pack.
    *   Solution: Replace sagging or damaged leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs for increased load capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, wandering, uneven tire wear. Clunking or popping sounds from the front suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and tie rod ends. Perform wheel alignment after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, gauges malfunctioning, or starting issues. Common in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair corroded wiring harnesses. Clean and protect connectors. Consider using dielectric grease to prevent future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity and location of the corrosion)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dim headlights, battery not charging, warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty alternator. Test the charging system after installation to ensure proper operation.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame/Cab Corners**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust, especially in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure. Can lead to structural weakening over time.
    *   Solution: Remove rust, repair damaged areas, and apply rust-resistant coatings. Can range from minor surface rust treatment to extensive welding repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 GMC T7500, while a capable and reliable work truck, is prone to certain issues related to its age and commercial usage. Common issues include fuel injector and glow plug problems on the Duramax diesel, exhaust manifold and oil consumption issues on the Vortec gasoline engine. Also shift solenoid issues and torque converter clutch failures are very common on the Allison transmissions. Suspension components, wiring harnesses, and body panels are also susceptible to wear and tear. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, particularly those involving the engine and transmission. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and condition before purchase.
