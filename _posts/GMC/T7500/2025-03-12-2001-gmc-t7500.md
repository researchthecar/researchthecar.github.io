The 2001 GMC T7500 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial use, often utilized for tasks like hauling, delivery, and service applications. Engine options for the 2001 T7500 included the Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine. While specific horsepower and torque figures varied slightly depending on the exact configuration and year, the 3126 typically produced around 250-330 horsepower and 600-860 lb-ft of torque. A popular transmission option was the Allison automatic transmission. Owners appreciated the T7500's ruggedness and workhorse capabilities, but some common complaints included issues related to the aging components, particularly in the engine and electrical systems. These trucks, being older, often present challenges due to wear and tear and the availability of replacement parts.

**Engine**

**Caterpillar 3126 Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, black smoke, poor fuel economy, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors with new or remanufactured units. Recalibration may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector (parts and labor)
