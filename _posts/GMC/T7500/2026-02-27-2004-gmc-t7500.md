### Summary Verdict
The 2004 GMC T7500, equipped with either the Caterpillar 3126B or Isuzu 6HK1-TCS diesel engines and typically paired with an Allison automatic or Eaton Fuller manual transmission, demonstrates a generally robust mechanical foundation suitable for commercial use. Common issues tend to revolve around high-wear components like fuel injectors, turbochargers, and clutch systems, which are expected given the vehicle's intended workload. Electrical system reliability is generally good, though alternator failures and wiring harness corrosion can occur. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs and shock absorbers, may require attention due to constant load. Interior and exterior issues are less critical but can include HVAC functionality and frame rust in areas with harsh climates. Proactive maintenance and timely repairs are key to maximizing the longevity and operational efficiency of the T7500.
