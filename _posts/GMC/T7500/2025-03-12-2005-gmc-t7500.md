Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2005 GMC T7500, formatted for your website and including available engine options. The 2005 GMC T7500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial applications like hauling and delivery. This model year offered several engine options, including the Duramax diesel engines. The Duramax diesel engines were often praised for their reliability and towing capacity. However, some owners reported issues with the Duramax diesel engines such as fuel injector failures and electrical problems. The T7500, being a work truck, prioritized functionality over comfort, which some drivers found basic.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Diesel (LLY)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, white smoke from exhaust, decreased fuel economy. This was a known issue for the LLY Duramax, partly attributed to injector design and fuel quality.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors with updated design if available. Ensure proper fuel filtration.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ (depending on number of injectors replaced and labor rates).
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rising temperature gauge, coolant loss, steam from the engine bay, potential engine damage.  Can be caused by a clogged radiator, failing water pump, or faulty thermostat.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty cooling system components. Flush and refill the cooling system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
