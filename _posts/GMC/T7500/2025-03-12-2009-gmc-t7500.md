The 2009 GMC T7500 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications. It offers versatility for various tasks, including hauling, delivery, and construction. While known for its robust build and utility, owners have reported certain common issues. Available engine options included the Duramax 6.6L diesel and the Vortec 8.1L gas engine. The Duramax 6.6L produces around 330 horsepower and 620 lb-ft of torque. The Vortec 8.1L produces around 325 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque. Transmissions include the Allison 1000 series automatic. Owners appreciate the T7500's hauling capacity and reliability for demanding work, but some dislike its fuel economy and rough ride.
