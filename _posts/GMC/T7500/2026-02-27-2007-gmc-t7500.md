### Summary Verdict
The 2007 GMC T7500, like many heavy-duty commercial vehicles, is built for durability but can experience specific issues related to its powertrain and chassis components. The diesel engines, particularly the Duramax and Caterpillar options, are prone to fuel system and exhaust aftertreatment problems, as well as turbocharger and cooling system leaks. Transmissions, both automatic and manual, can suffer from leaks, torque converter issues, or clutch wear. Suspension components like leaf springs may require replacement due to stress. Electrical systems can be affected by alternator failures and wiring corrosion. Exterior rust is a common concern for trucks of this age, especially in certain climates. Interior issues often center around the HVAC system. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the reliability of these workhorses.
