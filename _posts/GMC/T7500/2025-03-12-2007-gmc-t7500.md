The 2007 GMC T7500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial purposes. It offered a range of engine and transmission options to suit various needs. While generally considered a reliable workhorse, some common issues have been reported by owners. The T7500 provides a good balance of capability and affordability, but some owners have reported the ride to be fairly stiff and handling less responsive than lighter-duty trucks. Engine options include the Duramax 6.6L diesel V8 and the Vortec 8.1L gas V8. The Duramax is favored for its power (rated around 330 HP and 620 lb-ft of torque) and fuel efficiency in demanding applications, while the Vortec offers a lower initial cost but sacrifices fuel economy. Transmission options included Allison automatic transmissions, with the specific model varying depending on the engine and application.
