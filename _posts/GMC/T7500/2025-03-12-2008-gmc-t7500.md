The 2008 GMC T7500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial purposes like delivery, construction, and utility work. Engine options for this model year include the Duramax 6.6L diesel engine (rated around 300-330 hp and 520-620 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tune) and the Vortec 8.1L gasoline engine (rated around 325 hp and 440 lb-ft of torque). The most common transmission choices were the Allison 1000 series automatic. Owners appreciate the T7500's robust build and hauling capacity, but common complaints revolve around maintenance costs, diesel engine emissions systems, and the overall ride quality.

**Summary**

The 2008 GMC T7500 is a workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the diesel engine emissions systems and the Allison transmission. Engine-related issues can be costly, especially fuel injector and turbocharger failures on the Duramax, and intake manifold leaks and oil consumption on the Vortec. Transmission problems like torque converter issues and shift solenoid failures can also be expensive to fix. Suspension wear is expected on a truck of this age and duty, and electrical gremlins can be frustrating. Rust can also be a significant issue. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing or potential problems.
