### Summary Verdict
The 2008 GMC T7500, particularly with the gasoline engine option, demonstrates good overall reliability. The Isuzu diesel engine, while powerful and efficient, has a higher propensity for issues related to fuel injectors and the EGR system, which are common in many modern diesel powertrains. Transmission reliability is generally strong, with the Allison automatics being a robust choice, though torque converter issues can arise. Electrical components like alternators and wiring harnesses are the most frequently cited areas for potential problems, which is not uncommon for commercial vehicles of this age. Exterior and interior components are typically durable. Proactive maintenance, especially on the diesel engine's emissions system and the electrical charging system, is recommended for optimal long-term performance and to mitigate potential costly repairs.
