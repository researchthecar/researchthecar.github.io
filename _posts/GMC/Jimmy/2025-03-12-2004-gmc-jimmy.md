The 2004 GMC Jimmy is a compact SUV that was produced by General Motors. It was available with a 4.3L V6 engine, producing around 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. The engine was available with either a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission. People liked the Jimmy for its ruggedness, off-road capability (especially in 4x4 models), and relatively low price. However, it was also criticized for its dated interior, mediocre fuel economy, and reliability issues.
