The 2001 GMC Jimmy is a compact SUV known for its truck-like body-on-frame construction and off-road capability. It's a no-frills vehicle appealing to those seeking a robust and relatively inexpensive SUV. However, its age also means owners often encounter issues stemming from wear and tear. Engine options included the 4.3L V6, producing approximately 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 4-speed automatic (4L60E) or a 5-speed manual transmission. The Jimmy offers a decent amount of cargo space and a relatively comfortable ride for its class. Dislikes often revolve around fuel economy, dated interior, and reliability concerns due to its age.
