The 2015 GMC Savana 4500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, offering robust capability and ample cargo space. Itâ€™s available with a few different engine options, including a 4.8L V8 producing 280 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, a 6.0L V8 generating 342 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8, which puts out 260 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque. The 4.8L V8 is typically paired with a 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.0L V8 is usually paired with a 6L90E six-speed automatic transmission. There is also a CNG version of the 6.0L V8. Owners generally appreciate the Savana 4500's reliability, spaciousness, and workhorse capabilities. Common complaints include its relatively outdated design, lower fuel economy compared to newer vans, and basic interior features.

**Summary**

The 2015 GMC Savana 4500, while generally reliable, can experience issues across various components. Engine issues, particularly oil consumption and catalytic converter failure in the gasoline engines, and DPF problems and fuel injector failures in the diesel engine, are common and can range from relatively inexpensive to costly repairs. Transmission problems, such as torque converter shudder and harsh shifting, can also be problematic. Suspension issues such as leaf spring sagging and worn ball joints affect the vehicle's handling and ride comfort. Electrical issues like faulty door lock actuators and battery drain, as well as exterior issues with the sliding door, and interior HVAC and seat belt problems also occur. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but some, especially those related to the engine and transmission, can lead to significant expenses.
