Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
- **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail, resulting in reduced engine power and increased fuel consumption. Replacing the turbocharger typically fixes the issue.
Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**4.8L V8**
- **Oil Consumption:** Some 4.8L V8 engines have been reported to consume excessive oil. Replacing the piston rings and valve seals can mitigate the issue.
Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $1,800+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**
- **Harsh Shifting:** The transmission may shift harshly or jerk during gear changes. Rebuilding or replacing the transmission is usually necessary.
