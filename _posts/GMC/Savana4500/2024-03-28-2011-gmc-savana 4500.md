**Engine**

* **6.0L Vortec V8**
    * **Excessive Oil Consumption:** Some owners report excessive oil consumption, leading to engine damage.
    * **Fuel Injector Failure:** Malfunctioning fuel injectors can cause rough idling, poor performance, and increased emissions.
    * **Cylinder Head Gasket Failure:** Leaking cylinder head gaskets can result in coolant and oil mixing, leading to overheating and potential engine failure.
    * **Recalls:** NHTSA Recall Numbers: 14V-450, 16V-182, 18V-134

* **6.6L Duramax V8**
    * **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger may fail, resulting in reduced power and decreased fuel economy.
    * **EGR System Issues:** Problems with the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system can cause engine performance issues and increased emissions.
    * **Injector Sticking:** Occasionally, the injectors may stick open, resulting in fuel dilution of the engine oil and potential damage.
    * **Recalls:** NHTSA Recall Number: 15V-028

**Transmission**

* **4L85-E 4-Speed Automatic**
    * **Slipping Gears:** The transmission may slip or fail to engage gears smoothly.
    * **Overheating:** Excessive transmission heat can lead to premature component failure.
    * **Valve Body Failure:** A malfunctioning valve body can affect shift patterns and cause harsh shifts.
    * **Recalls:** NHTSA Recall Number: 11V-334

* **6L90-E 6-Speed Automatic**
    * **Delayed Engagement:** The transmission may delay engagement from a stop or hesitate when shifting gears.
    * **Solenoid Issues:** Electrical problems with the transmission solenoids can cause erratic shifting or loss of gear engagement.
    * **Input Shaft Bushing Wear:** Premature wear on the input shaft bushing can lead to noise and vibration while driving.
