Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2011 GMC Savana 4500, categorized for clarity and consistency.

The 2011 GMC Savana 4500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, known for its robust build and cargo capacity. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (gasoline) producing around 324 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.6L Duramax V8 (diesel) which was available in previous years but may have seen limited availability or was phasing out by 2011, producing around 365 hp and 660 lb-ft of torque if it were still available. Transmission options generally included a 4-speed automatic (4L80E) and a 6-speed automatic (Hydra-Matic 6L90). Owners generally appreciate the Savana's durability and practicality for work, but often cite concerns about fuel economy, ride comfort, and the aging design and technology. The Savana's utilitarian focus can also mean a lack of modern amenities compared to newer vans.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 (Gasoline)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Can lead to fouled spark plugs and catalytic converter damage if left unaddressed.
