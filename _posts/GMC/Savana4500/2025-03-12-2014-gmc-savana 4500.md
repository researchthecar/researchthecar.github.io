The 2014 GMC Savana 4500 is a heavy-duty full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes. While it offers substantial cargo and passenger capacity, buyers should be aware of potential issues. The 2014 Savana 4500 was offered with several engine options including a 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 324 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque and a 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 producing 260 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Savana's robust build and utility, but some common complaints involve reliability and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, sometimes accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust. Some have reported consuming a quart of oil every 1,000 miles.
    *   Solution: The issue is commonly caused by the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system causing excess wear and tear on the cylinders. Some have reported repairing with updated valve cover assembly, PCV system components, or replacing the piston rings. In more severe cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$5,000+

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes indicating catalytic converter inefficiency (e.g., P0420, P0430). Reduced engine performance, and potential failure to pass emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter. The oxygen sensors are usually inspected and sometimes replaced at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential difficulty starting. Diagnostic trouble codes related to fuel injector performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s) and inspection of the fuel system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, reduced fuel economy, and potential for engine damage if regeneration is interrupted. Diagnostic trouble codes related to DPF performance.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF, replacement of the DPF, or cleaning of the DPF, depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration during light acceleration, typically between 30-50 mph.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement, transmission flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the van sagging, especially when loaded. Visible cracks in the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a short period, requiring frequent jump-starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic drain and repair faulty components or wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks will not operate or they may only operate intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300+ per door

**Exterior**

*   **Side Mirror Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration of the side mirrors at highway speeds, making it difficult to see clearly.
    *   Solution: Tightening of the mirror mounting bolts or replacement of the mirror assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$300+

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blower motor not working on any or all speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor or blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$400

**Summary**

The 2014 GMC Savana 4500, while valued for its utility, has some known reliability issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the 6.0L Vortec and fuel injector issues in the 6.6L Duramax, can be costly to address. Suspension and electrical problems also contribute to potential repair expenses. Overall, owners should be prepared for moderate to potentially high repair costs, especially when dealing with engine or transmission-related problems.
