Common dislikes include its dated interior, relatively poor fuel economy, and handling compared to more modern vans. The 2016 Savana 4500 offered a few engine options. The most common is the 6.0L Vortec V8, producing 342 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque. Also available was a 6.6L Duramax diesel engine, producing 260 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 (L96)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Possible causes range from worn valve stem seals to piston ring issues. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source. Depending on the diagnosis, repair may involve replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or even a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$5000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idle, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light are indicators of a failing fuel injector.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves testing each injector individually. Replacing the faulty injector is the standard fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (per injector, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Diesel (LGH)**

* **Glow Plug Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather, excessive white smoke at startup, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Diagnosis involves testing the glow plugs and glow plug control module. Replacement of faulty glow plugs and/or the control module is the typical repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the number of glow plugs replaced and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L90 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, and general rough operation of the transmission.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic scan can reveal trouble codes. Fluid flush, valve body replacement, or complete transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (for fluid flush) - $4000+ (for rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially under load, uneven ride height, and potential snapping noises from the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the leaf springs for cracks or excessive sag. Replacement of the leaf spring pack is the recommended repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (per side, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front End Noise/Wandering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, excessive play in the steering wheel, and difficulty keeping the vehicle tracking straight.
    *   Solution: Inspection of ball joints, tie rod ends, and control arm bushings. Replacement of worn components. An alignment is crucial after these repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the number of parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently, leading to difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: A parasitic draw test can identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source and complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illumination on the dashboard, loss of ABS functionality, and potential issues with the stability control system.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify the faulty ABS sensor. Replacement of the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per sensor, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Side Door Latch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the side doors, latch sticking, and potential inability to secure the doors properly.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the latch mechanism. If the latch is damaged, replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on whether cleaning/lube is sufficient or replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents, or the blower only works on certain speeds.
