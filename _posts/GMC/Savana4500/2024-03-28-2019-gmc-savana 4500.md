Despite its overall reliability, the 2019 GMC Savana 4500 has been reported to have some specific issues.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**
* **Intake manifold failure:** This issue occurs due to a faulty intake manifold gasket, which can leak coolant and cause overheating. Symptoms include loss of coolant, engine overheating, and poor performance. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+

**6.0L V8**

* **Valve lifter failure:** This issue involves the premature failure of the valve lifters, which can cause a loss of power, rough engine operation, and increased noise. The solution is to replace the failed valve lifters. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $800+
* **Timing chain failure:** The timing chain can prematurely stretch or break, leading to catastrophic engine failure. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, reduced power, and the engine stalling. The solution is to replace the timing chain and related components. Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $3,500+

**6.6L V8**

* **Fuel injector failure:** The fuel injectors can fail, causing the engine to run rough, have difficulty starting, and experience a loss of power. The solution is to replace the failed fuel injectors. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+ per injector
* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail, resulting in a loss of power, increased fuel consumption, and a whistling or whining noise from the engine. The solution is to replace the turbocharger. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

**Transmission**

**6-speed automatic transmission**

* **Shift solenoid issues:** The shift solenoids can malfunction, causing the transmission to shift erratically or not shift at all. Symptoms include slipping gears, delayed shifts, and harsh shifts. The solution is to replace the failed shift solenoids. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $700+

**8-speed automatic transmission**

* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering, loss of power, and difficulty shifting gears. The solution is to replace the torque converter. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
* **Valve body failure:** The valve body can malfunction, causing the transmission to behave erratically. Symptoms include slipping gears, delayed shifts, and the transmission going into limp mode. The solution is to replace the valve body. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+

**10-speed automatic transmission**

* **No widespread issues reported.**
