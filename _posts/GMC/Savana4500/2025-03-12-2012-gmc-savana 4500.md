Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2012 GMC Savana 4500, categorized and formatted as requested. The 2012 GMC Savana 4500 is a heavy-duty full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes like cargo hauling and passenger transport. Engine options for the 2012 Savana 4500 include a 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 324 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 producing 260 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Savana owners often appreciate its robust capabilities, spacious interior, and ease of customization. However, common dislikes include its utilitarian interior, relatively poor fuel economy, and potential for higher maintenance costs due to its heavy-duty nature.

**Engine**
