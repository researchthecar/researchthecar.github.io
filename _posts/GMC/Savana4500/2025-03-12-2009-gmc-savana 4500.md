The 2009 GMC Savana 4500 is a full-size van known for its robust capabilities and utility, often used for commercial purposes. Common engine options for this model year include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (rated at 300 hp and 360 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (rated at 250 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque). There were also other gasoline engine options such as the 4.8L and 5.3L V8 options. A common complaint amongst owners is the size, making the van hard to park, as well as the fuel economy. Owners tend to like the cargo capacity and towing capabilities.

**Summary:**

The 2009 GMC Savana 4500 presents several potential issues related to its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, exterior, and interior. Engine problems, such as oil consumption in the 6.0L Vortec V8 and DPF issues in the 6.6L Duramax Diesel, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly slipping or erratic shifting in the 4L80E and torque converter problems in the Allison 1000, can also be expensive. Suspension problems, electrical faults, rust, and interior issues, like HVAC blower motor failure, can add to the overall cost of ownership. While the severity and cost of these issues can vary, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
