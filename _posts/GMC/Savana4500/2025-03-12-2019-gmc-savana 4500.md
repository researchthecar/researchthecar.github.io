The 2019 GMC Savana 4500 is a full-size commercial van known for its ruggedness and versatility. It is popular for conversions into shuttle buses, ambulances, and other specialized vehicles. While lauded for its payload capacity and towing capability, common criticisms revolve around its outdated design, fuel economy, and ride quality. The 2019 Savana 4500 offered two engine options: a 6.0L V8 engine that produces 341 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel engine that produces 181 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The 6.0L V8 engine is paired with a Hydra-Matic 6L90 six-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.8L Duramax engine is paired with a Hydra-Matic 6L50 six-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.0L V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: The solution can vary, ranging from replacing valve seals or piston rings to replacing the entire engine in severe cases. A compression test can help diagnose the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, illuminated check engine light (typically P0420 code), and a sulfur smell from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

* **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine lights related to the DEF system, including codes such as P20EE (SCR NOx Catalyst Efficiency Below Threshold) and P249D (Closed Loop Reductant Injection Control At Limit - Flow Too High). Can also include warnings about poor DEF fluid quality or low DEF fluid levels despite a full tank.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and potential replacement of the DEF injector, DEF pump, NOx sensors, or the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst. A software update may also be required to address calibration issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+, depending on the component needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced fuel economy, and potential black smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Individual injector testing and replacement of faulty injectors. Cleaning the fuel system and replacing the fuel filter is recommended as a preventative measure.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+, depending on the number of injectors needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Hydra-Matic 6L90 (Paired with 6.0L V8)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt and jarring shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, and sometimes between 2nd and 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis includes checking the transmission fluid level and condition, inspecting the valve body for wear or damage, and potentially replacing the valve body or the entire transmission. A software update may sometimes resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3,500+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Hydra-Matic 6L50 (Paired with 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A vibrating or shuddering sensation, particularly at lower speeds or during light acceleration. Often felt around 30-45 mph.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with a fluid specifically designed to address torque converter shudder is the first step. In more severe cases, torque converter replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $1,200+ (torque converter replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially under load. Reduced ride height, compromised handling, and potential cracking of the leaf springs themselves.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf spring assembly. Upgrading to heavy-duty leaf springs is recommended for vehicles frequently used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200 per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery repeatedly dying, especially after short periods of inactivity. Difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories (like installed lights), faulty door switches, or a malfunctioning body control module (BCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminated on the dashboard, loss of ABS functionality, and potentially inaccurate speedometer readings.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty ABS sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult to open or close the sliding side door, sticking, binding, or requiring excessive force to operate.
    * Solution: Inspection and lubrication of the door tracks, rollers, and hinges. Replacement of worn or damaged rollers or cables. Adjustment of the door alignment.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blower motor not working, intermittent operation, or only working on certain speed settings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor or the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Belt Retractor Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Seat belt failing to retract properly, retracting slowly, or not retracting at all.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty seat belt retractor mechanism.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per seat belt.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2019 GMC Savana 4500, while a capable work van, can be prone to several issues. Oil consumption, catalytic converter failure, DEF system issues and fuel injector problems are among the engine-related concerns, while the transmissions may experience harsh shifting or torque converter shudder. Suspension issues like leaf spring sagging are also common. Electrical gremlins such as battery drains and ABS sensor failures can also arise. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others like engine or transmission replacements can be very costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase.
