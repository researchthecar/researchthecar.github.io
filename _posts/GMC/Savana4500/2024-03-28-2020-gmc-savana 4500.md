## 2020 GMC Savana 4500

The 2020 GMC Savana 4500 is a full-size van offered with three engine options: a 4.3L V6, a 6.0L V8, and a 6.6L Duramax V8 diesel. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic and a 10-speed automatic. The Savana 4500 is praised for its spacious cargo area, powerful engines, and comfortable ride. However, it is criticized for its outdated interior, poor fuel economy, and limited safety features.

### Engine

**4.3L V6**

* **Faulty Engine Control Module:** The ECM may fail, causing the engine to stall or run rough. Replacing the ECM fixes the issue. $200-$400+

**6.0L V8**

* **Piston Ring Failure:** The piston rings may fail, leading to excessive oil consumption and poor engine performance. Overhauling the engine is the solution. $3,000-$5,000+

**6.6L Duramax V8 Diesel**

* **Fuel Injector Failure:** The fuel injectors may clog or fail, causing engine performance issues. Replacing the fuel injectors resolves the problem. $300-$600+

### Transmission

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Fluid Leak:** The transmission may develop a leak, which can damage the transmission if not addressed promptly. Replacing the seals or gaskets stops the leak. $100-$400+

**10-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift Shudder:** The transmission may shudder during gear shifts, especially when cold. Updating the transmission software typically resolves this issue. No Cost

### Suspension

* **Worn Shocks and Struts:** Over time, the shocks and struts may wear out, causing a rough ride and poor handling. Replacing worn shocks or struts improves ride quality. $200-$500+

* **Broken Leaf Spring:** If overloaded, the leaf springs may break, affecting vehicle stability and ride height. Replacing the leaf springs resolves the issue. $500-$1,000+

### Electrical

* **Faulty Battery:** The battery may fail prematurely, causing electrical problems or difficulty starting the vehicle. Replacing the battery solves the problem. $100-$200+

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may malfunction, leading to electrical system issues. Replacing the alternator is the solution. $300-$600+

### Exterior

* **Rust on Door Frames:** The metal door frames may rust over time, affecting the appearance of the vehicle. Replacing the door frames is the solution. $500-$1,000+

* **Tailgate Corrosion:** The tailgate may corrode due to exposure to the elements. Regular cleaning and waxing can help prevent corrosion. No Fix

### Interior

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may fail to function properly, causing uncomfortable cabin temperatures. Replacing the climate control module or sensors fixes the issue. $200-$500+

* **Cruise Control Failure:** The cruise control may cease to function due to a faulty switch or module. Replacing the affected component resolves the problem. $100-$400+

### Summary

The 2020 GMC Savana 4500 is a reliable and capable van but is not without its issues. While some issues, such as engine control module failure or transmission fluid leaks, can be costly, many others are relatively inexpensive to fix. Overall, the severity and cost of the issues are not excessive for a vehicle in this class.
