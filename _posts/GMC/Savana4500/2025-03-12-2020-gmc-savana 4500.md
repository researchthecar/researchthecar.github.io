Okay, here's a breakdown of the common issues reported for the 2020 GMC Savana 4500, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2020 GMC Savana 4500 is a heavy-duty full-size van designed for commercial use. It is offered with either a 6.0L V8 engine, which produced 341 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.8L Duramax Diesel engine, which produced 181 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Savana's robust build, payload capacity, and utilitarian design. However, common dislikes include its dated interior, fuel economy, and relatively basic technology offerings.

**Engine**

**6.0L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, check engine light (CEL) illuminated with codes related to cylinder deactivation (e.g., P0300, P0302, P0305). Can lead to engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of failed lifters, often requires removal of the cylinder head. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system entirely during the repair to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of damage and AFM delete.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, potentially due to piston ring issues or valve seal leaks. Owners report needing to add oil frequently between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the source of oil consumption. May involve replacing piston rings, valve seals, or, in severe cases, the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $6,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine power, DEF system malfunction messages. Potential issues with DEF injector, DEF pump, or NOx sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific component failure. Replacement of faulty DEF system components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, black smoke from exhaust, reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm injector failure. Replacement of faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the number of injectors needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds or during light acceleration, particularly when the transmission is in lock-up.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Some owners have found success with a transmission fluid flush and updated fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifts, delayed engagement when shifting between gears (especially Park to Drive or Reverse), or transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild) depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower than normal, especially in the rear. Reduced load-carrying capacity. Visible cracks in the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends. Front end alignment is recommended after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a short period of time, requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic draw. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing body control module (BCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (ABS, Wheel Speed)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminated, traction control issues, speedometer malfunction. Diagnostic trouble codes indicating a specific sensor failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Track Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sliding door difficult to open or close, sticking, or making grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubrication of the door tracks. Replacement of worn rollers or the entire track assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1,000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2020 GMC Savana 4500, while a capable work van, exhibits several common issues. The 6.0L V8 engine is prone to AFM lifter failure and oil consumption, which can be expensive to repair. The 2.8L Duramax Diesel has issues with its DEF System and Fuel Injectors. Both engine options suffer from issues with the 6-speed transmission. Other areas of concern include suspension component wear, electrical issues, and sliding door problems. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and budget accordingly for repairs, or seek out a vehicle with a well-documented maintenance history. The severity of the issues ranges from relatively minor to potentially catastrophic engine or transmission failures, with repair costs varying widely.
