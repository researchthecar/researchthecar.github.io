The 2017 GMC Savana 4500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, such as cargo transport, passenger transport (converted buses), and utility work. It's known for its robust build, large cargo capacity, and relatively simple, easy-to-maintain design. However, it's often criticized for its dated interior, relatively poor fuel economy compared to more modern vans, and somewhat agricultural driving experience. The 2017 model year Savana 4500 offered several engine options. The most common and well-documented is the 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 342 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include the 4.3L V6 and a 2.8L Duramax diesel. The primary transmission paired with the 6.0L V8 is the 6L90 six-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, check engine light illuminated. Often caused by AFM lifters collapsing, leading to damage to the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replacement of failed lifters, often requiring camshaft replacement as well. AFM delete kits are sometimes used to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption between oil changes, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels, potential piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.3L V6**

No Issues Found

**2.8L Duramax Diesel**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6L90 Six-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear shifts, particularly at low speeds. Delayed engagement, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Thoroughly flush the transmission cooler lines to remove debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abnormally hard or delayed gear changes, sometimes accompanied by loud clunking noises. This can be caused by worn valve body components or internal transmission damage.
    * Solution: Diagnosis can involve scanning for diagnostic trouble codes, performing a transmission fluid level and condition inspection, and potentially a valve body inspection or replacement. In severe cases, the entire transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load-carrying capacity, poor ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaf springs. Upgraded springs can be installed for increased load capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per joint/end.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems such as malfunctioning lights, power windows, or door locks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement or reprogramming of the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corroded or damaged wiring harnesses, particularly in areas exposed to the elements.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of damaged wiring harnesses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Roller Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulties opening or closing the sliding side door, grinding noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sliding door rollers and associated hardware.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per roller assembly.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Frame Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks in the seat frame, usually on the driver's seat, causing discomfort.
    *   Solution: Welding repairs or seat frame replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Summary**

The 2017 GMC Savana 4500, while a workhorse known for its utility, can experience several common issues. The most serious and costly problems are related to the 6.0L Vortec V8 engine, specifically AFM lifter failure and oil consumption. Transmission problems, such as torque converter failure, can also be expensive to repair. Suspension and electrical issues, while less severe, can still contribute to maintenance costs. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, including a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
