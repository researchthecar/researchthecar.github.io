Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft torque), the 8.1L Vortec V8 (340 hp, 455 lb-ft torque), and the 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (300 hp, 520 lb-ft torque). Transmission options primarily included the 4L80E four-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the truck's robust build and ability to handle demanding tasks. Common dislikes include the truck's age-related maintenance needs and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, coolant leaks (externally), and potential for overheating. The engine may run rough, and there may be a noticeable loss of coolant without an obvious external leak (coolant could be entering the combustion chamber).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous or no oil pressure readings on the instrument cluster gauge. Can sometimes trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leaks, ticking noises (especially when cold), reduced fuel economy, and potential for exhaust fumes entering the cabin.
    *   Solution: Removal of broken bolts and installation of new exhaust manifold bolts and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ (depending on the number of broken bolts and accessibility)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, poor acceleration, reduced fuel economy, and check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (LB7)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: White smoke from exhaust, rough idling, poor fuel economy, and potential for excessive crankcase oil dilution with diesel fuel. This is a VERY common issue with the LB7 Duramax.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed fuel injectors. The entire set is often replaced to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+ (due to the complexity of the Duramax injection system and the number of injectors)
    *   Recalls: Recall Number: 04039, NHTSA Recall Number: 04V534000. This recall addressed potential fuel leakage from damaged fuel lines, but not the injector failure itself.

*   **Glow Plug Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather, white smoke on startup, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty glow plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the number of glow plugs needing replacement and ease of access).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L80E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts between gears, slipping during acceleration, and general erratic behavior. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the root cause. This may involve a transmission fluid flush, valve body repair/replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, and unusual noises emanating from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Sagging Leaf Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, especially in the rear, poor handling, and bottoming out when carrying loads.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ (for both rear leaf springs, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per side, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic or non-functioning gauges (speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge), dim or non-functional backlighting.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster. This often involves resoldering connections or replacing stepper motors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the complexity of the repair or if a replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Grounding Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, accessories not working properly, and difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and tightening all grounding points throughout the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the severity and extent of the problem)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels/Cab Corners**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation and eventual perforation of the rocker panels and cab corners. This is a common problem in areas with road salt.

**Summary**

The 2002 GMC C3500HD, while a capable truck, exhibits several common issues related to its age and heavy-duty usage. Engine problems, particularly fuel injector failures in the Duramax diesel and intake manifold gasket leaks in the 6.0L Vortec, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, sagging suspension, and electrical gremlins are also potential concerns. Rust is a significant issue in certain climates. Overall, while these trucks can be affordable, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance needs and factor them into their purchasing decision. Severity ranges from minor annoyances to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the issue.
