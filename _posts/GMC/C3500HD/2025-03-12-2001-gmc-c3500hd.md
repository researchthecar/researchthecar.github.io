The 2001 GMC C3500HD is a heavy-duty work truck appreciated for its robust capabilities and simple, reliable design. Engine options included the 5.7L Vortec V8 (255 hp, 330 lb-ft of torque), the 7.4L Vortec V8 (290 hp, 410 lb-ft of torque) and the legendary 6.6L Duramax LB7 Diesel V8 (300 hp, 520 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were typically either a 4L80E four-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission (NV4500). Owners often praise the truck's durability and towing capacity, but some common complaints include rust issues, the age of the vehicle resulting in general wear and tear, and some specific issues related to the Duramax diesel engine.

**Summary**

The 2001 GMC C3500HD is a capable and dependable truck, but its age means that certain issues are more common. The most significant and costly problems often revolve around the Duramax LB7 engine, particularly fuel injector failure. Rust is a major concern, especially in colder climates. Other issues, such as suspension wear and electrical problems, are typical for a vehicle of this age. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the truck for rust, test drive it thoroughly, and have a mechanic inspect the engine, transmission, and suspension before purchase. Repair costs can range from relatively minor fixes to major overhauls, so budget accordingly.
