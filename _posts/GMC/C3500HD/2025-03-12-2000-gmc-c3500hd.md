The 2000 GMC C3500HD is a heavy-duty work truck known for its robust capabilities and reliability, however, like any vehicle of its age, it can be susceptible to certain issues. This generation of the C3500HD was offered with a variety of engine options, including the 5.7L Vortec V8 (255 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque), the 7.4L Vortec V8 (290 hp and 410 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.5L Turbo Diesel V8 (215 hp and 440 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included the 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission and a five-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the truck's towing capacity, ruggedness, and straightforward design. However, common complaints revolve around fuel economy (particularly with the larger gasoline engines), ride quality, and the age-related wear and tear on components.

Engine problems range from relatively minor fixes like intake manifold gaskets to more costly repairs like PMD relocation on the 6.5L diesel or injector replacement on the 5.7L gas engine. Transmission issues can be significant, potentially requiring a full rebuild or replacement. Suspension and electrical problems are common and can affect the truck's handling and functionality. Exterior rust is a major concern, especially in certain climates. Interior issues, while often cosmetic, can detract from the overall driving experience.
