**Engine**

**5.7L V8**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak. Symptoms include a drop in coolant level, an increase in oil consumption, and a rough idle. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $800+.
* **Knock sensor failure:** The knock sensor can fail, causing the engine to run poorly and lose power. Symptoms include a knocking noise, a loss of power, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the knock sensor. The estimated cost to fix is $200 - $400+.
* **Camshaft position sensor failure:** The camshaft position sensor can fail, causing the engine to run erratically and lose power. Symptoms include a rough idle, a loss of power, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the camshaft position sensor. The estimated cost to fix is $200 - $400+.

**6.2L V8**

* **Valve cover gasket failure:** The valve cover gasket can fail, causing oil to leak. Symptoms include a drop in oil level, an oil leak, and a burning oil smell. The solution is to replace the valve cover gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $200 - $400+.
* **Exhaust manifold gasket failure:** The exhaust manifold gasket can fail, causing exhaust gases to leak. Symptoms include a loud exhaust noise, a loss of power, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the exhaust manifold gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $300 - $500+.
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak. Symptoms include a drop in coolant level, an increase in oil consumption, and a rough idle. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $800+.

**7.4L V8**

* **Cylinder head gasket failure:** The cylinder head gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak. Symptoms include a drop in coolant level, an increase in oil consumption, and a white smoke from the exhaust. The solution is to replace the cylinder head gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $1,000 - $1,500+.
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak. Symptoms include a drop in coolant level, an increase in oil consumption, and a rough idle. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $800+.
* **Exhaust manifold gasket failure:** The exhaust manifold gasket can fail, causing exhaust gases to leak. Symptoms include a loud exhaust noise, a loss of power, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the exhaust manifold gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $300 - $500+.

**6.5L Turbocharged Diesel V8**

* **Injection pump failure:** The injection pump can fail, causing the engine to lose power. Symptoms include a loss of power, a black smoke from the exhaust, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the injection pump. The estimated cost to fix is $1,000 - $1,500+.
* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail, causing the engine to lose power. Symptoms include a loss of power, a blue smoke from the exhaust, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the turbocharger. The estimated cost to fix is $1,000 - $1,500+.
* **Fuel injector failure:** The fuel injector can fail, causing the engine to run poorly. Symptoms include a rough idle, a loss of power, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the fuel injector. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $800+.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch can fail, causing the transmission to slip or not engage. Symptoms include a slipping clutch, a grinding noise when shifting, and a difficulty shifting gears. The solution is to replace the clutch. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $800+.
* **Transmission mount failure:** The transmission mount can fail, causing the transmission to vibrate. Symptoms include a vibration when shifting gears, a noise when shifting gears, and a difficulty shifting gears. The solution is to replace the transmission mount. The estimated cost to fix is $200 - $400+.

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Synchronizer failure:** The synchronizer can fail, causing difficulty shifting gears. Symptoms include a grinding noise when shifting gears, a difficulty shifting gears, and a popping out of gear. The solution is to replace the synchronizer. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $800+.
* **Transmission fluid leak:** The transmission fluid leak can occur, causing the transmission to slip or not engage. Symptoms include a drop in transmission fluid level, a leak under the vehicle, and a difficulty shifting gears. The solution is to replace the transmission fluid leak. The estimated cost to fix is $200 - $400+.
