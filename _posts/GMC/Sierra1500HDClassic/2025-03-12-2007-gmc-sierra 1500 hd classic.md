**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec Max V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+

*   **Knocking Engine Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud knocking or tapping noise, especially at idle or low RPMs. Often related to worn or damaged connecting rod bearings.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild or replacement. Replacing connecting rod bearings may provide a temporary solution, but engine damage is likely present.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
