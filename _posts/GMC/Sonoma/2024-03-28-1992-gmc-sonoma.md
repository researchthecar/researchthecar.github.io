**Introduction:**

The 1992 GMC Sonoma is a compact pickup truck offered in two trim levels: base and SLS. The base trim comes with a 2.5L four-cylinder engine producing 110 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. The SLS trim adds a 4.3L V6 engine that generates 160 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a standard five-speed manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic transmission. Despite its compact size, the Sonoma offers a surprisingly spacious interior and a comfortable ride. However, it is known to have some issues, particularly with its V6 engine and automatic transmission.
