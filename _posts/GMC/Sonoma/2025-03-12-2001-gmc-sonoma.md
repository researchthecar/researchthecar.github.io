The 2001 GMC Sonoma is a compact pickup truck known for its maneuverability and affordability. It was offered with a few different engine options. The base engine was a 2.2L Inline-4 producing approximately 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. Other available engine options include a 4.3L V6 engine. Owners often appreciate the Sonoma for its smaller size, making it easier to park and drive in urban environments, and its relative simplicity, which can make it easier to maintain. Some common complaints include the truck's somewhat dated interior, smaller cabin size compared to full-size trucks, and some reliability concerns as the vehicle ages.

**Summary**

The 2001 GMC Sonoma, while a capable compact truck, is showing its age, and owners may encounter several common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 4.3L V6's fuel injector assembly and the 2.2L's intake manifold gaskets, can be costly to repair. The 4L60E transmission is also a known weak point, with potential for slipping and torque converter failures. Suspension components like ball joints and steering linkage are prone to wear. Electrical issues like headlight switch and fuel pump relay failures are also common. Interior problems include dashboard cracking and blend door actuator malfunctions. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive (relays, door handles), others, like transmission rebuilds or engine repairs, can be quite costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential expenses and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
