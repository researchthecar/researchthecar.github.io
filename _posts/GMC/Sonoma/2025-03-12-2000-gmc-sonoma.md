The 2000 GMC Sonoma is a compact pickup truck known for its affordability, maneuverability, and decent fuel economy. Available engine options include a 2.2L inline-4, a 4.3L V6. The 2.2L inline-4 produces around 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. The 4.3L V6 produces 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Many owners appreciate the Sonoma's compact size, making it easy to park and navigate in urban environments. Others dislike the relatively small cabin and limited bed space, particularly for those who need to haul larger items regularly. Common complaints include issues stemming from the truck's age, such as worn suspension components and electrical problems.
