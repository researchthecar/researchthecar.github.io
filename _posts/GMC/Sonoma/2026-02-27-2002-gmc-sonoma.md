### Summary Verdict
The 2002 GMC Sonoma, while generally a capable compact truck, exhibits common issues typical for its age and segment. The 2.2L and 4.3L engines can experience intake manifold gasket leaks and oil cooler line issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4L60-E, may develop slipping or torque converter problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also noted for wear. Electrical issues such as alternator and window regulator failures are not uncommon. Exterior rust, especially on the frame, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor and door lock actuators are also areas to monitor. Despite these potential problems, many Sonomas remain on the road with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
