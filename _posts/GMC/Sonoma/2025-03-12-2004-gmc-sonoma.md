The 2004 GMC Sonoma is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and maneuverability, appealing to those seeking a smaller, more fuel-efficient alternative to full-size trucks. However, being an older vehicle, it's prone to certain common issues due to age and wear. Engine options for the 2004 Sonoma included a 2.2L Inline-4, producing around 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.3L V6, generating approximately 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Sonoma's compact size for city driving and its affordability. However, common complaints include the limited rear seat space in extended cab models and the dated interior design.

**Summary:**

The 2004 GMC Sonoma, while generally reliable, is subject to common issues associated with age. Engine problems, such as intake manifold gasket leaks (2.2L) and fuel injector failure (4.3L), can lead to rough running and poor fuel economy. Transmission issues, particularly slipping in the 4L60E automatic, are also reported. Suspension wear, including ball joints and leaf springs, contributes to handling and ride quality concerns. Electrical issues, such as blower motor resistor failures, and rust are other common problems. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, with engine and transmission repairs potentially being the most expensive, while electrical and suspension fixes are generally more affordable. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for maintaining the Sonoma's reliability and safety.
