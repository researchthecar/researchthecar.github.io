The 2003 GMC Sonoma is generally a reliable vehicle, but it is not immune to potential issues. Engine and transmission problems can be the most costly to fix, ranging from $1,200 to $3,500 or more. While many issues can be resolved for under $1,000, ongoing concerns such as rust and electrical issues can require ongoing maintenance and repair costs that may impact the overall value of the vehicle.
