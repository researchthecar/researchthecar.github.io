The 2002 GMC Sonoma is a compact pickup truck known for its affordability and practicality. Engine options included a 2.2L Inline-4 producing around 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, a 4.3L V6 producing around 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Sonoma's compact size for maneuverability and fuel efficiency (especially with the 4-cylinder), but some criticize its relatively basic interior and limited towing capacity compared to larger trucks. Common complaints revolve around age-related issues like rust, failing sensors, and general wear and tear.
