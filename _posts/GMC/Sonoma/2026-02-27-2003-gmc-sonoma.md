### Summary Verdict
The 2003 GMC Sonoma is a generally reliable compact truck, particularly with its V6 engine options. Common issues tend to revolve around the intake manifold gaskets, particularly on the 4.3L V6, and potential leaks from the rear main seal on the 2.2L. Automatic transmission problems like slipping and torque converter issues are not uncommon as the vehicle ages. Suspension components such as ball joints and leaf springs may require attention. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM, can manifest as various system malfunctions. Exterior rust, especially in common areas, and interior wear on upholstery and HVAC components are also points to consider. Despite these potential issues, many Sonomas continue to serve their owners well with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
