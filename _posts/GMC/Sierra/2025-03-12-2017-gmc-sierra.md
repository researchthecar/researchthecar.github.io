The 2017 GMC Sierra is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, capable performance, and available features. It comes in a variety of configurations, including different cab styles, bed lengths, and trim levels. Engine options include a 4.3L V6, a 5.3L V8, and a 6.2L V8. The 4.3L V6 produces 285 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque. The 5.3L V8 generates 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. The 6.2L V8 cranks out 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Most models are equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while some higher trim levels with the 5.3L and 6.2L engines feature an 8-speed automatic. Some owners appreciate the Sierra's smooth ride and quiet cabin, while others have reported issues with its infotainment system and reliability.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**5.3L V8 (6-Speed Transmission)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illumination (typically with codes P0300, P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304, P0305, P0306, P0307, or P0308). Often caused by a failed AFM lifter collapsing and damaging the camshaft lobe.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters, camshaft, and potentially the VLOM (Valve Lifter Oil Manifold). AFM delete kits are also a common solution, replacing the AFM components with standard non-AFM parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8 (8-Speed Transmission - 8L90)**

*   **"Chevy Shake" or "Torque Converter Shudder"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, often described as a "rumble strip" feel, felt at highway speeds (typically between 40-80 mph) and during light acceleration. Often noticed when the transmission is in a higher gear and the torque converter is locked. Can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: A revised transmission fluid has been developed by GM (Mobil Delvac 1 ESP). In some cases, a complete torque converter replacement is necessary, as well as a transmission flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$700+ for fluid change, $1,500 - $3,000+ for torque converter replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illumination (typically with codes P0300, P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304, P0305, P0306, P0307, or P0308). Often caused by a failed AFM lifter collapsing and damaging the camshaft lobe.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters, camshaft, and potentially the VLOM (Valve Lifter Oil Manifold). AFM delete kits are also a common solution, replacing the AFM components with standard non-AFM parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable decrease in oil level between oil changes, often requiring the owner to add oil between service intervals. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, piston ring replacement is necessary to resolve the issue. Valve seals are another possible source of oil consumption. A catch can can also reduce the amount of oil entering the intake.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8 (8-Speed Transmission - 8L90)**

*   **"Chevy Shake" or "Torque Converter Shudder"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, often described as a "rumble strip" feel, felt at highway speeds (typically between 40-80 mph) and during light acceleration.

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, hesitation when accelerating, and/or difficulty finding the correct gear.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters not working or only partially working.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the seat heater element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 GMC Sierra, while generally a reliable truck, has a few notable issues. The most significant issues relate to the 5.3L and 6.2L V8 engines with the 8-speed transmission, particularly the torque converter shudder and AFM lifter failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also common. While the V6 and 6-speed transmission configurations appear more reliable, potential buyers should be aware of the potential problems, especially with trucks equipped with the 8-speed transmission. The severity of these issues ranges from annoying (infotainment glitches) to potentially catastrophic (engine failure), with repair costs varying accordingly.
