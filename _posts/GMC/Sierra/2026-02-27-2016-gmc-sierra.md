### Summary Verdict
The 2016 GMC Sierra 1500 is a generally dependable truck, particularly the V8 engines and automatic transmissions, when properly maintained. The most frequently cited technical concerns revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the EcoTec3 engines, which can lead to lifter and oil consumption issues. Transmission issues, while not pervasive, can include torque converter shudder or solenoid problems. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and intermittent battery drain, are also noted. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and ensure regular maintenance, especially oil changes, to mitigate risks associated with AFM. Addressing early symptoms promptly can prevent more costly repairs.
