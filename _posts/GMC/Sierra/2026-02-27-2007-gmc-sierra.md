### Summary Verdict
The 2007 GMC Sierra is a capable truck with a generally solid reputation, particularly the V8 engine options. However, potential buyers and owners should be aware of common issues such as Active Fuel Management (AFM) problems in the 5.3L V8, intake manifold gasket leaks across multiple engines, and potential wear on suspension components like ball joints. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, can also arise. While rust can be a concern on older models, most interior and exterior issues are manageable. Addressing these potential problems proactively can ensure a reliable ownership experience.
