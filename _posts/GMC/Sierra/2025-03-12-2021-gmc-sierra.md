The 2021 GMC Sierra 1500 is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, upscale interior options, and strong towing capabilities. Engine choices include a 2.7L turbocharged four-cylinder (310 hp, 348 lb-ft torque), a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft torque), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft torque), and a 3.0L Duramax turbodiesel (277 hp, 460 lb-ft torque). Transmission options vary depending on the engine, including 6-speed, 8-speed, and 10-speed automatics. Owners often praise the Sierra for its refined cabin and advanced technology, but some common complaints revolve around electrical glitches, transmission performance (particularly with the 8-speed), and some build quality issues.

**Summary**

The 2021 GMC Sierra 1500 presents a mix of potential issues ranging from moderate to severe. Engine problems like AFM/DFM lifter failure and oil consumption in the V8 engines can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues such as harsh shifting are also relatively common, especially in the 8-speed and 10-speed automatic transmissions. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and backup camera can be annoying but are generally less expensive to fix. Exterior problems like bed rail corrosion can occur, particularly in certain climates. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and consider extended warranties or thorough pre-purchase inspections to mitigate potential repair costs.
