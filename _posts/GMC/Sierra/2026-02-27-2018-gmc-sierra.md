### Summary Verdict
The 2018 GMC Sierra 1500 demonstrates solid overall reliability, particularly with its V6 engine option. The V8 engines, while powerful, have some documented concerns related to the Active Fuel Management system, specifically lifter wear and oil consumption, which can lead to significant repair costs. The 8-speed automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit shifting issues. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted but generally manageable. Exterior and interior components are largely free of widespread problems. Owners should be aware of the potential AFM-related issues with the V8 engines and budget accordingly for potential repairs.
