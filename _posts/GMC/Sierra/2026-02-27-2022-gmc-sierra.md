### Summary Verdict
The 2022 GMC Sierra 1500 demonstrates a good overall reliability record, with most owners experiencing no significant issues beyond routine maintenance. The most frequently cited concerns, though not epidemic, tend to revolve around the 2.7L Turbo engine's performance characteristics and potential oil consumption, as well as isolated reports of issues with the Active Fuel Management system in the 5.3L V8. Transmission performance is generally solid, with the 8-speed automatic occasionally noted for shifting anomalies. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are present but not widespread. The diesel engine's DPF system requires attention as expected. For the most part, the Sierra is a dependable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific component vulnerabilities.
