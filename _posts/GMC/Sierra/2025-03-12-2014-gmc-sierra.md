Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2014 GMC Sierra, organized by category and engine/transmission option.

The 2014 GMC Sierra is a full-size pickup truck that offers a blend of capability and comfort. It was a popular choice for its towing capacity, spacious cabin, and available technology. Engine options included a 4.3L V6 (285 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Sierra's styling, quiet cabin, and smooth ride, but some common complaints include issues with the automatic transmission, excessive oil consumption in some engines, and certain electrical glitches.

**Summary**

The 2014 GMC Sierra, while generally a reliable truck, has several common issues to be aware of. The most serious and potentially costly problems revolve around the 5.3L and 6.2L V8 engines, particularly AFM lifter failure and excessive oil consumption. Transmission issues, while less severe, can also be a significant expense. Electrical gremlins like radio and backup camera failures are also fairly common. Potential buyers should have these areas inspected before purchasing a used 2014 Sierra.
