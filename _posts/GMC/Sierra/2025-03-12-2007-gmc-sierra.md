The 2007 GMC Sierra 1500 is a full-size pickup truck known for its reliability and capability, but like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. Engine options for the 2007 Sierra included a 4.3L V6 (195 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 4.8L V8 (295 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (315 hp, 338 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (367 hp, 375 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options consisted primarily of a 4-speed automatic, with the 6.0L V8 sometimes paired with a heavy-duty 4-speed or a 6-speed automatic in later production models. Owners often praised the Sierra for its comfortable ride, strong towing capacity, and classic styling. However, common complaints include issues with the vehicle's electrical system, specifically the gauge cluster, as well as problems with the automatic transmission, particularly in higher mileage examples.

**Summary**

The 2007 GMC Sierra 1500 is generally a reliable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the engine (AFM lifter failure, oil consumption), transmission (harsh shifting), electrical system (gauge cluster failure), and rust. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the severity of the problem, but some issues like AFM lifter failure or transmission rebuilds can be quite expensive. Being proactive with maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly can help prevent more significant problems down the road. The most common complaints tend to be around the gauge cluster failing and AFM lifters failing in the 5.3L engine.
