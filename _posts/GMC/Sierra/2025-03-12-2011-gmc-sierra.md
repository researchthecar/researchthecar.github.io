**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, cylinder misfires, rough idling, and potential damage to catalytic converters. This is often related to the AFM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Disabling the AFM system (using a tuner or aftermarket device) or replacing the AFM lifters with standard lifters. Replacing valve cover with redesigned version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts causing an exhaust leak, ticking noise, and reduced fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replacing the broken bolts, potentially with upgraded aftermarket bolts that are less prone to failure.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800

**Summary:** The 2011 GMC Sierra 1500 can suffer from several common issues. The most significant and potentially costly are related to the AFM system in the 4.8L and 5.3L V8 engines and transmission problems. Electrical issues, such as power window/door lock failures and instrument cluster problems, are also fairly common. While some issues have relatively inexpensive fixes, others, such as engine and transmission repairs, can be quite costly. Addressing these issues promptly can help prevent further damage and extend the vehicle's lifespan.
