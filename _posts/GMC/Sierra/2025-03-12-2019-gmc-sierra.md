The 2019 GMC Sierra 1500 marked the beginning of the fourth generation of this popular pickup truck. It offered a range of engine options including a 2.7L turbocharged inline-4, a 4.3L V6, a 5.3L V8 (with and without Dynamic Fuel Management), and a 6.2L V8. Transmission options primarily included a 6-speed automatic, an 8-speed automatic, and a 10-speed automatic, depending on the engine. The 2.7L turbo inline-4 produced 310 horsepower and 348 lb-ft of torque. The 2019 Sierra was generally praised for its updated styling, comfortable ride, and improved technology features. Some criticisms included the relatively high price point compared to competitors, and some early production quality issues.

**Engine**

**5.3L V8 (with and without Dynamic Fuel Management)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint involves the failure of the AFM/DFM lifters, leading to engine misfires, rough running, and potential damage to the camshaft. Symptoms often include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM/DFM delete kits are also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and repair method)

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled changes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis can involve checking for leaks, performing a compression test, and potentially replacing valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the source of the leak and repairs needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L V8, the 6.2L V8 can also experience AFM/DFM lifter failure, leading to engine misfires, rough running, and potential damage to the camshaft. Symptoms often include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM/DFM delete kits are also an option.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8L90 transmission has been known to exhibit harsh shifting, particularly between lower gears, and hesitation during acceleration. These symptoms are sometimes related to valve body issues or torque converter problems.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush, valve body replacement, or torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+ (depending on the issue and repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported similar issues to the 8-speed, including harsh shifting, particularly between lower gears, and hesitation during acceleration. These symptoms are sometimes related to valve body issues or torque converter problems.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush, valve body replacement, or torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+ (depending on the issue and repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Shaking/Vibration at Highway Speeds**

**Summary**
The 2019 GMC Sierra 1500, while offering improvements in design and technology, has several common issues to be aware of. The engine and transmission, particularly the AFM/DFM systems on the V8 engines and the shifting performance of the 8-speed and 10-speed transmissions, are the most significant sources of complaints and potentially the most expensive to repair. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also relatively common. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes, major repairs related to the engine or transmission can be costly. It is advisable for potential buyers to thoroughly inspect the vehicle, review its maintenance history, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, paying close attention to the engine and transmission performance.
