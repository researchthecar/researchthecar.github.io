**Introduction:**
The 2016 GMC Sierra is a full-size pickup truck available with a range of engine and transmission options. It offers powerful performance, a spacious interior, and advanced technology features. However, like any vehicle, there are some specific issues that owners have reported.

### **Engine**
- **5.3L V8**
   - **Intake Valve Deposits:** Carbon deposits build up on the intake valves, causing reduced engine power and rough idle. Fix: Cleaning the intake valves or replacing them [$500 - $1,000+].
   - **Cylinder Deactivation Failure:** The cylinder deactivation system malfunctions, resulting in a loss of power and increased fuel consumption. Fix: Replacing the cylinder deactivation solenoids [$200 - $500].
- **6.2L V8**
   - **Fuel Injector Failure:** Leaking fuel injectors cause rough idle, misfires, and a strong fuel odor. Fix: Replacing the failed injectors [$300 - $600].
   - **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner fails, allowing the timing chain to become loose. This can cause engine damage. Fix: Replacing the tensioner and timing chain [$1,000 - $2,000+].
- **Duramax 3.0L I6 Diesel**
   - **Emissions System Failure:** The diesel particulate filter (DPF) or exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system malfunctions, leading to reduced performance and increased emissions. Fix: Cleaning or replacing the affected components [$500 - $2,000+].
   - **Fuel Filter Clogging:** The fuel filter becomes clogged prematurely, causing engine hesitation and reduced power. Fix: Replacing the fuel filter [$100 - $200].

### **Transmission**
- **6-Speed Automatic (8L90)**
   - **Shifting Problems:** The transmission hesitates or refuses to shift gears, often due to a faulty solenoid. Fix: Replacing the solenoid or transmission control module [$500 - $1,500].
   - **Torque Converter Shudder:** The torque converter develops a shudder during acceleration or shifting. Fix: Replacing the torque converter [$1,000 - $2,500+].
- **8-Speed Automatic (8L90E)**
   - **Line Pressure Sensor Failure:** The line pressure sensor fails, resulting in incorrect shift timing and potential transmission damage. Fix: Replacing the sensor [$200 - $400].
   - **Valve Body Malfunction:** The valve body malfunctions, leading to shifting problems and transmission overheating. Fix: Rebuilding or replacing the valve body [$500 - $1,200+].

### **Suspension**
- **Coil Spring Failure:** The coil springs break or sag, causing a decrease in ride height and handling performance. Fix: Replacing the springs [$500 - $1,000+].
- **Shock Absorber Leaks:** The shock absorbers leak hydraulic fluid, causing a loss of damping and a rough ride. Fix: Replacing the shocks [$300 - $600].

### **Electrical**
- **Battery Drain:** The battery drains prematurely due to a parasitic draw from electrical components. Fix: Identifying and fixing the draw [$200 - $500+].
- **Alternator Failure:** The alternator fails to charge the battery, causing electrical system problems. Fix: Replacing the alternator [$500 - $1,000+].

### **Exterior**
- **Window Regulator Failure:** The window regulators malfunction, causing the windows to stick or fail to move. Fix: Replacing the regulator [$200 - $400].
- **Tailgate Hinge Corrosion:** The tailgate hinges corrode, making it difficult to open or close the tailgate. Fix: Replacing the hinges [$300 - $600].

### **Interior**
- **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system fails to maintain desired temperature or air flow. Fix: Replacing the control module or other components [$200 - $600].
- **Steering Wheel Buttons Sticking:** The steering wheel buttons become sticky or unresponsive. Fix: Replacing the buttons or switch assembly [$100 - $300].

### **Summary**
The 2016 GMC Sierra has some common issues that owners should be aware of. The most severe issues involve the engine (cylinder deactivation failure) and transmission (torque converter shudder), which can be costly to repair. Other issues like suspension problems, electrical issues, and interior malfunctions are less serious but can still be inconvenient. The level of severity and cost of the issues vary depending on the specific part and issue.
