### Summary Verdict
The 2021 GMC Sierra 1500 demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its V8 gasoline engines. However, potential owners should be aware of specific concerns, such as oil consumption and turbocharger issues with the 2.7L engine, and AFM lifter problems with the 5.3L V8. The 10-speed automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit harsh shifting. Diesel variants may face DPF or DEF system issues common to modern diesels. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, and minor exterior component issues like the Multi-Flex tailgate are also noted. Overall, while not immune to problems, most issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, making the Sierra a capable, albeit not flawless, choice in the full-size truck segment.
