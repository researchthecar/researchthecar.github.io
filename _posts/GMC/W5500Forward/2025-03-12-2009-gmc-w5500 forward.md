The 2009 GMC W5500 Forward is a medium-duty cab-over truck primarily used for commercial applications. It was available with a 5.2L Isuzu 4HK1-TC turbocharged diesel engine, producing around 200 horsepower and 441 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate the truck's maneuverability in urban environments and its high payload capacity. However, common complaints include parts availability issues and some reliability concerns related to specific components. The truck typically came with an Aisin A465 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, whining noise from the turbocharger, possible engine damage if fragments enter the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Inspect the oil supply line to the turbocharger for blockages and replace if necessary.

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, DPF warning light illuminated, potential for engine shutdown. This can be due to short drive cycles where the DPF is not able to regenerate properly or a faulty sensor in the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Attempt manual DPF regeneration. If regeneration fails, the DPF may need to be cleaned or replaced. Diagnose and repair any underlying issues causing excessive soot production.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the repair.
