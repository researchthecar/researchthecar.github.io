The 2000 GMC W5500 Forward is a medium-duty cab-over truck commonly used for commercial applications like delivery, construction, and service vehicles. The primary engine option for this model year was the Isuzu 4HE1-TC 4.8L turbocharged diesel engine, producing approximately 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. While appreciated for its maneuverability in urban environments and decent fuel economy for its class, common complaints often revolve around parts availability and the higher maintenance costs associated with diesel engines and commercial vehicle components. Other engine options may include the Isuzu 4BD2T.
