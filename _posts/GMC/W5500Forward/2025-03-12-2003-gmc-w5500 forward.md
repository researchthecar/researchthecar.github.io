**Summary**

The 2003 GMC W5500 Forward is a reliable workhorse, but its age means potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the turbocharger and injectors, can be costly. Transmission issues, like slipping gears and torque converter failure, are also common and can be expensive to repair. Suspension and electrical problems are also possible due to the truck's age. Rust can be a major concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Overall, while a well-maintained W5500 can be a great asset, potential buyers should be prepared for possible repairs and maintenance due to the age of the vehicle. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the issue and its severity.
