The 2002 GMC W5500 Forward is a medium-duty cab-over truck often used for delivery services, construction, and other commercial applications. It was commonly equipped with an Isuzu 4HE1-TC 4.8L turbocharged diesel engine producing approximately 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included the Isuzu 4BD2T 3.9L turbo diesel, the Isuzu 6BG1 6.5L diesel, and the GM 5.7L Vortec gas. Transmission options varied, typically including Isuzu manual transmissions such as the MSG 5-speed and the Aisin A465 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the truck's maneuverability and relatively compact size for navigating city streets, while common dislikes revolve around its ride quality and the cost of maintaining a commercial vehicle.
