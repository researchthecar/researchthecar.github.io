The 2007 GMC W5500 Forward is a medium-duty cab-over truck, primarily used for commercial applications such as delivery and service. It's known for its maneuverability and relatively compact size, making it suitable for urban environments. Owners often appreciate the truck's reliability and ease of maintenance, though they may dislike its limited driver comfort and somewhat spartan interior compared to more modern trucks. The 2007 GMC W5500 Forward came equipped with a 5.2L Isuzu 4HK1-TC diesel engine producing 200 horsepower and 441 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with an Aisin A465 6-speed automatic transmission. There were no other engine options available for the 2007 model year.

**Engine**

**5.2L Isuzu 4HK1-TC Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, reduced power, excessive smoke from the exhaust. Often caused by contaminated fuel or normal wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty injector(s). It is recommended to replace all injectors at once for even wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector (parts and labor).

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, loud whistling noise from the engine. Can be caused by oil starvation, foreign object damage, or normal wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Inspect the oil supply line to the turbocharger and replace it if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ (parts and labor).

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, poor acceleration, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR valve. Cleaning can sometimes temporarily resolve the issue, but replacement is often the only permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (parts and labor).

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, check engine light. DPF can become clogged over time, especially with short trips or stop-and-go driving.
    *   Solution: Attempt to force a regeneration cycle. If that fails, the DPF may need to be professionally cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+ for cleaning; $1500 - $3000+ for replacement.

*   **Shifting Problems/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed shifts, slipping between gears, harsh shifting, or failure to shift at all. Can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn clutches, or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Check and top off transmission fluid. If the problem persists, a transmission service (filter and fluid change) may be necessary. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 for fluid change and filter; $2,500 - $5,000+ for rebuild or replacement.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+ (parts and labor).

    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, rough ride, reduced load capacity. Leaf springs can weaken and break over time due to heavy loads and rough roads.
    *   Solution: Replace the damaged or weakened leaf springs. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring (parts and labor).
