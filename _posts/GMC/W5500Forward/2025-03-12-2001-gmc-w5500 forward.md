The 2001 GMC W5500 Forward is a cab-over medium-duty truck designed for commercial use, known for its maneuverability and ease of maintenance compared to conventional trucks. This model year typically features an Isuzu-sourced 4HE1-TC 4.8L Turbo Diesel inline-4 engine producing around 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. Other available engine options for this model year included the Isuzu 4HK1-TC 5.2L Turbo Diesel I4 (later years) and the Isuzu 6HK1-TC 7.8L Turbo Diesel I6. Transmission options include the Aisin A465 4-speed automatic and various manual transmissions depending on the specific configuration. Owners often appreciate the truck's reliability and ease of servicing, but some common complaints involve the availability of specific parts, especially for older models, and the cab-over design leading to increased noise levels in the cabin.
