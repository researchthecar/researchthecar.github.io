The 2009 GMC W5500HD Forward is a medium-duty cab-over truck commonly used for commercial applications like delivery, service, and utility work. The primary engine option for this model year is the Isuzu 5.2L 4HK1-TC turbocharged diesel engine, producing around 200 horsepower and 441 lb-ft of torque. These trucks are generally liked for their maneuverability in urban environments and their relatively high payload capacity. However, some common dislikes include the cab-over design's ride quality and the somewhat cramped interior compared to conventional trucks.
