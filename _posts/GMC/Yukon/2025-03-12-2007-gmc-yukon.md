The 2007 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capability, and comfortable ride. Engine options included the 4.8L Vortec V8 (295 hp, 305 lb-ft torque), the 5.3L Vortec V8 (320 hp, 340 lb-ft torque), and the 6.0L Vortec V8 (366 hp, 380 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission (4L60-E/4L65-E). Owners often appreciate the Yukon's spaciousness and ability to haul cargo or passengers, but some dislike the poor fuel economy and potential for costly repairs as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**4.8L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, fouled spark plugs, and potential engine damage. The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can lead to oil burning and carbon buildup.
    *   Solution: Disable the AFM system with a tuner or replace the AFM lifters with standard lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate or fluctuating oil pressure readings on the gauge. This is often caused by a faulty oil pressure sensor located behind the intake manifold.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor and the screen underneath.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L, the 5.3L with AFM experiences excessive oil consumption, fouled spark plugs, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Disable the AFM system or replace the AFM lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as 4.8L
    *   Solution: Same as 4.8L

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or erratic shifting, difficulty accelerating, and the engine revving high without corresponding vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. Could also be caused by low fluid level or failing solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt and jarring shifts between gears, often accompanied by a clunking noise.
