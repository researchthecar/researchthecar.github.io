The optional Adaptive Air Ride Suspension and the 3.0L Duramax diesel engine are the primary areas where owners have reported specific technical concerns, namely potential issues with the air compressor and DPF regeneration, respectively. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system's software, have also been noted. Overall, the Yukon is a robust vehicle, but prospective buyers opting for the diesel or air suspension should be aware of these potential, though not universal, issues.
