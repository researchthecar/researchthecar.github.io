The 2009 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 4.8L V8 (295 hp, 305 lb-ft torque), a 5.3L V8 (320 hp, 335 lb-ft torque), and a 6.2L V8 (403 hp, 417 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic or a 6-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners generally appreciate the Yukon's ability to haul passengers and cargo, as well as its relatively smooth ride. However, common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, reliability issues, and the vehicle's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels and add oil as needed. In some cases, replacing valve seals or piston rings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8 (Including Active Fuel Management [AFM])**

*   **AFM Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, and potentially the camshaft, is required. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L, some 5.3L engines exhibit excessive oil consumption, especially those with the AFM system.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels, add oil as needed. In some cases, replacing valve seals, AFM lifters, or piston rings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, is a common complaint. This can be due to worn solenoids or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the shift solenoids or rebuilding/replacing the valve body. A complete transmission rebuild might be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6L80E 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially during light acceleration or at highway speeds, is often attributed to torque converter issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter, performing a transmission flush with updated fluid, or a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Delayed or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience delayed or erratic shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can be caused by valve body issues, worn solenoids, or low fluid level.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust the transmission fluid level. Flush the transmission and replace the filter. In some cases, the valve body or solenoids may need to be replaced. A complete transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Autoride Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with the Autoride air suspension system may experience compressor failure, leading to a saggy or uneven ride height.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Autoride Air Shock Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Autoride air shocks themselves can develop leaks, leading to a loss of air pressure and a bouncy or uncomfortable ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**Summary**

The 2009 GMC Yukon has some notable issues, particularly concerning the engine and transmission. The AFM system on the 5.3L V8 is prone to lifter failure, which can be a costly repair. Both the 4-speed and 6-speed transmissions can experience shifting problems requiring repairs ranging from fluid changes to complete rebuilds. Suspension issues with the Autoride system can also add to the cost of ownership. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, making it important to thoroughly inspect a used 2009 GMC Yukon before purchasing.
