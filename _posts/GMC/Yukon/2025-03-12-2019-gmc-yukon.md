Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2019 GMC Yukon, categorized and formatted as requested. The 2019 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV offering a blend of comfort, capability, and towing capacity. It's generally liked for its spacious interior, especially in the XL version, its powerful engine options, and its smooth ride. Common complaints include its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, the dated infotainment system in base trims, and the higher price point compared to some competitors. The 2019 Yukon came with three engine options: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque) paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (base trims) or an 8-speed automatic (most trims), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque) paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and a 2.8L Duramax I4 Turbo-Diesel (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque) paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced power, and potential for complete engine failure. The AFM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, can cause premature lifter failure, particularly in cylinders 1, 4, 6, and 7. This is a widespread issue across GM vehicles equipped with AFM.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, and potentially the camshaft if it has been damaged. Some owners opt to disable the AFM system through tuning or aftermarket devices to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present. This issue is often attributed to the AFM system or faulty valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the root cause (AFM, valve stem seals, piston rings). Repair options range from AFM system disabling to valve stem seal or piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Identical to the 5.3L V8 AFM lifter failure. Ticking noise, misfires, reduced power, and potential for engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM disable is also a common preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L V8, excessive oil consumption between oil changes, potentially with blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the underlying cause, which could include AFM issues, valve stem seals, or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax I4 Turbo-Diesel**

* No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. The transmission may also exhibit delayed engagement when shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change. If the issue persists, valve body inspection and potential replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (8L90)**

*   **"Torque Converter Shudder"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A vibration or shudder, particularly at low speeds (around 20-40 mph) during light acceleration. This is often due to torque converter clutch slippage.
    *   Solution: Revised transmission fluid formulation (Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP) following a service bulletin (TSB) from GM, followed by a transmission flush. In some cases, torque converter replacement may be required if the issue persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 6-speed, harsh or jerky shifting, especially during downshifts. Delayed engagement can also occur.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush with updated fluid. Valve body inspection and possible replacement. Software updates from the dealer can also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging in one corner, bouncy ride, and/or a "Service Ride Control" message on the dashboard. The MRC shocks can leak fluid and fail, affecting the ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected MRC shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per shock, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes requiring a system reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealership. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) to $1,000+ for unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for an extended period. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or may make unusual noises. This can be due to a faulty motor, struts, or sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of the failure. Repair or replacement of the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard (In hot climates)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking appears in the dashboard, usually around the airbag seams or near the windshield. This is exacerbated by exposure to heat and sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2019 GMC Yukon presents a mix of potential issues. The most significant concern centers around the AFM system in the 5.3L and 6.2L V8 engines, which can lead to costly lifter failure. The 8-speed transmission's "torque converter shudder" is another common problem that can be addressed with a fluid flush, but in some cases, requires more extensive repairs. Electrical and interior issues are less frequent but still noteworthy. Overall, while the Yukon offers a comfortable and capable driving experience, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in the potential costs of repair when making their purchase decision.
