The 2016 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft torque) and a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft torque). Both engines are paired with either a 6-speed automatic or an 8-speed automatic transmission, depending on trim and configuration. Owners often praise the Yukon's quiet cabin, smooth ride, and ample cargo space. Common criticisms include the large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and fuel economy that is typical of a large SUV but still a concern for some.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning AFM lifters can cause misfires, rough running, and a ticking or knocking sound. This is often preceded by the check engine light illuminating and codes related to misfires (P0300-P0308) being stored.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected AFM lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners opt to delete the AFM system entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.3L engine is known to consume more oil than expected. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and oil residue on spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover assembly due to an updated PCV design, or piston rings. More drastic cases may require replacing the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, the 6.2L can also experience AFM lifter failure, leading to misfires, rough idling, and unusual engine noises.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty AFM lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM delete is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 6.2L engines exhibit excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-ups.
    *   Solution: Similar to the 5.3L, addressing the valve cover assembly with the PCV and/or replacing piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6L80 transmission can exhibit harsh shifting, particularly between gears, or slipping during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body, rebuilding the transmission, or replacing the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8L90 8-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **"Torque Converter Shudder"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8L90 transmission is notorious for a "torque converter shudder," often described as a vibration or shaking sensation at certain speeds, primarily during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: A triple flush with an updated transmission fluid (Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP). Torque converter replacement is sometimes needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8L90 transmission may exhibit harsh or erratic shifting patterns, as well as delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicles equipped with Magnetic Ride Control (often on Denali trims) may experience failure of the shocks. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, poor handling, and "Service Ride Control" message on the dashboard. Leaking fluid may also be visible.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected MRC shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or unresponsive touchscreen. Bluetooth connectivity problems are also common.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the infotainment module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing parasitic drain (often related to aftermarket accessories or faulty modules) and replacing the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or may become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate struts, motor, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking and splitting of the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent or weak air conditioning performance, often due to a failing compressor or refrigerant leak.
    * Solution: Replacing the AC compressor, condenser, or repairing refrigerant leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2016 GMC Yukon, while a capable and comfortable SUV, is prone to several common issues. The most significant concern is related to the AFM system in both the 5.3L and 6.2L engines, potentially leading to costly repairs. The 8-speed transmission (8L90) is also known for its shuddering issues, which may require multiple fluid changes or more extensive repairs. Electrical issues, suspension issues, and interior trim problems can also arise. The severity and cost of these issues range from relatively minor fixes to major engine or transmission overhauls, potentially making long-term ownership expensive.
