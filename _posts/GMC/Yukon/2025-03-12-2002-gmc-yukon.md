The 2002 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Available engine options included the 4.8L Vortec V8 (285 hp, 295 lb-ft torque), the 5.3L Vortec V8 (285 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque in 2WD or 270 hp and 315 lb-ft of torque in 4WD), and the 6.0L Vortec V8 (320 hp, 360 lb-ft torque). A 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission was standard across all engine options. Owners generally appreciated the Yukon's versatility and dependability for family hauling and work tasks. However, common complaints centered around fuel economy, the age of the vehicles and the wear and tear that comes with it, and some recurring mechanical issues.
