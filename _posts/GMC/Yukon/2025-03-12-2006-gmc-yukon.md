The 2006 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capability, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 4.8L V8 (295 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (295 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque in iron block form, and 310 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque in aluminum block form), and a 6.0L V8 (365 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Yukon's versatility and passenger capacity, but some common complaints revolve around fuel economy, electrical issues, and suspension components.

**Summary:**

The 2006 GMC Yukon, while generally reliable, can suffer from common issues related to engine oil consumption and lifter tick, especially in the 5.3L V8 engines. Transmission problems such as harsh shifting and torque converter failure with the 4L60E are also relatively frequent. Suspension issues, particularly with the Autoride system, and electrical problems like instrument cluster and door lock actuator failures, can add to the ownership costs. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences like AC actuator clicks to major repairs like engine or transmission replacement. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the issue and the extent of the damage.
