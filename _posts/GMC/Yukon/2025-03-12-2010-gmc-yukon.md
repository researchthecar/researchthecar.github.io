The 2010 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capability. Engine options for the 2010 Yukon include a 4.8L V8 (295 hp and 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (320 hp and 335 lb-ft of torque, or 326 hp and 348 lb-ft of torque in some trims), and a 6.2L V8 (403 hp and 417 lb-ft of torque). The transmissions available are a 4-speed automatic and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Yukon's ability to haul passengers and cargo, while common complaints include fuel economy and some reliability concerns related to age and mileage.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idle, and potential engine damage due to cylinder deactivation issues. The AFM system, designed to improve fuel economy, can cause these issues as the engine ages.
    *   Solution: Disabling the AFM system (using a tuner or AFM disabler device) or replacing the AFM lifters and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L, excessive oil consumption, rough idle, and potential engine damage are common complaints.
    *   Solution: Disabling AFM or replacing AFM components (lifters, VLOM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous low oil pressure readings, potentially causing the engine to shut down or the "check engine" light to illuminate. The sensor itself fails.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report high oil consumption on vehicles that have clocked over 100,000 miles.
    *   Solution: Replacing valve seals and piston rings can reduce oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4L60E)**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates when shifting between gears or shifts roughly.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change, or replacement of worn solenoids/valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,500+ depending on the severity and parts needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (6L80E)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, particularly under light acceleration. Often due to torque converter clutch failure.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush (using updated fluid) or torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Harsh Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission has very harsh shifts between gears or clunks loudly.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement to correct any valves that are sticking open or closed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Autoride System Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Autoride system, which uses electronically controlled shocks, can fail, leading to a rough ride and error messages. Air suspension components such as the air compressor can also fail in the rear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed shocks or air compressor/components. Some owners opt to replace the system with conventional shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,500+ per shock, or $500-$1200+ for the compressor/air lines
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door locks may fail to lock or unlock properly, or may function intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Instrument Panel Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The speedometer, fuel gauge, or other gauges may malfunction or become inaccurate.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor only works on certain speeds (typically high) or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower body panels, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Repairing the rust damage and repainting the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in hot climates or areas with high UV exposure.
    *   Solution: Replacing or covering the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the chosen solution
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 GMC Yukon, while generally a reliable SUV, can experience issues common with vehicles of its age and mileage. The most significant and potentially costly problems revolve around the Active Fuel Management system in the 4.8L and 5.3L V8 engines, leading to oil consumption and potential engine damage. Transmission issues, particularly with the 6L80E, can also be expensive to address. Other electrical and suspension issues are less severe but can contribute to the overall cost of ownership. When purchasing a used 2010 Yukon, it's crucial to have a pre-purchase inspection performed to assess the condition of the engine, transmission, and suspension components, and to check for any signs of rust.
