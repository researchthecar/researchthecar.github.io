The 2001 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capabilities. It was available with three engine options: a 4.8L Vortec V8 (275 hp, 290 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L Vortec V8 (285 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L Vortec V8 (320 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Yukon's versatility and roominess, but common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, some mechanical issues related to age, and the cost of maintenance. Many owners also appreciate the old-school styling of the vehicle but don't like some of the comfort/tech features that weren't available during that model year.

The 2001 GMC Yukon, while a capable and spacious SUV, is showing its age. Common issues range from engine oil consumption and transmission problems to electrical glitches and suspension wear. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine rebuilds or transmission replacements, can be quite costly. Due to the age of the vehicle, it is important to thoroughly inspect the vehicle to ensure that any pre-existing issues are known before purchase.
