The 2022 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV that offers a blend of luxury, capability, and spaciousness. It's a popular choice for families and those who need to tow or haul cargo. While it is generally well-regarded, some owners have reported certain issues. Available engine options include the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), the 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and the 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Many owners praise the Yukon for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and powerful engine options. However, some common complaints include the complexity of the infotainment system, some electronic gremlins, and the high price point, especially for higher trim levels.
