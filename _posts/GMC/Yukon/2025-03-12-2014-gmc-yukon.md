Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2014 GMC Yukon, categorized by component and specifying engine/transmission options where applicable.

The 2014 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capability, and comfortable ride. It was offered with three engine options: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and a 4.8L V8 (320 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque) (generally for the Yukon SLE trim). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (Hydra-Matic 6L80). People generally liked the Yukon's ample cargo space and comfortable seating. Common complaints included fuel economy, the outdated interior design (compared to newer SUVs), and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (L83)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, reduced power, check engine light. Often caused by a faulty lifter collapsing due to the AFM system deactivating cylinders. Can lead to camshaft damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected lifters, camshaft, and potentially other related components. AFM delete kits are also a common alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and AFM delete option)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, needing to add oil frequently between oil changes. Can be caused by faulty valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Solution: Replace valve stem seals or piston rings. More extensive engine rebuild may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (L86)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, reduced power, check engine light. Similar to the 5.3L, this engine can experience AFM lifter failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected lifters, camshaft, and potentially other related components. AFM delete kits are also a common alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and AFM delete option)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, needing to add oil frequently between oil changes. Similar to the 5.3L, can be caused by faulty valve stem seals or piston rings.

    *   Solution: Valve body replacement, solenoid replacement, or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ (depending on the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibration or shuddering felt, especially at lower speeds. Caused by torque converter clutch issues.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement or transmission flush with a friction modifier additive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ (depending on the solution)

    *   Solution: Replace air shocks, compressor, or both. Convert to a standard suspension system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the components replaced and conversion to non-autoride)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery overnight or after short periods of non-use. Caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.

**Summary**

The 2014 GMC Yukon has some common issues, with the most significant being related to the Active Fuel Management system in the 5.3L and 6.2L engines and the 6L80 transmission.  AFM lifter failure can be a costly repair. Electrical and suspension issues are also present.  While some issues can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as engine or transmission rebuilds, can be quite costly, indicating moderate to high potential repair expenses for this vehicle.
