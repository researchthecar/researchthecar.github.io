The 2018 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capability, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 5.3L V8 engine producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.2L V8 engine producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. The 5.3L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.2L engine is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Yukon for its size, luxury features (depending on the trim level), and powerful engine options. Common dislikes include its large size making it hard to park and maneuver, and its relatively low fuel economy.

**Engine**

**5.3L V8 Engine**
* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illuminated. Often occurs due to a collapsed lifter on one of the cylinders deactivated by the AFM system.
    * Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners opt to disable the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Low oil levels between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, potential engine damage if oil levels are not monitored and maintained.
    * Solution: There is no definitive fix. Some owners have tried replacing the PCV valve, or switching to a higher viscosity oil. More extensive repairs involve replacing piston rings, which is a costly repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8 Engine**
* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illuminated. Similar to the 5.3L engine, this is often caused by a collapsed lifter due to the AFM system.
    * Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners opt to disable the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Low oil pressure warning, engine knocking, potential engine damage if not addressed quickly.
    * Solution: Replacing the oil pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Paired with 5.3L Engine)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, slipping sensation during acceleration.
    * Solution: Transmission flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission (Paired with 6.2L Engine)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, slipping sensation during acceleration.
    * Solution: Software update, transmission flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vibration or shuddering at certain speeds, especially during light acceleration.
    * Solution: Transmission flush with updated fluid, torque converter replacement in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or bouncy ride, clunking noises from the suspension, "Service Suspension System" warning.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected MRC shocks/struts. This can be an expensive repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per shock/strut
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, inability to maintain proper ride height, "Service Suspension System" warning.
    * Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor, potentially replacing air springs if damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Infotainment screen freezing, system randomly rebooting, loss of functionality.
    * Solution: Software update, replacement of the infotainment unit in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle, frequent jump starts required.
    * Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic drain (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in warmer climates.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 GMC Yukon has some potential issues that buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly AFM lifter failure and excessive oil consumption, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially harsh shifting with both the 6-speed and 10-speed options, are also a concern. Suspension issues, primarily related to the Magnetic Ride Control and air suspension systems, can also lead to significant repair bills. Electrical gremlins in the infotainment system and battery drain issues can be frustrating. The cracked dashboard is mostly aesthetic but can also be a costly fix. Overall, potential buyers should have the vehicle inspected by a trusted mechanic before purchase, paying close attention to these common problem areas. Be sure to ask the seller if the AFM has been disabled on the vehicle as a pre-emptive measure.
