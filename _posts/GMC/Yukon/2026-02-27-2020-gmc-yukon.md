### Summary Verdict
The 2020 GMC Yukon offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly with its robust V8 engines. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in both the 5.3L and 6.2L engines, which can lead to costly repairs if not addressed. The 10-speed automatic transmission, while offering better fuel economy, has seen some reports of rough shifting. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are also present but not overwhelmingly common. The suspension and exterior/interior components are largely free of widespread defects. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any AFM-related symptoms are recommended for optimal long-term reliability.
