**Summary**

The 2003 GMC Yukon, while a capable and versatile SUV, is now over 20 years old, and common issues reflect its age. Engine oil consumption, intake manifold gasket leaks, and transmission problems with the 4L60-E are some of the more significant concerns. Electrical issues such as instrument cluster failure and door lock actuator problems are also common. Rust and interior cracking are typical cosmetic issues. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect any used 2003 Yukon and be prepared for potential maintenance needs.
