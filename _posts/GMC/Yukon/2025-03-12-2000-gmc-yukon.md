The 2000 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capability, and truck-based durability. Engine options included the 4.8L Vortec V8 (275 hp, 290 lb-ft torque), the 5.3L Vortec V8 (285 hp, 325 lb-ft torque), and the 6.0L Vortec V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with the 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Yukon's comfortable ride and ample cargo space, while common dislikes include its fuel economy and some reliability issues associated with older models.
