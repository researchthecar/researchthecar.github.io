### Summary Verdict
The 2018 GMC Yukon is a generally reliable large SUV, with its V8 engines and automatic transmissions proving to be robust for most users. The most commonly cited technical issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the V8 engines, which can lead to lifter problems and increased oil consumption if not addressed. Transmission issues, while not pervasive, can include torque converter problems or fluid leaks. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and intermittent battery drain, are also noted. Optional suspension systems like air suspension or Magnetic Ride Control can also present repair needs. Overall, the Yukon offers solid dependability, but potential buyers should be aware of the AFM system's known quirks and factor in potential costs for these specific repairs.
