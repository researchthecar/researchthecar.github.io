Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues reported for the 2021 GMC Yukon, formatted for your website and tailored to specific engine and transmission configurations. The 2021 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV that offers a blend of comfort, capability, and technology. It's known for its spacious interior, especially in the extended-length Yukon XL, and its powerful engine options. Owners often praise its smooth ride, refined interior, and impressive towing capacity. However, some common complaints revolve around the vehicle's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and the higher trims can be quite expensive.

The 2021 GMC Yukon comes with several engine options: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I6 (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.3L V8, equipped with Active Fuel Management (AFM) or Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM), is prone to lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light. The issue is due to the deactivation system causing excessive wear on the lifters.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder head. Some owners opt to disable AFM/DFM via aftermarket tuning to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, the 6.2L V8 can also experience lifter failure due to AFM/DFM. Symptoms are the same: ticking/knocking noise, rough idle, misfires, and check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters. Disabling AFM/DFM is a common preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I6**

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh shifting, particularly between lower gears, as well as slipping or delayed engagement when accelerating. These issues can stem from valve body problems, internal wear, or software glitches.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) reflash can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or, in rare instances, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: TCM reflash: $150 - $300. Valve body replacement: $1,200 - $2,500. Transmission rebuild/replacement: $3,500 - $7,000+.

    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty air compressor, air struts, or sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air compressor replacement: $800 - $1,500. Air strut replacement (each): $600 - $1,200. Sensor replacement: $200 - $500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
