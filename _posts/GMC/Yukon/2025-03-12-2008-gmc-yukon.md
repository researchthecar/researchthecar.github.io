The 2008 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 4.8L V8 (295 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (320 hp, 340 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L V8 (380 hp, 417 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options are primarily the 4L60E 4-speed automatic and the 4L70E 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners generally appreciate the Yukon's ability to haul cargo and passengers, as well as its smooth highway driving. Common dislikes include its fuel economy and some reported reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. May be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels frequently and address any underlying issues, such as worn valve seals or piston rings. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, and potential engine damage. The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy but can lead to lifter failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM delete kits are also available to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L, excessive oil consumption can be a problem.
    *   Solution: Regularly check oil levels and address any leaks or internal engine issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
        *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8**

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous or fluctuating oil pressure readings on the dashboard gauge. Can lead to false alarms or delayed notification of genuine low oil pressure.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VVT Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, rough idling, and potential check engine light illumination.
