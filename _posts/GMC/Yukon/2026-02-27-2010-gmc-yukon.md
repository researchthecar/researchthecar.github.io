### Summary Verdict
The 2010 GMC Yukon generally offers good reliability, particularly with its larger V8 engines. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the 5.3L V8, which can lead to oil consumption and internal engine wear if not addressed. Transmission issues, such as torque converter shudder, are also noted but often repairable with fluid changes or component replacement. For models equipped with the optional Autoride suspension, air compressor and air spring failures are potential concerns. Electrical issues like power window motors and infotainment glitches are present but not overwhelmingly frequent. Overall, the Yukon is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the AFM system and consider vehicles with maintenance records that show attention to these known areas.
