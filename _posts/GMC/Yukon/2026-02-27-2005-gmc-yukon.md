### Summary Verdict
The 2005 GMC Yukon is generally a reliable vehicle, especially concerning its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The larger 6.0L V8 engine is particularly noted for its durability. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the 5.3L V8's Active Fuel Management system and intake manifold gaskets. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60-E, can arise with age and mileage, often related to the torque converter or internal clutch packs. Suspension components like ball joints are subject to wear, and if equipped, the rear air suspension can be a source of repair costs. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, are also documented. Overall, while not immune to problems, the 2005 Yukon offers a solid platform with manageable repair concerns for its class.
