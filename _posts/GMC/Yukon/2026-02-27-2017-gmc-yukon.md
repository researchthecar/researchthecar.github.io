### Summary Verdict
The 2017 GMC Yukon is a generally reliable full-size SUV, with its V8 engines and automatic transmissions performing well for the most part. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in both the 5.3L and 6.2L engines, which can lead to lifter problems and increased oil consumption. Transmission issues, such as rough shifting and torque converter shudder, are also reported but often addressable with fluid changes or software updates. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are present but not pervasive. The suspension and exterior/interior components are largely free of widespread complaints. Overall, the Yukon offers a dependable experience, especially if potential AFM-related maintenance is considered.
