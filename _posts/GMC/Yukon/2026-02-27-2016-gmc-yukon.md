### Summary Verdict
The 2016 GMC Yukon, while generally a reliable large SUV, exhibits some common issues primarily related to its advanced engine technology (AFM lifter problems and oil consumption) and the complexity of its automatic transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and intermittent battery drain, are also noted. Less common but still reported are issues with optional suspension components like Magnetic Ride Control and power liftgate failures. Owners should be aware of these potential repair areas, especially concerning the V8 engines and their associated systems. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate the severity and cost of these repairs.
