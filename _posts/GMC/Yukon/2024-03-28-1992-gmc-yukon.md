**Introduction:**

The 1992 GMC Yukon was a popular full-size SUV that shared many components with its Chevrolet Suburban sibling. It was powered by a variety of V8 engines and offered with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission. The Yukon was praised for its spacious interior, powerful engines, and rugged off-road capabilities. However, it was also known for its less-than-stellar fuel economy and somewhat dated interior design.
