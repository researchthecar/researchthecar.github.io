*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, delayed or hesitant shifting, transmission warning light illumination.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause (e.g., low fluid, internal damage). May require transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) to $4,000 - $8,000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Ride Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one side, compressor running constantly, "service suspension" warning light, rough ride.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the leak (e.g., air struts, lines, compressor). Replacement of faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per air strut, $300 - $800+ for compressor replacement

**Summary**

The 2023 GMC Yukon, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, has some potential issues to watch out for. Engine-related problems, particularly AFM/DFM lifter failure, can be severe and costly. Transmission issues like harsh shifting and slipping are also fairly common complaints. Electrical glitches, especially with the infotainment system, can be annoying. Suspension issues mainly affect models equipped with the air ride or magnetic ride control, and these can be expensive to fix. While not every Yukon will experience these problems, being aware of them can help potential buyers make an informed decision and properly inspect the vehicle. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, and the cost to repair can vary significantly depending on the problem and the extent of the damage.
