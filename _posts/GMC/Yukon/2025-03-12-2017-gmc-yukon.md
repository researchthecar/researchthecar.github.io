Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2017 GMC Yukon, organized by category and engine/transmission option. This is based on publicly available information from owner forums, repair databases, and recall information sources. Keep in mind that individual experiences may vary, and this is not an exhaustive list.

The 2017 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capacity. The available engine options include the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). The 5.3L engine is typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.2L engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People like the Yukon for its size, capability, and features. Common complaints include the large size making it difficult to park, poor fuel economy, and some reliability concerns as detailed below.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. The lifters on these cylinders can fail, leading to misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. The check engine light may illuminate. This is a common issue across several GM vehicles with this engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system entirely to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally large amount of oil between oil changes. This can be due to worn piston rings, valve seals, or the AFM system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is needed to determine the cause. Options include replacing piston rings, valve seals, or repairing/disabling the AFM system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, the AFM lifters can fail, causing misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally large amount of oil between oil changes. This can be due to worn piston rings, valve seals, or the AFM system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is needed to determine the cause. Options include replacing piston rings, valve seals, or repairing/disabling the AFM system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Typically paired with 5.3L V8)**

*No Issues Found*

**8-Speed Automatic (Typically paired with 6.2L V8)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission exhibits harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between lower gears. Some owners report hesitation when accelerating. This is often attributed to valve body issues or torque converter problems.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve some issues. However, more severe cases may require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Magnetic Ride Control shocks can leak or fail, leading to a bouncy or uncomfortable ride. Error messages related to the suspension system may appear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty MRC shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, become unresponsive, or exhibit glitches. Common issues include Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation errors, and screen failures.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ (depending on the fix)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly. This can be due to a faulty motor, latch, or sensor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack, particularly in warmer climates. This is often due to sun exposure and material degradation.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 GMC Yukon, particularly those equipped with the 6.2L V8 and 8-speed transmission, can experience some significant issues. The most concerning are the engine problems (AFM lifter failure and oil consumption), which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting in the 8-speed, are also common. While some electrical and interior issues exist, they are generally less severe. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have any used Yukon thoroughly inspected before purchasing.
