- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil level drops between changes, blue smoke from exhaust.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis may involve checking PCV system, piston rings, or valve seals. Repairs can be extensive.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $4,000+


### 6.2L EcoTec3 V8
**Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light, potential engine knocking sounds.
- **Solution:** Replacement of lifters, camshaft, and potentially the oil pump. Some owners opt for AFM disablation kits.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,000

**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil level drops between changes, blue smoke from exhaust.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis may involve checking PCV system, piston rings, or valve seals. Repairs can be extensive.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $4,000+


## Transmission

### 6-Speed Automatic (6L80/6L90)
**Hesitation or Shuddering**
- **Symptoms:** Noticeable delay when shifting into gear, rough shifts, or shuddering during acceleration.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid flush and refill, software updates, or internal transmission repairs.
- **Cost:** $300 - $1,500

**Overheating**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission warning light, slipping gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Inspection of transmission cooler, fluid levels, and internal components. May require cooler replacement or transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2,500+


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Sensor/Component Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Harsh ride, clunking noises, suspension warning light, vehicle leaning to one side.
- **Solution:** Replacement of faulty MRC sensors, struts, or control module.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1,200 per component


### Air Suspension (if equipped)
**Air Spring Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Vehicle sagging, especially overnight; compressor running excessively; suspension warning light.
- **Solution:** Replacement of leaking air springs or air lines.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800 per spring


## Electrical

### Infotainment System
**Screen Freezing or Unresponsiveness**
- **Symptoms:** Touchscreen fails to respond, system freezes, reboots unexpectedly.
- **Solution:** Software updates, system resets, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
- **Cost:** $200 - $1,000


### Battery Drain
**Parasitic Battery Drain**
- **Symptoms:** Dead battery after sitting for a short period, requires frequent jump starts.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis to identify the parasitic draw (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory) and repair or replace the component.
- **Cost:** $150 - $600

### Summary Verdict
The 2015 GMC Yukon generally demonstrates good reliability, especially considering its size and complexity. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the EcoTec3 V8 engines, which can lead to lifter problems and oil consumption. Transmission issues, while not pervasive, can include hesitation or overheating. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Suspension components, especially those with advanced systems like Magnetic Ride Control or air suspension, can be costly to repair if they fail. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of AFM issues can significantly contribute to a positive ownership experience.
