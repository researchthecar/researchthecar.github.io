### Summary Verdict
The 2008 GMC Yukon is a generally reliable full-size SUV, particularly with its larger V8 engines. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the 5.3L and 6.0L engines, which can lead to oil consumption and internal wear if not addressed. Transmission issues, especially with the 4-speed automatic, can include torque converter problems and overheating. Electrical components like the Body Control Module and alternator have also seen some reports of premature failure. Suspension components, particularly ball joints and bushings, are wear items that may require replacement. Owners should be aware of these potential issues, especially the AFM system, and factor in potential repair costs for a vehicle of this age.
