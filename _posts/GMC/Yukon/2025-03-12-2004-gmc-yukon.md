The 2004 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 4.8L V8 (285 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (295 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (325 hp, 370 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Yukon's large cargo area and passenger capacity, but common complaints included poor fuel economy and age-related mechanical issues. The following issues reflect common complaints specific to the 2004 model year and exclude general wear and tear.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. The rate of consumption can vary, but often exceeds 1 quart per 1,000 miles.
    *   Solution: A potential fix is to replace the valve stem seals and/or piston rings. Performing an engine flush prior to repairs may help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L, the 5.3L engine also has reports of excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Same as above, replacing valve stem seals and/or piston rings are the common repair. An engine flush may help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lifter Tick/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold, can indicate a failing or collapsed lifter. This can eventually lead to misfires and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifter(s) and potentially the camshaft if damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ depending on how many lifters need replacing and if it caused damage to the camshaft.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L and 5.3L, the 6.0L engine also has reports of excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Same as above, replacing valve stem seals and/or piston rings are the common repair. An engine flush may help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60-E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Slipping can also occur, where the engine revs without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: Could require a transmission fluid flush and filter change, valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200+ for a fluid change, $500 - $1,500 for valve body work, $2,000 - $4,000+ for a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration felt at certain speeds, especially under light acceleration, indicates a potential torque converter issue.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ for torque converter replacement, $2,000 - $4,000+ for a rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, compressor not running, or "Service Ride Control" message.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air compressor, air shocks/springs, or ride height sensors. A conversion to coil springs is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per air shock, $200 - $500+ for the compressor, $500 - $1,500+ for a coil spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front end, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn ball joints and tie rod ends. An alignment is necessary after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per ball joint/tie rod end (including labor), plus $100 - $200 for an alignment.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges not working properly (speedometer, fuel gauge, etc.), dim or flickering display.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument cluster. Aftermarket repair services are available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for repair, $300 - $600+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows not rolling up or down, door locks not functioning.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty window regulators, door lock actuators, or the master control switch.

**Summary**

The 2004 GMC Yukon can be a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly given its age. Engine-related problems such as oil consumption and lifter failure can be costly, as can transmission issues like slipping and hard shifting. Suspension problems, particularly with the air suspension, can also arise. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster and power accessory failures, are also common. Body rust can be a significant problem, especially in areas with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, making a thorough inspection before purchase essential.
