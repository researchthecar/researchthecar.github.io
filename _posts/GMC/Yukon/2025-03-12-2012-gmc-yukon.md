The 2012 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 4.8L V8 (320 hp, 335 lb-ft torque), a 5.3L V8 (320 hp, 335 lb-ft torque), and a 6.2L V8 (403 hp, 417 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Yukon's ability to haul large families and cargo, its relatively quiet cabin, and its powerful engine options. Common complaints include lower fuel economy compared to smaller SUVs, potential for costly repairs due to the vehicle's complexity, and some interior materials feeling less premium than competitors.
