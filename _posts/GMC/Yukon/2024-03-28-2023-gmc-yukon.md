**2023 GMC Yukon: Common Issues**

The 2023 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV available with two engine options: a 5.3L V8 and a 6.2L V8. Transmission options include a 10-speed automatic. The Yukon is praised for its spacious interior, powerful engines, and towing capabilities, but it also faces some quality issues.

**Engine**

**5.3L V8**
* **Intake manifold leak:** Air leaks from the intake manifold gaskets, causing rough idle, reduced power, and increased emissions. Replaced gaskets solve the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000
* **Fuel injector failure:** Faulty fuel injectors can cause engine misfires, rough running, and decreased fuel efficiency. Replacement of injectors is necessary. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400 per injector
* **Oil leak from oil pan gasket:** A leaking oil pan gasket allows engine oil to escape. Replacing the gasket resolves the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $500

**6.2L V8**
* **Cylinder deactivation issues:** The engine's cylinder deactivation system may malfunction, leading to engine vibrations, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. A software update or replacement of components addresses the problem. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500
* **Lifter tick:** A tapping noise from the valve train indicates worn or damaged lifters. Replacement of lifters and associated components is the solution. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000 - $2,000+

**Transmission**

**10-speed automatic**
* **Hesitation and rough shifting:** The transmission may hesitate or shift roughly, especially during acceleration. Software updates and/or transmission component replacements address the issues. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $2,000+
* **Transmission fluid leak:** A leak from the transmission case or lines can result in reduced fluid levels and potential transmission failure. Replacing seals or components fixes the leak. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $1,000

**Suspension**

* **Rear suspension noise:** A clunking or squeaking noise from the rear suspension when going over bumps is often caused by worn bushings or struts. Replacing the affected components eliminates the noise. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000 per side

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** A parasitic battery drain can deplete the battery overnight. Identifying and disconnecting the faulty component is the solution. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $500+
* **Infotainment system glitches:** The infotainment system may experience glitches such as freezing, lagging, or losing connectivity. Software updates or hardware replacements resolve the issues. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+

**Exterior**

* **Headlight condensation:** Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing is a common issue, reducing visibility. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400 per headlight

**Interior**

* **Sunroof leaks:** Leaks around the sunroof can allow water to enter the cabin. Realignment or replacement of the sunroof components fixes the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+
* **Rear seatbelt buckle failure:** The rear seatbelt buckles may fail to latch or release properly. Replacement of the buckle assembly resolves the problem. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400 per buckle

**Summary**

The 2023 GMC Yukon faces several potential issues, including engine leaks, transmission problems, suspension noise, electrical glitches, and interior component failures. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some requiring minor repairs while others can be more expensive to address. Overall, the reliability of the Yukon is somewhat compromised by these reported issues.
