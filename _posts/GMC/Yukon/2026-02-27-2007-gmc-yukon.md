### Summary Verdict
The 2007 GMC Yukon is a capable and generally dependable full-size SUV. The most frequently reported issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the V8 engines, leading to oil consumption and potential internal damage if not addressed. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60-E, can include torque converter and solenoid problems. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and premature alternator failure are also noted. Exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling are common for vehicles of this age. While these potential problems exist, many are repairable, and proactive maintenance can mitigate some risks. Overall, the Yukon offers good value, but potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas.
