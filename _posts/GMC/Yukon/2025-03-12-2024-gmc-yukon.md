Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2024 GMC Yukon, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2024 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine options, and comfortable ride. It is available with three engine options: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel producing 277 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Yukon's ample cargo space, smooth ride quality, and advanced technology features. Common dislikes include its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and high fuel consumption.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light. Often occurs at relatively low mileage. The AFM/DFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but the lifters in this system are prone to failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft if damaged. Some owners choose to disable the AFM/DFM system altogether with aftermarket tuning to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+ (depending on damage and shop rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. May be related to the AFM/DFM system or faulty valve seals.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial to determine the root cause. Options range from replacing valve seals to addressing AFM/DFM issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the issue and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Consider AFM/DFM disablement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+ (depending on damage and shop rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial to determine the root cause. Options range from replacing valve seals to addressing AFM/DFM issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the issue and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls, loss of power, hard starting, check engine light. Potential for metal contamination in the fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replace the HPFP. Thoroughly flush the entire fuel system to remove any metal debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ (depending on the extent of contamination)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hard Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears. Hesitation or delays when shifting.
    *   Solution: Software reflash/update of the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (reflash) - $1,500+ (valve body)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine revs high without the vehicle accelerating properly, or the transmission may hesitate to engage a gear. This can also present with clunking or grinding sounds.
    * Solution: A software reflash is required, but some cases may require the entire transmission to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (reflash) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Ride Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension fails to maintain proper ride height, the vehicle sags or is uneven, the compressor is noisy or doesn't function.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the leak is critical. Components that are often replaced are airbags and air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the failed component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, screen blackouts, connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates or replacement of the infotainment screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,200+ (screen replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery is dead, or you must jump start the vehicle. The car dies quickly after sitting for only a few days.
    *   Solution: Replace the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Running Board Malfunctions (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Running boards fail to extend or retract properly, make excessive noise, or become stuck.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the running board mechanisms. Replacement of the motor or the entire running board assembly if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (lubrication/cleaning) - $800+ (motor/assembly replacement per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

**Summary**

The 2024 GMC Yukon can have issues ranging from relatively minor infotainment glitches to more significant powertrain problems. The AFM/DFM lifter failure and HPFP failure (on the diesel) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues are common across all engine options. While some issues can be addressed with software updates, others require more extensive mechanical work. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing a used Yukon.
