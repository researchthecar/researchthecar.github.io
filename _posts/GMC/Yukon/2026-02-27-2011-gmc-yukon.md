### Summary Verdict
The 2011 GMC Yukon, particularly models equipped with the 5.3L, 6.0L, or 6.2L V8 engines, can be susceptible to issues with the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, specifically lifter failure, which can lead to significant engine problems. Oil consumption is another concern that may arise. The 6-speed automatic transmission, while generally robust, can experience torque converter issues or fluid leaks. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module or infotainment system, are also reported. Less common but notable issues include malfunctioning Magnetic Ride Control components and interior comfort features like heated seats. Overall, the Yukon is a capable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific potential failure points, especially concerning the AFM system and transmission.
