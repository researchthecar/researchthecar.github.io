The 2015 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV that offers a blend of capability, comfort, and technology. Available engine options include a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 engine producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, and an optional 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 engine producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Yukon's spacious interior, strong towing capacity, and smooth ride. However, common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, excessive oil consumption in some engines, and various electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, can lead to premature lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, often along with the camshaft, is the common repair. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 5.3L engines experience excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be due to piston ring issues or valve seal problems.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, solutions range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive engine work like piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, the AFM system on the 6.2L can also cause lifter failure. The symptoms are identical: ticking, misfires, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft is necessary. AFM disablement is also a common preventive measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation upon acceleration can also occur.
    *   Solution: A software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) might resolve the issue. In other cases, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magneride Shock Absorber Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Magneride suspension system, which uses magnetically controlled shocks for a smoother ride, can experience shock absorber failure. Symptoms include a bouncy or unstable ride, fluid leaks from the shocks, and a "Service Ride Control" message on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed Magneride shock absorbers is the only solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system is known to freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve the issue. However, some owners have needed to replace the entire infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera can fail to display an image, show a distorted picture, or intermittently cut out.
    *   Solution: Check the wiring connections to the camera first. If the wiring is good, the camera itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or may make unusual noises during operation. This can be due to a faulty liftgate motor, struts, or latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty component is necessary. This could be the motor, struts, or latch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracking of the dashboard, particularly in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard is the only real solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2015 GMC Yukon has several potential issues owners may face. The most significant are engine-related, particularly AFM lifter failure and excessive oil consumption in the 5.3L and 6.2L engines. These repairs can be quite costly. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and backup camera are also common, although typically less expensive to resolve. Suspension problems, particularly with the Magneride system, can also be a significant expense. It is important to carefully inspect any potential 2015 Yukon purchase and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
