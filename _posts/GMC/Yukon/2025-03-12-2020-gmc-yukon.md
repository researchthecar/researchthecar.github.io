The 2020 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV offering a blend of capability, comfort, and technology. It was available with three engine options: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo Diesel (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). The 5.3L V8 and the 6.2L V8 were paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L Duramax Turbo Diesel was paired with the same 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Yukon for its spacious interior, powerful engine options (particularly the 6.2L), and comfortable ride. Common complaints include the vehicle's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, less-than-stellar fuel economy, and some reported issues with the infotainment system.

**Summary**

The 2020 GMC Yukon can suffer from a range of issues, with the most potentially costly being engine-related problems like AFM/DFM lifter failures, which can affect both the 5.3L and 6.2L V8 engines. Transmission issues, while not always severe, can lead to annoying drivability problems. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and battery drain are also fairly common complaints. The frequency and severity of these issues can vary, and preventative maintenance is crucial. Addressing these problems early can help prevent more significant and expensive repairs down the road.
