The 2004 GMC Envoy XUV was a unique SUV that attempted to blend the practicality of an SUV with the open-air cargo bed of a pickup truck. It came standard with a 4.2L inline-6 engine producing 275 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4L60-E 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Envoy XUV for its innovative retractable roof and versatile cargo area, but disliked its quirky styling, limited towing capacity compared to traditional trucks, and some reliability issues. The 5.3L V8 with 302 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque was an available engine option.

**Summary**

The 2004 GMC Envoy XUV, while offering a unique blend of SUV and pickup truck functionality, suffers from a range of issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems like ignition coil failures and oil consumption (particularly with the 5.3L V8) can be costly to address. Transmission issues are also a concern, with the 4L60-E prone to slipping and torque converter failures. Electrical problems, including instrument cluster malfunctions and BCM issues, further contribute to the vehicle's overall reliability concerns. The retractable roof, the vehicle's defining feature, is also a source of potential problems. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to identify potential problems before making a purchase.
