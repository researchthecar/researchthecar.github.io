The 2005 GMC Envoy XUV was a unique SUV that combined features of a traditional SUV with a pickup truck, thanks to its retractable roof and midgate. It was available with two engine options: a 4.2L Inline-6 engine producing 275 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque and a 5.3L V8 engine producing 300 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4L60-E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the XUV's versatility and cargo-carrying capabilities, while common dislikes included its quirky design, lower fuel economy than expected, and some reliability concerns.
