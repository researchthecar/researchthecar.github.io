### Summary Verdict
The 2005 GMC Envoy XUV presents a mixed reliability profile. The robust Vortec engines, particularly the inline-six, are generally well-regarded, though the V8's Active Fuel Management system can introduce costly issues. Transmission reliability is decent, but torque converter and solenoid problems are not uncommon. Suspension components like wheel bearings and air suspension (if equipped) can require attention. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or window regulators, are a recurring theme. Exterior issues like Midgate seal leaks are specific to the XUV's unique design. Interior components, such as the blower motor, can fail. Overall, while offering unique utility, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and budget accordingly for maintenance and potential repairs.
