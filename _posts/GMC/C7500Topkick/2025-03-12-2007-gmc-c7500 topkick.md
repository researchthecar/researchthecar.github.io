The 2007 GMC C7500 Topkick is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial use, offering a blend of utility and durability. Engine options included the Duramax 6.6L diesel, the Vortec 8.1L gasoline V8, and the Duramax 7.8L diesel. The Duramax 6.6L produced around 330 hp and 620 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options varied based on engine and application, with Allison automatics being common. Owners often appreciate the Topkick's towing capacity and robust build. Common complaints typically revolve around fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine), ride comfort due to its heavy-duty nature, and the cost of maintaining a commercial vehicle.
