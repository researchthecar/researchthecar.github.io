The 2005 GMC C7500 Topkick is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications like hauling, towing, and utility work. This vehicle offers robust performance and capability, making it a popular choice for businesses. Common engine options include the Duramax diesel engines, such as the 6.6L and the 8.1L Vortec gasoline engine. The Duramax 6.6L diesel engine typically produces around 300-330 horsepower and 520-650 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include Allison automatic transmissions, such as the Allison 1000. Owners often appreciate the Topkick's durability and workhorse capabilities. However, some common complaints include the higher cost of maintenance due to the commercial-grade components and the truck's size, which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces.
