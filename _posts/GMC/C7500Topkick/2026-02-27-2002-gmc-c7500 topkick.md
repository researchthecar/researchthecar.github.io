### Summary Verdict
The 2002 GMC C7500 Topkick, particularly with its diesel engine options, demonstrates a generally solid reliability profile expected of a commercial workhorse. However, specific components like the Caterpillar 3126B and Isuzu 6HK1-TCS engines can experience issues such as injector seal leaks, EGR cooler failures, and turbocharger problems, requiring attention and budget allocation for repairs. The Allison automatic transmissions are robust but can develop torque converter or valve body issues over time. Manual transmissions are generally reliable but subject to normal clutch wear and potential internal component wear. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can be prone to breakage under heavy loads. Electrical system issues often stem from corrosion in wiring harnesses, a common concern in older vehicles exposed to harsh conditions. Rust on the frame and body is a significant consideration, particularly in regions with salted roads. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of wear are crucial for maintaining the operational readiness and longevity of the C7500 Topkick.
