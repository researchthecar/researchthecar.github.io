Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2004 GMC C7500 Topkick, formatted for your website. This information is based on typical problems reported for vehicles of this type and age. Remember that individual vehicle condition varies greatly depending on usage and maintenance history.

The 2004 GMC C7500 Topkick is a medium-duty truck, designed for commercial applications. Engine options included the Duramax diesel engines and Vortec gasoline engines, as well as several Allison transmission options. Common feedback about the Topkick often revolves around its reliability and capability for heavy-duty work, while downsides frequently mentioned are the higher maintenance costs associated with commercial vehicles and the less refined ride compared to lighter-duty trucks. The 6.6L Duramax Diesel produced approximately 300-330 horsepower and 520-620 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific variant.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Diesel (LLY/LB7)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, white smoke from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy, and eventually engine misfires. Can be caused by contaminated fuel or normal wear and tear. LLY engines are more prone to this issue due to the injector design and location.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injectors. It's recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure even performance and prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, excessive white smoke on startup, and a rough idle until the engine warms up. Can trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty glow plug(s). It's often recommended to replace all glow plugs at the same time, especially if the vehicle has high mileage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, black smoke from the exhaust, whistling or whining noises from the turbocharger, and a check engine light. Can be caused by oil starvation, foreign object damage, or normal wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec Gas**
*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, coolant loss, and a check engine light. Coolant leaking into the engine oil can also occur, leading to engine damage if not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable decrease in oil level between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: This can be a complex issue. Potential solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or even a complete engine rebuild. The severity of the consumption dictates the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 Series**

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during TCC engagement, slipping during acceleration, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifting, or failure to shift into certain gears. Can trigger a transmission fault code.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Internal Seal Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid leaks, slipping, and reduced transmission performance. Can be difficult to diagnose the exact source of the leak without disassembling the transmission.
    *   Solution: Reseal the transmission. This may require a complete transmission overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging, uneven ride height, reduced load-carrying capacity, and potential cracking of the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, and reduced handling performance.
