The 2019 GMC Yukon XL is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong towing capability. Engine options include the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 6-speed or 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Yukon XL's ability to haul large families and cargo, as well as its relatively luxurious interior. However, common complaints include its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and occasionally reported issues with the automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2019 GMC Yukon XL can suffer from a variety of issues. The most concerning are related to the engine (AFM lifter failure, oil consumption) and transmission (rough shifting), as these can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins and suspension problems are also not uncommon. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite severe and result in significant repair bills. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
