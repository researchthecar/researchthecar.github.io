**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**
*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light. Often accompanied by diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to cylinder deactivation. The AFM/DFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but the lifters in this system can fail, leading to engine problems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft if it has been damaged. In some cases, AFM/DFM delete kits are installed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 GMC Yukon XL appears to have some potential issues primarily related to the engine (especially lifter failure in the V8 models), transmission shifting, and electrical components like the infotainment system. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences solvable with software updates to major repairs requiring engine or transmission work. The estimated cost to fix these issues can vary significantly, from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements or software updates to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission rebuilds or replacements. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect the vehicle and its service history before purchasing.
