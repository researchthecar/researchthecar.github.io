The 2023 GMC Yukon XL is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine options. The Yukon XL offers three engine choices: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Yukon XL for its ample cargo space, especially behind the third row, and its smooth ride quality, especially when equipped with the available Magnetic Ride Control suspension. Common complaints include its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, the high price point, and fuel economy concerns, particularly with the gasoline engines.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) / Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM/DFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. Lifter failure can occur due to various reasons, including oil starvation or mechanical issues. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder head. In some cases, disabling the AFM/DFM system may be considered.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) / Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, lifter failure can occur in the 6.2L engine. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder head. In some cases, disabling the AFM/DFM system may be considered.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs. This can be due to piston ring issues, valve seal leaks, or PCV system problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause. Potential solutions include replacing piston rings, valve seals, or repairing/replacing the PCV system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning fuel injectors can cause rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and excessive smoke.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty injector(s). Replacement of the affected fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ (depending on how many injectors need to be replaced)

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable harshness during gear changes, delays when shifting, and/or erratic shifting behavior. This can be caused by valve body issues, solenoid problems, or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify any error codes. Possible solutions include reprogramming the transmission control module (TCM), replacing the valve body, or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $6,000+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Malfunction (if equipped)**
