The 2022 GMC Yukon XL is a large SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capabilities. Engine options include a 5.3L V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), a 6.2L V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Yukon XL's luxurious features, ample cargo space, and smooth ride. However, some common complaints include the high price tag, large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and some reported issues with the infotainment system and electronic components.

**Summary**

The 2022 GMC Yukon XL can be a great vehicle, but it is not without potential issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine (particularly AFM/DFM lifter failures) and the transmission. The lifter issues can lead to significant engine damage, resulting in high repair costs. Transmission problems, while potentially less catastrophic, can still be expensive to fix. Electrical glitches are also common, especially with the infotainment system. While some issues can be resolved with software updates, others require parts replacement, adding to the overall cost of ownership. Before purchasing a used 2022 GMC Yukon XL, a thorough inspection is highly recommended, and checking the vehicle's service history for any reported issues is crucial.
