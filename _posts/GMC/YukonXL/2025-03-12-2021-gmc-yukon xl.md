The 2021 GMC Yukon XL is a full-size SUV offering a spacious interior, robust towing capability, and a comfortable ride. The 2021 model marked the start of the fifth generation, introducing a new independent rear suspension and updated styling. Engine options include the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), the 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and the 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I6 (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque).
