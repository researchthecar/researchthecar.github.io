The 2017 GMC Yukon XL is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine options, and comfortable ride. It offers a balance of capability and luxury, making it a popular choice for families and those needing to tow. Engine options include a 5.3L V8 (355 horsepower, 383 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L V8 (420 horsepower, 460 lb-ft of torque). The 5.3L V8 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.2L V8 is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Yukon XL's ample cargo space, smooth ride, and strong towing capacity. Common dislikes include its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, fuel economy, and some reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a common issue on GM engines with AFM. Symptoms include a misfire, rough running, and a check engine light. The AFM lifters collapse and cause the engine to run on fewer cylinders.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and sometimes the camshaft. Many owners choose to disable AFM altogether during the repair to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be related to the AFM system or piston ring issues. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may be present.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is key. AFM disablement, piston ring replacement, or valve stem seal replacement are potential solutions, depending on the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves (Direct Injection)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, which can cause rough idling, decreased performance, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Perform an intake valve cleaning service, such as walnut blasting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a common issue on GM engines with AFM. Symptoms include a misfire, rough running, and a check engine light. The AFM lifters collapse and cause the engine to run on fewer cylinders.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and sometimes the camshaft. Many owners choose to disable AFM altogether during the repair to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Paired with 5.3L V8)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh shifts, slipping between gears, and/or delayed engagement. Can be caused by valve body issues or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid/filter) to $3,000 - $5,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (Paired with 6.2L V8)**

*   **"Torque Converter Shudder"/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This transmission has a history of shuddering and harsh shifting, particularly at lower speeds. This is often described as feeling like driving over rumble strips. It's often linked to the torque converter and/or the transmission fluid itself.
    *   Solution: Some have success with multiple transmission fluid flushes using an updated fluid formula (often Dexron HP). In other cases, torque converter replacement is necessary. Valve body replacement may also be a fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (fluid flush) to $2,000 - $3,000+ (torque converter/valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with the Magnetic Ride Control suspension may experience failure of the shock absorbers. Symptoms include a bouncy or unstable ride, leaks from the shocks, and potentially error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed MRC shock absorbers. This can be an expensive repair due to the cost of the specialized parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per shock absorber (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the battery draining overnight or within a short period, even when the vehicle is off. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience freezing, crashing, or unresponsiveness.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. If that doesn't work, a software update or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) to $500 - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation can accumulate inside the headlight assemblies.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlight assembly and dry it out. Reseal the housing to prevent future condensation. In some cases, the headlight assembly may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (reseal) to $500 - $1,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or install a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100 (cover) to $1,000 - $2,000 (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 GMC Yukon XL can be a comfortable and capable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The most concerning issues revolve around engine problems (AFM lifter failure, oil consumption), and transmission problems (torque converter shudder/harsh shifting), which can be quite costly to repair. Electrical issues and suspension problems can also occur. While not all Yukon XLs will experience these problems, a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended, especially checking for signs of transmission issues or oil consumption.
