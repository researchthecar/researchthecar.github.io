**Summary**

The 2020 GMC Yukon XL, while generally a reliable vehicle, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant issues revolve around the engine's AFM/DFM system, which can lead to lifter failure, and the 10-speed transmission, which can experience harsh shifting.
