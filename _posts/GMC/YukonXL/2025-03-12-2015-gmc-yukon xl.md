The 2015 GMC Yukon XL is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capability, and comfortable ride. Engine options include the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft torque) and the 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft torque). Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (6L80). People appreciate the Yukon XL's ample cargo space, strong engine performance, and quiet cabin. Common complaints include the large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and the fuel economy of the V8 engines. The Magnetic Ride Control suspension is also a common point of failure in the vehicle.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. Lifter failure can cause misfires, rough running, and engine knocking. Often accompanied by a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters. It is highly recommended to replace all lifters and the lifter tray.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Higher than normal oil usage between oil changes. Can be caused by worn piston rings, valve seals, or AFM system issues.
    *   Solution: Perform an oil consumption test to determine the cause. Depending on the cause, solutions can range from replacing valve seals to replacing the piston rings or entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $7,000+ depending on the cause and severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Purge valve gets stuck open causing the vehicle to run lean.
    *   Solution: Replace the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, the AFM system can lead to lifter failure, causing misfires, rough running, and engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters. It is highly recommended to replace all lifters and the lifter tray.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+

    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifting, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Transmission may slip or shudder during acceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (reprogram) - $4,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibration or shudder felt at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration. Often caused by torque converter clutch failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid. In some cases, a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
