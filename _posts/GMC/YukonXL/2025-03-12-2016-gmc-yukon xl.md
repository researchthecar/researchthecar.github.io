The 2016 GMC Yukon XL is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and towing capability. It offers three engine options: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 producing 285 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque (although the V6 was primarily found in the standard Yukon, not the XL). The 5.3L and 6.2L engines are commonly paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission (8L90). The 4.3L is usually paired with a 6-speed automatic (6L80). Owners often praise the Yukon XL's ample cargo space and passenger room, especially in the third row, as well as its powerful engine options for towing. Common complaints include its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, lower-than-average fuel economy, and some reported issues with the infotainment system and transmission.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idle, engine misfires, and potential damage to the catalytic converter due to oil fouling. The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can lead to these issues over time.
    *   Solution: Disabling the AFM system with an aftermarket device or a custom tune can help prevent these problems. Replacing faulty AFM lifters is also a common repair. Replacing the PCV valve can also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ for AFM disabler or tune; $2,500 - $4,000+ for lifter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False low oil pressure readings on the dashboard gauge, potentially triggering warning lights. This is often due to a faulty sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, excessive oil consumption, rough idle, engine misfires, and catalytic converter damage can occur due to the AFM system.
    *   Solution: Disabling AFM via aftermarket device or tune. Replacing faulty AFM lifters. Replacing the PCV valve can also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ for AFM disabler or tune; $2,500 - $4,000+ for lifter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves (Direct Injection)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, reduced power, and poor fuel economy. Direct injection engines don't have fuel washing the intake valves, leading to carbon buildup.
    *   Solution: Performing an intake valve cleaning service (e.g., walnut blasting) to remove carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8L90 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/ "Chevy Shake"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, and during downshifts. Some owners report a shudder or vibration, especially at highway speeds, commonly referred to as the "Chevy Shake."
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and replacement with an updated fluid formulation is a common first step. Some cases may require valve body replacement or even full transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid flush; $800 - $1500+ for valve body replacement; $4,000 - $6,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, particularly under light acceleration. This can be caused by torque converter clutch issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, the air suspension warning light illuminating, and the compressor failing to inflate the air springs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (if equipped) Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking fluid from the shock absorbers, a bouncy or unstable ride, and the "Service Ride Control" message appearing on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty magnetic ride control shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500 per shock absorber.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The touchscreen freezing, becoming unresponsive, or glitching. Bluetooth connectivity problems and navigation system malfunctions are also reported.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, the infotainment system module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,200+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery draining overnight or after short periods of inactivity. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Issues (Power Liftgate)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate failing to open or close properly, or making unusual noises during operation. This can be caused by a faulty motor, struts, or latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty liftgate motor, struts, or latch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or splitting of the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard (expensive and labor-intensive) or using a dashboard cover to conceal the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (dashboard replacement), $50 - $200 (dashboard cover)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 GMC Yukon XL, while a spacious and capable SUV, is prone to several issues. Engine problems, particularly related to AFM in the V8 engines, can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, especially with the 8L90 transmission, are also common and can range from relatively inexpensive fluid flushes to major overhauls. Electrical glitches, such as infotainment system failures, and interior issues like cracked dashboards, are also common complaints. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the cost of potential repairs when considering this vehicle.
