The 2004 GMC C8500 Topkick is a medium-duty truck designed for various commercial applications. Engine options include the Duramax 6.6L diesel (rated at 300-330 hp and 520-620 lb-ft of torque depending on the year and tune), the 8.1L Vortec gasoline V8, and Caterpillar diesel engines. Transmission options include Allison automatics and manual transmissions. Owners often appreciate the truck's robust build, towing capacity, and reliability in demanding work environments. Common dislikes include fuel consumption, ride harshness, and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Diesel (LLY)**

*   **Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Elevated coolant temperatures, steam from the engine bay, coolant loss. Can be caused by a restricted radiator, faulty thermostat, or failing water pump. The LLY is especially prone to overheating due to its design that restricts airflow across the engine.
    *   Solution: Flush and clean the cooling system, replace the thermostat, replace the water pump, or install a performance radiator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause and extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, white smoke from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy, and potential engine knocking. The LLY injectors are known to fail.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors. Recoding the new injectors is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per injector, plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Filter Restriction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, stalling, or difficulty starting. The fuel filter can become clogged by contaminants, restricting fuel flow to the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the fuel filter with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec Gasoline V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level, blue smoke from the exhaust, and oil fouling of spark plugs. The 8.1L is known to consume oil, especially at higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and add oil as needed. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 (topping off oil) - $5,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, especially when cold. Loss of power. Broken manifold bolts.
    *   Solution: Replace exhaust manifold gaskets and potentially the exhaust manifolds themselves. Repair any broken exhaust manifold bolts or studs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found
