**Summary**

The 2002 GMC Yukon XL 2500, while a capable and spacious vehicle, is prone to several age-related issues. Engine problems such as intake manifold leaks and exhaust manifold bolt breakage can be costly to repair, particularly with the 8.1L engine. Transmission issues like harsh shifting and torque converter failure are also common. Suspension components such as ball joints and leaf springs may require replacement due to wear and tear. Electrical issues with the instrument cluster and blower motor resistor are also potential concerns. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like rust repair and transmission work, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
