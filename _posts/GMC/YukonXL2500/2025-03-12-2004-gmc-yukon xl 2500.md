The 2004 GMC Yukon XL 2500 is a heavy-duty, full-size SUV known for its towing capacity and spacious interior. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (producing around 325 hp and 360 lb-ft of torque) and the 8.1L Vortec V8 (producing around 320 hp and 440 lb-ft of torque). A common transmission found in this model year is the 4L80E 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Yukon XL 2500 for its ruggedness, ability to haul large loads, and comfortable ride for passengers. Some common complaints revolve around fuel economy (particularly with the 8.1L engine), some electrical issues, and wear and tear associated with an older vehicle.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual increase in oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. May be accompanied by blueish smoke from the exhaust pipe.
    *   Solution: Replacing valve stem seals can sometimes mitigate the issue if caught early. Piston ring replacement may be necessary in more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of repairs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knock Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminating with knock sensor codes (P0325, P0330). Reduced engine performance and fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty knock sensor(s). It's often recommended to replace both sensors simultaneously, as they are located in a similar area and prone to failure around the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or exhaust leak noise, especially when the engine is cold. Reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Removal of broken bolts and replacement with new manifold bolts. May require exhaust manifold replacement if warped.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L80E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Soft or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delays or "slipping" between gears, especially when shifting from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, valve body rebuild or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, or unusual noises coming from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end of the vehicle sitting lower than the front, reduced load-carrying capacity, and potential for bottoming out.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, clunking noises when going over bumps, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning (speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge), dim or non-functional backlighting.
    *   Solution: Instrument cluster repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks not working intermittently or failing completely.
    *   Solution: Door lock actuator replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the lower body panels, particularly in areas exposed to road salt and moisture.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, patching, and repainting. In severe cases, panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ (depending on severity).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding/Yellowing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced headlight visibility due to oxidation and UV damage to the plastic headlight lenses.
    *   Solution: Headlight lens restoration (polishing) or headlight assembly replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: HVAC blower motor only working on certain speeds or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+

    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 GMC Yukon XL 2500, while a capable and comfortable vehicle, is prone to certain issues related to its age and heavy-duty nature. Engine issues, such as oil consumption and exhaust manifold bolt breakage (particularly on the 8.1L), can be costly to repair. Transmission problems like soft shifting and torque converter failure are also common concerns. Suspension and electrical issues, while generally less expensive, can still add to the overall cost of ownership. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. While many of these issues are relatively minor, the potential for more expensive repairs like engine or transmission overhauls should be considered when evaluating a used 2004 GMC Yukon XL 2500.
