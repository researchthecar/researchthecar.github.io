### Summary Verdict
The 2003 GMC Yukon XL 2500 is a capable and durable vehicle, particularly for those needing substantial hauling and passenger capacity. While its core mechanical components are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues with the 5.3L V8's AFM system, transmission wear (especially the 4L60-E), and common suspension wear items like ball joints. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and alternator failures are also noted. Proactive maintenance, especially fluid changes for the transmission and monitoring for coolant/oil leaks, can mitigate many of these potential problems. Despite these points, it remains a solid choice for its intended purpose when properly maintained.
