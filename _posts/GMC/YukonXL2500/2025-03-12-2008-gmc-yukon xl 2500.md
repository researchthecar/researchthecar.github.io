The 2008 GMC Yukon XL 2500 is a heavy-duty, full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine options, and towing capacity. This model year offered two engine choices: a 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 352 hp and 382 lb-ft of torque, and a massive 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 366 hp and 375 lb-ft of torque. These engines are mated to the 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Yukon XL 2500 for its ability to comfortably transport large families and cargo while towing heavy loads. Common criticisms include lower fuel economy due to its size and the age-related issues typical of vehicles from this era.
