### Summary Verdict
The 2007 GMC Yukon XL 2500 is a generally reliable heavy-duty SUV, particularly in its powertrain components when properly maintained. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in both V8 engines, which can lead to oil consumption and internal engine wear if not addressed. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter and potential overheating, are also noted. Electrical gremlins related to the Body Control Module and premature alternator failure are other areas to be aware of. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear over time, especially given the vehicle's weight and intended use. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these potential issues warrant attention for prospective buyers and current owners.
