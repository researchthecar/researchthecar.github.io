The 2001 GMC Yukon XL 2500 is a heavy-duty, full-size SUV known for its towing capacity and spacious interior. Engine options include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (rated around 300 hp and 360 lb-ft of torque) and the larger 8.1L Vortec V8 (rated around 340 hp and 455 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were typically paired with a 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Yukon XL 2500 for its durability and ability to haul large loads, but common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, age-related wear and tear, and the cost of maintaining a large vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2001 GMC Yukon XL 2500 can be a reliable workhorse, but age-related issues are common. Engine problems like intake manifold leaks (6.0L) and exhaust manifold bolt failures (8.1L) are frequent and can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the 4L80E can also be significant. Suspension wear, electrical gremlins, and rust are typical concerns. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, especially transmission work. Prospective buyers should have the vehicle thoroughly inspected, paying particular attention to the drivetrain, suspension, and rust, before making a purchase.
