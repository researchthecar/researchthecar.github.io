Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2024 GMC Sierra 3500 HD, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options. This information is compiled from owner forums, technical service bulletins (TSBs), and recall data.

The 2024 GMC Sierra 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and luxurious features in higher trim levels. Available engine options include the 6.6L gasoline V8 engine producing 401 horsepower and 464 lb-ft of torque, and the formidable 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8 engine, generating 470 horsepower and 975 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an Allison 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the truck's towing capacity, comfortable ride (especially with available adaptive ride control), and updated interior design. Common dislikes include the truck's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, fuel economy (especially with the diesel engine during city driving), and the high price point of higher trim levels.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Turbodiesel V8**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough idling, misfires, and decreased fuel economy. Diagnosis often points to faulty fuel injectors causing improper fuel delivery.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected fuel injectors is generally required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Bosch CP4 high-pressure fuel pump, used in some Duramax engines, has been known to fail, potentially causing catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include difficulty starting, a no-start condition, and metal shavings in the fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CP4 pump and thorough cleaning of the fuel system to remove metal debris. Some owners choose to upgrade to a more robust CP3 pump to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether an upgraded fuel pump is installed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Gasoline V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, can lead to lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking noise from the engine, misfires, and a loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty lifters and potentially the camshaft. Disabling the AFM system is a common preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and labor costs)
        *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 10-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation when shifting gears is also mentioned.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes resolve this issue. In other cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for software update; $800 - $2,000+ for valve body replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **"Service Ride Control" Message**
    *   Description/Symptoms: For trucks equipped with the optional adaptive ride control suspension, some owners have reported receiving a "Service Ride Control" message on the dashboard. This indicates a potential issue with the electronic dampers or related sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty dampers or sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on the specific component and labor costs)
     * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealer are often the first step. In more severe cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates; $500 - $1,500+ for infotainment unit replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of sporadic malfunctions with various sensors, including those related to blind spot monitoring, parking assist, and lane departure warning. These malfunctions often trigger warning lights on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Diagnostics to identify the specific faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor (depending on the type of sensor and labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found
