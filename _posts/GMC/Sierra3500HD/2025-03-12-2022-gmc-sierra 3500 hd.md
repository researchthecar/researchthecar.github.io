Here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 GMC Sierra 3500 HD, categorized by major component. This information is compiled from owner forums, NHTSA complaints, and professional mechanic insights.

The 2022 GMC Sierra 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and available technology. Engine options include the 6.6L L5P Duramax Diesel V8 (445 hp, 910 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.6L L8T Gasoline V8 (401 hp, 464 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with an Allison 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the truck's towing capacity, comfortable interior (especially in higher trims), and available technology features. Common complaints revolve around certain build quality issues, occasional electronic glitches, and the overall size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**6.6L L5P Duramax Diesel V8**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, black smoke from exhaust, and eventually a check engine light. Often affects injectors on one bank of the engine initially.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). Recalibration of the ECM may be required. It is often recommended to replace all injectors on the affected bank to ensure even performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per injector (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, metallic debris in the fuel system, and eventual engine failure. The CP4 pump is known to be less tolerant of contaminated fuel compared to previous designs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the entire fuel system (pump, injectors, fuel lines, etc.) is usually required due to contamination. Some owners opt for a CP3 conversion (installing an older, more robust CP3 pump).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ for complete fuel system replacement. $3,000 - $5,000 for CP3 conversion (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L L8T Gasoline V8**

*   **Valve Train Noise (Lifter Tick)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or tapping sound coming from the engine, especially when cold. It may diminish or disappear as the engine warms up.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the noise is considered normal. However, excessive noise may indicate a faulty lifter or rocker arm. Replacement of the affected components is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the repair and number of components replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 10-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears. Transmission may slip or hesitate when accelerating.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission overhaul may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for software reflash. $800 - $2000+ for valve body replacement. $3,000 - $7,000+ for transmission overhaul or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A vibration or shudder felt during light acceleration, especially at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: A fluid change with the updated Allison Transynd fluid or replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 for fluid change. $1,500 - $3,000 for torque converter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    * Solution: Applying grease to the leaf spring bushings and contact points. Replacement of worn bushings may be required in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for greasing/lubrication. $300 - $800+ for bushing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (screen) freezes, becomes unresponsive, or randomly reboots.
    *   Solution: Performing a hard reset of the system. Software updates may also address the issue. In some cases, the infotainment module itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) to $500 - $1500+ (module replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (TPMS, ABS, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights illuminate on the dashboard indicating a sensor malfunction (e.g., tire pressure monitoring system, anti-lock braking system).
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific sensor that is failing and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor (depending on the sensor and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Chrome Trim Peeling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Chrome trim pieces (e.g., around windows, bumpers, or grille) begin to peel or flake.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per piece (depending on the size and location).
    *   Recalls: None Found
