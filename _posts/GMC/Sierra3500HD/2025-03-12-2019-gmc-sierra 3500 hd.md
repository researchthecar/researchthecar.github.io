Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 GMC Sierra 3500 HD, categorized and detailed as requested.

The 2019 GMC Sierra 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (445 hp, 910 lb-ft of torque). The 6.0L gas engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.6L diesel uses an Allison 1000 6-speed automatic. People often praise the Sierra 3500 HD for its robust performance, comfortable ride (for a heavy-duty truck), and available technology. Common dislikes include its dated interior design (compared to rivals) and some reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 (L96)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, reduced power, and potential engine damage. Often occurs due to lifter collapse. Can cause damage to the camshaft as well.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty lifters, camshaft, and potentially other damaged components. Disabling AFM may prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs. This can lead to fouled spark plugs, catalytic converter damage, and eventual engine failure.
    * Solution: There are several options including replacing valve seals or piston rings. Some have used engine oil additives. Replacing the short block will typically be the only option to fully fix the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (L5P)**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Service DEF System" message, reduced engine power, and potential limp mode. Issues can stem from faulty DEF sensors, DEF pump failure, or clogged DEF injector.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component failure (sensor, pump, injector) and replace accordingly. Ensure proper DEF fluid quality.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, reduced power, excessive smoke, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injector(s). Ensure proper fuel filtration to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic (Diesel Models)**

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Shudder/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during TCC engagement, especially at highway speeds. Can eventually lead to complete TCC failure.
    *   Solution: Flush the transmission fluid. If the shudder is persistent, the torque converter will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or erratic shifts, slipping between gears, or a sudden increase in RPMs during shifts.
    *   Solution: Valve body issues are common with this transmission. Replacing or rebuilding the valve body can solve the problem. In more severe cases, the entire transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6L90 6-Speed Automatic (Gas Models)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Sometimes, a transmission fluid flush and software update can help. In other cases, valve body repair or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load capacity, and potential for leaf spring breakage. This is more common in trucks that are frequently used for heavy hauling or towing.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs with new or upgraded units. Adding helper springs or airbags can help prevent future sagging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front End Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of ball joints, tie rod ends, and other front-end components, leading to loose steering and potential alignment issues. This is often exacerbated by heavy use and rough road conditions.
    *   Solution: Replace worn components as needed. Regular inspection and maintenance can help prevent premature wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes intermittently.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset can sometimes resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a software update or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensor failures, including issues with the mass airflow sensor (MAF), oxygen sensors, or wheel speed sensors. This can lead to engine performance issues, warning lights, and potential safety concerns.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 GMC Sierra 3500 HD can suffer from a variety of issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical glitches to more significant engine and transmission problems. The diesel engine, while powerful, is prone to expensive DEF system and fuel injector issues. The gas engine is less prone to catastrophic failures but can suffer from oil consumption and AFM lifter issues. The transmission issues, especially the torque converter shudder on the Allison, are concerning. While not all trucks will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and factor in potential repair costs when considering this model. Many of the repairs can be costly, so budgeting for these potential repairs is a smart choice.
