The 2017 GMC Sierra 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (gas) and the 6.6L Duramax V8 (diesel). The 6.0L V8 produced 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque and the 6.6L Duramax V8 produced 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with the Allison 1000 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sierra 3500 HD for its powerful engine options, comfortable ride (for a heavy-duty truck), and well-appointed interior (on higher trim levels). Some common complaints include the truck's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces and the relatively high fuel consumption, especially with the diesel engine.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax V8 (L5P)**

* **CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine suddenly stalls or doesn't start, especially when cold. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel pressure or fuel rail pressure may be present. Can introduce metal shavings throughout the fuel system.
    * Solution: Replacement of the CP4 pump, fuel injectors, fuel lines, and fuel rails. The fuel tank may also need to be cleaned.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: "Service DEF System See Dealer" message, reduced engine power, difficulty starting, or failure to start. Can be caused by a faulty DEF injector, DEF pump, DEF level sensor, or clogged DEF filter.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the specific component causing the issue. Replacement of the faulty DEF injector, pump, sensor, or filter. In some cases, a software update may resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the failed component.
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Vortec V8 (LC8)**

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, ticking or knocking noises from the engine, reduced power, and potential engine damage. AFM lifters can collapse, leading to damage to the camshaft and other engine components.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failed AFM lifters, camshaft, and potentially other damaged engine components. AFM delete kits are sometimes installed as a more permanent solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable oil consumption between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and possible fouling of spark plugs. Can be caused by worn valve stem seals or piston rings.
    * Solution: Replacement of valve stem seals or piston rings. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, especially at highway speeds, when the torque converter clutch engages.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission flush and fluid change with a specific fluid designed to reduce shudder may provide temporary relief.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift. Can be caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of the issue. Repair or replacement of the valve body, clutch packs, or complete transmission overhaul.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front End Noise/Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Popping, clunking or squeaking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Premature wear of ball joints, tie rod ends, and other suspension components.
    * Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn or damaged suspension components, such as ball joints, tie rod ends, sway bar links, and shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the components that need replacing.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Radio/Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frozen screen, intermittent operation, Bluetooth connectivity problems, failure of touchscreen functions, or complete radio failure.
    * Solution: Software update to the infotainment system. In some cases, replacement of the radio/infotainment unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ depending on the cause and solution.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a few days, requiring frequent jump starts. Can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component, a faulty alternator, or a failing battery.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the parasitic draw, replacement of the faulty component, replacement of the alternator, or replacement of the battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Seat Heater Failure**

**Summary**

The 2017 GMC Sierra 3500 HD can be a reliable and capable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues reported. The most concerning issues relate to the Duramax diesel engine's CP4 fuel pump and the gas engine's AFM lifters, both of which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues and front-end suspension problems are also relatively common. While not every truck will experience these issues, a thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
