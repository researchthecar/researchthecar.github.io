The 2010 GMC Sierra 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (gas), the 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8, and a CNG option. The 6.0L gas engine produces around 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, while the 6.6L Duramax diesel delivers approximately 365 horsepower and 660 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic for both the gas and diesel engines. Owners often praise the Sierra 3500 HD for its robust build, powerful engines, and comfortable ride (for a heavy-duty truck). Common complaints typically revolve around fuel economy (especially with the diesel), some reported electrical issues, and the cost of maintenance and repairs, particularly for the diesel engine.

**Summary**

The 2010 GMC Sierra 3500 HD is a capable work truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The 6.6L Duramax diesel engine, while powerful, can be expensive to maintain due to potential fuel injector, EGR cooler, and turbocharger problems. The gas engines also have their own quirks, such as oil consumption and exhaust manifold bolt issues. Transmission issues can occur with both the Allison and Hydra-Matic transmissions, potentially leading to costly repairs. Suspension and electrical problems are also common complaints. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, and the costs can vary significantly depending on the specific problem and the shop performing the work. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended.
