**Summary**

The 2008 GMC Sierra 3500 HD has several common issues, particularly relating to the diesel engine (fuel injectors, EGR cooler, turbocharger) and Allison transmission (torque converter, valve body).  Gasoline engines may experience oil consumption and exhaust manifold bolt failures. Suspension components are also prone to wear due to the truck's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues with the instrument cluster and BCM are also noted. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely, with some repairs being relatively inexpensive while others can be quite costly, especially those related to the diesel engine and transmission. Buyers should carefully inspect the truck for these issues and factor potential repair costs into their purchasing decision.
