The 2012 GMC Sierra 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing capacity and workhorse capabilities. It offers a comfortable ride for a heavy-duty truck and a relatively quiet cabin. However, some owners have reported issues. Available engine options include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (397 hp, 765 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options are the 6-speed Allison automatic for the Duramax diesel and a 6-speed Hydra-Matic automatic for the gasoline engine. Some common complaints involve maintenance costs typical of heavy-duty trucks and occasional issues with specific components.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, sometimes noticed between oil changes. May result in low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels frequently and topping off as needed is a common practice. Some owners have reported success with switching to a different viscosity oil. More extreme cases may require engine repairs such as replacing valve stem seals or piston rings, but this is less common.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise coming from the engine, misfires, rough running. Often caused by worn or damaged lifters.
    * Solution: Replacement of failed lifters, often recommended to replace all lifters on the affected bank of cylinders. May also require camshaft replacement if damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (LML)**
*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, white or black smoke from the exhaust, reduced fuel economy, and potential for engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed fuel injector(s). It is often recommended to replace all injectors on that bank or even all eight for preventive maintenance, given the labor involved.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $5,000+ (depending on number of injectors replaced and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine not starting, stalling, loss of power, metal shavings found in the fuel system. This generation Duramax uses the CP4 pump, which is known to be less robust than previous CP3 pumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CP4 pump and thorough cleaning of the entire fuel system to remove metal debris. Sometimes, a CP3 conversion kit is installed for improved reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $10,000+ (depending on damage and if converting to a CP3 pump)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, poor fuel economy, the "check engine" light illuminating. DPF can become clogged.
    *   Solution: Performing a forced regeneration of the DPF, cleaning the DPF, or replacing the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+ (depending on the solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased engine performance, the "check engine" light coming on.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic (Diesel)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, slipping, especially under heavy load. May trigger transmission-related diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a rebuild of the entire transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, getting stuck in a gear, or inability to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Hydra-Matic 6L90 6-Speed Automatic (Gas)**
* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, slipping, especially under heavy load. May trigger transmission-related diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs).
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a rebuild of the entire transmission may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or inconsistent performance.
    * Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Wear (Ball Joints, Tie Rods)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, wandering, clunking noises from the front end, uneven tire wear. Common issue due to the weight of the vehicle and heavy use.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends. Alignment is necessary after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sag (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load capacity, poor ride quality. Common in trucks that frequently tow or haul heavy loads.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs or addition of helper springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 GMC Sierra 3500 HD is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the Duramax diesel engine, specifically fuel injector and CP4 pump failures, which can be expensive to repair. Other common issues like front end wear and rust are typical for a heavy-duty truck of this age. The severity of these issues varies, but proactive maintenance can help mitigate some risks. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousands for major engine or transmission work.
