The 2004 GMC Canyon marked the introduction of a mid-size pickup truck from General Motors, aiming to provide a more manageable and fuel-efficient alternative to full-size trucks. While offering utility and a decent driving experience, it has its share of common problems reported by owners. Engine options included a 2.8L inline-4 producing 175 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L inline-5 generating 220 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally liked the Canyon's maneuverability and fuel economy compared to larger trucks. Common dislikes include some cheap interior materials, and a few recurring mechanical issues.

**Summary**

The 2004 GMC Canyon has several common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, such as cylinder head cracking in the 2.8L and camshaft actuator failure in the 3.5L, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, can also be expensive to address. Suspension and electrical problems can also occur, potentially adding to the ownership costs. Rust issues are also a concern, particularly in areas with road salt. Overall, while the Canyon offers some benefits as a mid-size truck, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and be prepared for potential repairs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly, but some issues can be expected with a vehicle of this age.
