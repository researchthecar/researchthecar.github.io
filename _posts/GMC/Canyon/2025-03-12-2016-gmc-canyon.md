The 2016 GMC Canyon is a mid-size pickup truck that offered a blend of practicality and comfort. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-4 (200 hp, 191 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L V6 (305 hp, 269 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.8L Duramax diesel (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). The transmissions available were a 6-speed automatic for the inline-4 and V6 engines and also available for the diesel engine later in the model year. The 2016 GMC Canyon was generally liked for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency (especially the diesel), and comfortable interior relative to other trucks in its class. Some common complaints included the infotainment system (sluggish response), transmission issues, and the overall reliability of certain components.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Repair generally consists of replacing the valve cover and cleaning the PCV system. Sometimes piston ring replacement is necessary if the problem is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the timing chain, leading to engine noise (rattling), check engine light, and potential engine damage. This is often linked to oil quality and maintenance intervals.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and possibly the sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the DEF system including sensor failures, injector problems, and crystallization. This can cause warning lights, reduced engine power, and failure to start.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of faulty sensors, injectors, or DEF pump. Cleaning the DEF injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, and delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software reflash/update of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reflash) - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking, popping, or creaking noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. This is often attributed to worn ball joints or control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected ball joints or control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system can freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate controls.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve some issues. Replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (update) - $800+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of batteries dying prematurely, causing the vehicle to not start or require frequent jump-starts.
    * Solution: Common causes include parasitic draws (e.g., from aftermarket accessories or faulty modules), a bad alternator, or a defective battery. Diagnosing and addressing the source of the drain is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (battery replacement) - $500+ (diagnosing and fixing parasitic draw)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2016 GMC Canyon presents a mix of moderate and potentially serious issues. The 3.6L V6 engine's oil consumption and timing chain issues, as well as transmission problems across all engine options, are the most concerning due to the potential for high repair costs and engine damage. Electrical issues with the infotainment system are a nuisance. Owners should pay close attention to oil levels, transmission performance, and any unusual noises from the engine or suspension. Addressing these issues promptly can help prevent more costly repairs down the line.
