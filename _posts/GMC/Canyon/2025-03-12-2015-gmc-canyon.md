The 2015 GMC Canyon marked the return of the mid-size pickup truck to GMC's lineup. It was available with three engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 200 hp and 191 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 producing 305 hp and 269 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel inline-4 producing 181 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L I4 and 3.6L V6 engines were paired with either a 6-speed manual (very rare) or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.8L Duramax diesel was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Canyon for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency (compared to full-size trucks), and comfortable interior. Common complaints included transmission issues (especially rough shifting), some electrical problems, and premature wear on certain components.

**Summary**

The 2015 GMC Canyon, while a generally well-regarded mid-size truck, does exhibit several common issues. Engine problems, especially timing chain issues in the V6 and DEF problems in the diesel, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues like harsh shifting are prevalent and may require significant investment to resolve. Electrical problems, while less common, can also be frustrating. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, especially if considering a higher-mileage example. A thorough inspection and pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage.
