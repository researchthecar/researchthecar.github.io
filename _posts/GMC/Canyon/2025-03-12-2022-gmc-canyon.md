The 2022 GMC Canyon is a mid-size pickup truck offering a blend of capability and comfort. It came with three available engines: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 200 hp and 191 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 generating 308 hp and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel inline-4 producing 181 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L and 3.6L engine options were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Canyon's maneuverability, comfortable ride, and available advanced safety features. Common dislikes include the dated interior design, smaller rear seat space in the extended cab models, and lower fuel economy for the V6 compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

No Issues Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Check Engine Light/ Misfire Due to Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, often accompanied by a noticeable engine misfire, rough idle, and a possible decrease in fuel economy. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel injector performance may be present (e.g., P0300-Random Misfire Detected, P0201-P0206 - Injector Circuit Malfunction).
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm the faulty injector. Replacement of the affected fuel injector(s) is required. In some cases, cleaning the fuel injectors might temporarily alleviate the issue but replacement is the long-term solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Valve Issues/Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noises from the engine, rough idle, loss of power, and check engine light illumination are the common symptoms. It is usually lifter failure causing damage to the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm the valve or lifter issue. Replacement of affected valve(s) and/or lifter(s). In severe cases, camshaft replacement is also necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $5000+ (depending on the extent of damage and parts needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights related to the DEF system illuminate, indicating problems with the DEF level, DEF quality, or a malfunctioning DEF injector. Reduced engine power or speed limitation can occur if the system detects an issue.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the specific problem within the DEF system. This could involve refilling the DEF tank with high-quality fluid, replacing a faulty DEF injector, or addressing issues with the DEF heater or sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the specific component needing repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.5L and 3.6L Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, noticeable hesitation when accelerating, and/or a "clunking" sound during gear changes are common complaints. This issue can be more pronounced at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or even a full transmission rebuild may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software reflash) - $4000+ (for transmission rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.8L Duramax Diesel Engine)**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of ball joints, tie rod ends, and/or control arm bushings. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and/or loose or vague steering.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the front suspension components to identify worn parts. Replacement of worn ball joints, tie rod ends, and/or control arm bushings. Wheel alignment is also recommended after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of components replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or exhibits glitches such as distorted graphics or intermittent audio. Connectivity issues with Bluetooth or Apple CarPlay/Android Auto may also occur.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset (if possible). Updating the infotainment system software. In some cases, the infotainment system module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1000+ (for module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Backup Camera Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera image is distorted, shows no image, or experiences intermittent functionality. The camera lens may also become cloudy or obscured.
    *   Solution: Inspect the camera lens for damage or obstructions. Check the wiring connections to the camera. If the camera is faulty, replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cost of the replacement camera and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or warping of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight. This is most commonly noticed on the top of the dashboard near the windshield.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement, or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on whether a cover or full replacement is chosen, and labor costs)

**Summary**

The 2022 GMC Canyon can be a reliable truck, but it's essential to be aware of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the 3.6L V6 engine and the 8-speed automatic transmission, with potential for costly repairs. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and exterior issues like backup camera failure are also worth noting. Overall, while there aren't widespread, catastrophic failures, it's advisable to have a thorough pre-purchase inspection performed, particularly checking the transmission shifting and listening for unusual engine noises, to mitigate potential repair expenses down the road.
