Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 GMC Canyon, organized by category and powertrain configuration, formatted for your website.

The 2019 GMC Canyon is a mid-size pickup truck known for its maneuverability, comfortable ride, and available features. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 200 horsepower and 191 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 generating 308 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Duramax turbodiesel inline-4 making 181 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque.

Owners often praise the Canyon's fuel economy (particularly with the diesel), its easy-to-park size, and its strong towing capability when properly equipped. Common complaints include the dated interior design, occasionally rough transmission shifting, and some reported reliability concerns.

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, rough idle, misfires, potential for engine damage. Some reports indicate issues with the valve lifters.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters, and potentially the camshaft if damage is present.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+ depending on the extent of the damage.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component requiring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbodiesel Inline-4**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, DEF system warning messages, reduced engine power, potential for the vehicle to enter limp mode. Issues can arise from faulty DEF sensors, DEF pump failures, or clogged DEF injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific DEF system component causing the problem and replace it. This could involve replacing sensors, the DEF pump, or cleaning/replacing DEF injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+ depending on the component requiring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather, check engine light illuminated, potential for rough idling. Faulty glow plugs can prevent proper combustion during cold starts.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. Some owners have reported a "clunking" sensation during shifts. The 8L45 and 8L90 transmissions in GM vehicles of this era have been known to have issues.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with the updated Mobil Delvac 1 ATF can sometimes help. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or full transmission replacement might be required.

**Summary**

The 2019 GMC Canyon presents a mix of potential issues. The most concerning are the potential for lifter failure in the 3.6L V6 and DEF system issues in the 2.8L Duramax, both of which can be expensive to repair. The 8-speed transmission can also exhibit harsh shifting, which may require costly repairs. Electrical problems, like infotainment glitches and battery drain, are less severe but can still be frustrating. Prospective buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, review its maintenance history, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, particularly if considering a Canyon with the 3.6L V6 or 2.8L Duramax engine.
