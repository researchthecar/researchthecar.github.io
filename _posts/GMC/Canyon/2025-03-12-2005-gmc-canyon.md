The 2005 GMC Canyon marked the beginning of the Canyon's production run and offered a smaller, more fuel-efficient alternative to the full-size Sierra pickup. Available engine options included a 2.8L Inline-4 producing 175 hp and 185 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5L Inline-5 producing 220 hp and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Canyon's maneuverability and fuel economy, but some common complaints include uncomfortable seats, and certain mechanical issues that surface as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**2.8L Inline-4**

*   **Cylinder Head Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss without visible leaks, overheating, white smoke from the exhaust (indicating coolant burning in the cylinders).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, vacuum leak, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L Inline-5**

*   **Cylinder Head Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.8L, coolant loss, overheating, white smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Actuator Solenoid Failure**

**Summary:**

The 2005 GMC Canyon, while generally a reliable truck, is prone to several common issues as it ages. Engine issues such as cylinder head cracking can be expensive to repair. Transmission problems with the 4L60-E are also common and costly. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also susceptible to wear and tear. Electrical issues, especially with the instrument cluster and BCM, can be frustrating. While the Canyon offers a more compact and fuel-efficient option compared to full-size trucks, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs when considering a used 2005 model.
