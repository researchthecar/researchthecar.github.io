The 2023 GMC Canyon represents a significant redesign for the mid-size pickup, boasting a more rugged and refined appeal. It's generally praised for its improved off-road capability, updated interior, and more powerful standard engine. However, like any new model year, it's not without its reported issues. The 2023 Canyon comes standard with a turbocharged 2.7L inline-4 engine, offered in three output variants: 237 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque (base Elevation trim, later discontinued), 310 hp and 390 lb-ft of torque (most trims), and 310 hp and 430 lb-ft of torque (High Output). All trims come paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Common dislikes include the higher price point compared to previous generations and some perceived cost-cutting measures in certain interior materials.

**Engine**

**2.7L Turbo High-Output (L3B) - 310 hp / 430 lb-ft**

*   **Excessive Crankcase Pressure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive crankcase pressure causing the rear main seal to leak. Symptoms include oil drips under the vehicle near the transmission bell housing, and potential for oil to contaminate the flywheel/clutch area.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear main seal is the common fix, though addressing the root cause of the excessive crankcase pressure is critical. Check PCV system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of engine misfires and rough running conditions are not uncommon. This can be related to spark plugs, coil packs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to isolate the cause of the misfire. Replacing faulty spark plugs, coil packs, or fuel injectors. Software update.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L45E)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh shifts, particularly during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation when shifting between gears, especially when downshifting.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer may resolve some shifting issues. A transmission fluid flush and filter change. In severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint is a noticeable squeaking noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect the leaf springs and bushings. Applying grease to the leaf springs or replacing worn bushings may alleviate the squeaking. Some owners have had success with aftermarket leaf spring isolators.

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of malfunctioning sensors, including but not limited to: tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensors, blind spot monitoring sensors, and parking sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor(s) using a diagnostic scan tool. Replacing the defective sensor(s) and recalibrating the system if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ per sensor

**Summary**

The 2023 GMC Canyon, while representing a significant upgrade in many areas, is experiencing its share of early-model issues. Engine issues, transmission concerns, electrical glitches, and suspension noises are among the most frequently reported problems. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely, ranging from relatively inexpensive fixes like sensor replacements to potentially costly repairs such as engine or transmission work. The high output engine is new and likely to have these issues while kinks are being worked out. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any prospective purchase.
