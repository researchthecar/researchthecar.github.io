### Summary Verdict
The 2022 GMC Canyon demonstrates solid reliability, especially with its gasoline engines (2.5L and 3.6L V6) and automatic transmissions. The primary area of concern for potential buyers is the 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel engine, which can experience issues related to Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) regeneration and the Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) system. These are common to many modern diesel powertrains and often require specific driving habits or maintenance to mitigate. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted but do not appear to be widespread critical failures. Overall, the Canyon is a dependable choice, with the diesel variant requiring a bit more attention to its emissions control systems.
