### Summary Verdict
The 2012 GMC Canyon generally exhibits good mechanical reliability, particularly with its powertrain options. The inline-4 and inline-5 engines, along with the available automatic and manual transmissions, are not typically associated with widespread, significant failures. However, owners should be aware of potential issues in the electrical system, such as alternator failures, which can lead to a complete loss of power. Exterior components like the tailgate latch and interior systems like the HVAC blower motor have also seen some reports of failure. While these issues are not endemic, they represent the most common non-wear-related problems reported for this model year. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of these issues can help maintain the Canyon's overall dependability.
