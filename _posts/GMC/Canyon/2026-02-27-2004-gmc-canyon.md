### Summary Verdict
The 2004 GMC Canyon presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly with the 3.5L engine's timing chain and the automatic transmission's tendency for slipping or torque converter problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can also wear prematurely. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, and exterior concerns like rust are also noted. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential repair areas and budget accordingly for maintenance and unexpected repairs to keep their Canyon in good working order.
