The 2021 GMC Canyon is a mid-size pickup truck known for its maneuverability, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. It offers a blend of practicality and refinement that appeals to those who want a truck that's easier to handle than a full-size model. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of owner complaints and reported issues. Engine options for the 2021 Canyon include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 200 horsepower and 191 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 generating 308 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Duramax turbodiesel inline-4 with 181 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6L V6 and 2.8L Duramax Diesel both utilize an 8-speed automatic. While the Canyon is praised for its off-road capabilities (especially in the AT4 trim) and comfortable interior (especially in higher trims), some owners have voiced concerns about the reliability of certain components.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption between oil changes, requiring them to add oil frequently. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke (though this is less common), and the need to add quarts of oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: The fix can vary depending on the cause. A compression test and leak-down test can help determine if the piston rings are the issue. If so, piston ring replacement is necessary. In some cases, a faulty PCV valve or valve stem seals can also contribute to oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (if piston ring replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, loss of power, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (per injector, depending on location and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbodiesel Inline-4**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light related to DEF system, reduced engine power, "Service Exhaust Fluid System" message. The DEF system can have issues with the DEF injector, DEF level sensor, or DEF pump.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific component failure within the DEF system and replacement of the faulty part. This can include flushing the DEF tank in case of contaminated fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines Except 2.5L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, or 2nd and 3rd gear. Clunking noises during shifting, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation when shifting.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. If that doesn't resolve the issue, a transmission fluid flush may help. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or full transmission replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) - $3,000+ (for transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of ball joints, tie rod ends, and/or control arm bushings. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front end, uneven tire wear, and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components. It's often recommended to replace these components in pairs (e.g., both ball joints on one side) to ensure even wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the components and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or exhibit glitches such as screen flickering or random restarts.
    *   Solution: A software update to the infotainment system is often the first step. In some cases, a hard reset or replacement of the infotainment system module may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $500 - $1,500+ (for module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, even when the vehicle is not in use. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery.
    * Solution: Troubleshooting to identify parasitic drain. Common culprits include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a malfunctioning alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ (depending on source of drain and necessary repairs)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning blows warm air, inconsistent cooling, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the A/C system to identify leaks, compressor failure, or electrical issues. Repairs may involve refrigerant recharge, component replacement, or wiring repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 GMC Canyon, while generally a reliable truck, can experience some notable issues. The 3.6L V6's potential for excessive oil consumption is a concern that can lead to costly repairs. Transmission harshness with the 8-speed automatic is a common complaint, though often addressed with software updates. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system, can be frustrating. While most issues are not considered critical safety hazards, their repair costs can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the severity and the specific component affected. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and consider a pre-purchase inspection to assess the vehicle's condition.
