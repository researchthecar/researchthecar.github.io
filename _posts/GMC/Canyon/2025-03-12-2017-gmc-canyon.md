The 2017 GMC Canyon is a mid-size pickup truck offering a blend of practicality and comfort. It's available in various configurations, including different cab styles (extended cab and crew cab) and bed lengths. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 200 hp and 191 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 making 308 hp and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I4 that delivers 181 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 6-speed manual (on base 2WD extended cab models with the 2.5L I4), a 6-speed automatic (primarily with the 2.5L and 2.8L diesel), and an 8-speed automatic (paired with the 3.6L V6). Owners often praise the Canyon for its manageable size, fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel), and comfortable interior compared to some competitors. Common complaints include some transmission quirks, certain infotainment system issues, and potential for rust in specific areas.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

No Issues Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may exhibit a rattling noise upon startup, rough idling, and potentially a check engine light illuminated. The code may indicate timing misalignment. This often stems from wear and stretching of the timing chains and premature wear of the chain guides/tensioners.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chains, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored closely.
    *   Solution: The fix varies depending on the root cause. It could range from replacing the valve cover to fix the PCV valve, to replacing the valve stem seals, to a full engine rebuild if piston rings are the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ depending on the root cause
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I4**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the DEF system, including sensor failures, pump failures, and clogged injectors, can lead to reduced engine power, warning lights, and potential "limp mode."
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of faulty DEF system components (sensors, pump, injectors). Cleaning or replacement of the DEF injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Torque converter shudder (vibration) at low speeds.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **"Colorado Shake"/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration, often referred to as the "Colorado Shake" (as it also affects the Chevy Colorado), occurring at low speeds and during light acceleration. Also, reports of harsh shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: GM issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) addressing this issue. The fix typically involves a transmission fluid flush with an updated fluid, in some cases, replacement of the torque converter or the entire transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the ball joints, especially in the lower control arms. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps, and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side, depending on whether ball joints or entire control arms are replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, slow response times, and connectivity problems with smartphones.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In other cases, replacement of the infotainment system module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can occur, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days. This could be due to parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve replacing a faulty module or repairing damaged wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Specific Areas)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rust developing on the frame, around door seams, and in the wheel wells. This is more prevalent in areas with harsh winter conditions and road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, which may involve sanding, patching, and repainting affected areas. Rust prevention measures, such as applying rust inhibitors, are also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the extent of the rust damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**

**Summary**

The 2017 GMC Canyon, while generally a reliable truck, does have some common issues. The 3.6L V6 engine can suffer from timing chain problems, while the 8-speed automatic transmission is known for its "Colorado Shake." Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also reported. Rust in specific areas is a concern, especially in colder climates. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can help prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's long-term reliability. While some issues are minor inconveniences, others, such as timing chain failure or transmission problems, can be costly to repair.
