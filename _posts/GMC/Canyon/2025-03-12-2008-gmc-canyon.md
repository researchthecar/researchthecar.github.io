The 2008 GMC Canyon is a mid-size pickup truck that offers a blend of utility and comfort. Engine options included a 2.9L inline-4 producing 185 hp and 190 lb-ft of torque, a 3.7L inline-5 producing 242 hp and 242 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 producing 300 hp and 320 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (available with the I4 and I5) and a 4-speed automatic (standard with the V8 and optional with the I4 and I5). Owners appreciate the Canyon's maneuverability and decent fuel economy (especially with the I4), but some dislike the relatively cramped rear seats in the extended cab models and the somewhat dated interior. Common complaints include issues with the vehicle's electrical system and rust.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2008 GMC Canyon, while generally a reliable truck, can suffer from a variety of issues. Engine problems, particularly cylinder head cracking (I4 & I5), oil consumption, and lifter failure (V8), can be costly. Transmission issues (harsh shifting, slipping) with the 4L60-E are also fairly common. Rust, electrical problems (BCM, ignition switch), and suspension wear are further concerns. The severity and cost of these repairs can vary significantly, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect any used Canyon before purchasing.
