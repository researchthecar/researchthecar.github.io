### Summary Verdict
The 2017 GMC Canyon demonstrates solid reliability across most of its systems. The gasoline engines (2.5L and 3.6L) and the 6-speed automatic transmissions have proven to be robust with no significant widespread issues reported. The 2.8L Duramax diesel engine, while offering excellent torque and efficiency, has a few documented concerns related to its emissions control system, specifically the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and the AdBlue/DEF system, which can require specific maintenance or component replacement. Electrical issues are minor, primarily concerning infotainment system glitches and occasional battery drain. Overall, the Canyon is a dependable choice, especially with the gasoline powertrains, but diesel owners should be aware of potential emissions system maintenance.
