# 2016 GMC Canyon

### Overview
The 2016 GMC Canyon is a mid-size pickup truck that offered a balance of capability and comfort for its segment. It was available with a choice of two gasoline engines and a diesel option, paired with either a 6-speed automatic or manual transmission. Known for its sturdy build and decent towing capacity, the Canyon aimed to appeal to both work-oriented buyers and those seeking a more maneuverable truck than a full-size model. Reliability for the 2016 model year is generally considered good, with most reported issues being minor or related to specific component failures rather than widespread design flaws. Owners often praise its ride quality and the availability of the torquey Duramax diesel engine.

### Summary Verdict
The 2016 GMC Canyon demonstrates solid reliability, particularly with its gasoline engine options. The 2.8L Duramax diesel, while offering excellent torque and fuel economy, has a notable potential issue with its Diesel Particulate Filter system, which can require maintenance or repair. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are the most commonly cited non-engine-related problems. Overall, the Canyon is a dependable mid-size truck, and most owners report a positive ownership experience with minimal unexpected repairs outside of routine maintenance and the specific diesel exhaust system concerns.
