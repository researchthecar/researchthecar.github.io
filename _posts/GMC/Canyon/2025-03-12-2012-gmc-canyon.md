The 2012 GMC Canyon is a compact pickup truck known for its maneuverability and decent fuel economy for its class. Engine options for the 2012 Canyon include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 185 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, a 2.9L inline-4 producing 185 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, a 3.7L inline-5 producing 242 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 producing 302 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic (mainly paired with the inline engines), and a 5-speed automatic (mainly paired with the V8 engine). Owners often appreciate the Canyon's smaller size which makes it easier to park and navigate in urban environments, as well as its affordability. Common complaints include a somewhat dated interior, lower-quality interior materials, and limited rear seat space in the extended cab models.

**Engine**

**2.9L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs. This can manifest as lower oil levels than expected between oil changes, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can address the issue, though this is a major repair. More conservatively, some owners have changed to heavier weight oils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.7L Inline-5**

*   **Camshaft Actuator Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, poor acceleration, and a check engine light related to camshaft position. The solenoid can become clogged or fail electronically.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft actuator solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fluctuating or inaccurate oil pressure readings on the gauge, or a "check engine" light related to oil pressure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifts between gears, slipping during acceleration, or failure to shift properly. Can be caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low fluid level.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and filter change might resolve minor issues. More severe problems require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (flush) - $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5L40E 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, particularly at lower speeds or during light acceleration. Often caused by worn torque converter clutch.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with a friction modifier additive might help. If the shudder persists, torque converter replacement is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (flush with additive) - $800 - $1500 (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Excessive play in the front wheels when checked.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the truck sitting lower than usual, especially when loaded. Squeaking noises from the rear suspension. In extreme cases, a broken leaf spring can be visible.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks not working properly, intermittently or completely failing to lock or unlock using the key fob or door switch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: HVAC blower motor only working on some speeds (usually high) or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Cab Corners**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower rocker panels and cab corners, especially in areas with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the rusted panels. This can range from patching small areas to replacing entire panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per side depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or use of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $1000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Fabric Wear/Tears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rips and tears in the seat fabric.
    *   Solution: Seat cover replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2012 GMC Canyon, while a capable compact truck, has a number of potential issues owners should be aware of. Engine issues range from manageable sensor replacements to more significant oil consumption problems, with corresponding cost variations. The transmissions can suffer from hard shifting or torque converter shudder, potentially requiring costly repairs. Suspension components such as ball joints and leaf springs are also prone to wear and can require replacement. Electrical problems with door locks and the HVAC system are common and relatively inexpensive to fix. Rust, particularly on the rocker panels, is a common problem in colder climates.
