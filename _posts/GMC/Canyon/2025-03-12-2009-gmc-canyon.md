The 2009 GMC Canyon is a mid-size pickup truck that offers a blend of practicality and utility. Available engine options for the 2009 model year include a 2.5L Inline-4, a 2.9L Inline-4, and a 3.7L Inline-5. The 2.9L Inline-4 engine produces around 185 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Canyon's maneuverability, fuel efficiency (relative to larger trucks), and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated interior, limited rear seat space in extended cab models, and the engine's performance when towing or hauling heavy loads.

**Summary**

The 2009 GMC Canyon has several common issues, ranging from minor electrical problems to more significant engine and transmission concerns. Engine misfires, transmission issues, suspension wear, and electrical failures like the blower motor resistor are frequently reported. Rust on rocker panels and dashboard cracking are also common. While some issues, such as replacing the blower motor resistor, are relatively inexpensive to fix, more extensive repairs like transmission rebuilds or rust repair can be costly. Severity varies widely based on the specific issue and the vehicle's maintenance history. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems before purchase.
