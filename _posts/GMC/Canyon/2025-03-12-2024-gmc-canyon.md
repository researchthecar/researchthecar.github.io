The 2024 GMC Canyon marks the second year of the truck's third generation, a complete redesign that boasts a more rugged and modern aesthetic. It is only available in Crew Cab/Short Bed configuration. The sole engine option is a turbocharged 2.7L inline-4, offered in three different output levels. Some drivers appreciate the Canyon's updated interior, off-road capability, and technological features. Conversely, criticisms often include a higher price point compared to competitors and reported issues with the infotainment system. The 2.7L Turbo High-Output engine provides 310 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque. All trim levels utilize an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.7L Turbo High-Output (L3B)**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine misfires and a rough idle, particularly at lower RPMs. This can be intermittent, occurring more frequently under load or during cold starts. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to cylinder misfires.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors, and vacuum leaks. A software update or PCM recalibration may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, faulty fuel injectors or coils may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of turbocharger failure have surfaced, manifesting as a loss of power, unusual noises (whining, screeching), and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnosis typically involves inspecting the turbocharger for damage, leaks, or impeller issues.
    * Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit. It is recommended to check the oil supply line to the turbocharger for blockage to prevent premature failure.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L80/8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between lower gears (1st to 3rd). Hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating from a stop has also been reported.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and fluid change might improve the shifting behavior. In some cases, a software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) or replacement of valve body components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, responsible for navigation, audio, and vehicle settings, is prone to freezing, lagging, or completely crashing. This can occur randomly or during specific functions.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. Performing a hard reset of the system (if possible) may also provide temporary relief. If the problem persists, replacement of the infotainment system unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,500+ (depending on warranty coverage and if a replacement unit is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Blind Spot Monitoring, Lane Departure Warning)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or constant false alerts from safety systems like blind spot monitoring and lane departure warning. These issues can be triggered by environmental factors or without any apparent reason.
    *   Solution: Calibration of the affected sensors is the first step. If the problem continues, replacement of the faulty sensor(s) will be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks (Cab Area)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported water leaks into the cab area, particularly around the windshield or sunroof (if equipped) during rain or washing.
    *   Solution: Inspection and resealing of the windshield or sunroof. Ensure proper drainage channels are clear of debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Interior panels, especially in the dashboard or door panels, may develop rattling or squeaking noises during driving, particularly on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and applying felt tape or foam padding to dampen vibrations. Tightening loose fasteners may also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (depending on whether DIY or professional repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 GMC Canyon, while a redesigned and capable truck, appears to have some common issues. The issues with the 2.7L Turbo engine and 8-speed transmission may be costly to repair. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions can also be a source of frustration. Interior rattles and water leaks, while less severe, can detract from the overall ownership experience. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, emphasizing the importance of a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
