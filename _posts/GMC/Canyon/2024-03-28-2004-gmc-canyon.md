**Introduction:**

The 2004 GMC Canyon is a midsize pickup truck known for its rugged capability and versatility. It came with two engine options: a 2.8L I-4 and a 3.5L I-5. The 2.8L I-4 produced 175 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.5L I-5 generated 220 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.

Owners appreciate the Canyon's towing capacity, off-road capabilities, and spacious interior. However, it has also faced criticism for its outdated design, poor fuel economy, and limited safety features.
