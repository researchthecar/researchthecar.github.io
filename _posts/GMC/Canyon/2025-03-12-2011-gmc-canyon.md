The 2011 GMC Canyon is a mid-size pickup truck known for its maneuverability and fuel efficiency compared to full-size trucks. It offers a practical solution for those needing a truck for light-duty tasks. Engine options include a 2.9L inline-4 producing 185 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, a 3.7L inline-5 generating 242 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 delivering 302 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine and configuration. Common likes include its compact size, ease of parking, and decent fuel economy (especially with the I4). Dislikes often center around the interior quality, limited rear seat space in the extended cab models, and the dated 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.9L Inline-4**
*   **Cylinder Head Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and eventually, potential engine failure. This issue occurs due to a casting flaw in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.7L Inline-5**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, and illuminated check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage. This is sometimes attributed to the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system.
    *   Solution: Installation of an AFM disabler device, or replacement of the AFM lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+

    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at certain speeds, especially during lock-up, stalling, or complete failure of the transmission to engage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of blower motor function on certain speeds, typically leading to the blower only working on the highest speed setting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**

**Summary**
The 2011 GMC Canyon, while generally a reliable truck, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly with the cylinder head on the 2.9L I4 and the AFM system on the 5.3L V8, can be costly to repair. The 4-speed automatic transmission is also a known weak point. Other problems, such as suspension wear and electrical issues, are more typical for a vehicle of this age. Overall, pre-purchase inspection is recommended, and buyers should pay close attention to the transmission's condition and any signs of engine trouble.
