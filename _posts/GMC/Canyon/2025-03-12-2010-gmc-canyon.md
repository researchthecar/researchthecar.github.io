The 2010 GMC Canyon is a mid-size pickup truck known for its maneuverability and fuel efficiency compared to full-size trucks. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 (185 hp, 190 lb-ft torque), a 2.9L inline-4 (185 hp, 190 lb-ft torque), a 3.7L inline-5 (242 hp, 242 lb-ft torque), and a 5.3L V8 (300 hp, 320 lb-ft torque). Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, and a 5-speed automatic (depending on engine). People often appreciate the Canyon's smaller size for city driving and its ability to handle light-duty tasks. Downsides often mentioned are the interior quality, limited rear seat space in the extended cab models, and the relatively dated design compared to newer trucks.

**Summary**

The 2010 GMC Canyon has several potential issues, ranging from moderate to severe. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the 5.3L V8 and catalytic converter failures in the 2.9 and 3.7 models, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially in the 4L60E automatic, are also a significant concern. Electrical problems stemming from the BCM and ignition switch can be frustrating. Suspension issues such as ball joint failure and leaf spring issues can also cause problems for owners. While some issues like dashboard cracking are mostly cosmetic, others, such as engine or transmission failures, can lead to extensive and expensive repairs. Potential buyers should carefully inspect vehicles and be aware of these common problems.
