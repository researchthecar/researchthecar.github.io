### Summary Verdict
The 2004 GMC Envoy XL, while offering a comfortable and capable driving experience, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and class. The inline-six and V8 engines can be robust but are susceptible to intake manifold leaks and, in the case of the V8, issues with the Active Fuel Management system. The 4-speed automatic transmission, while generally durable, can develop problems with the torque converter clutch or solenoids. Suspension components like wheel bearings and the optional rear air suspension are also noted areas for potential repair. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or ignition switch, can cause frustrating intermittent issues. Exterior rust and interior HVAC blend door actuators are also frequently reported. Overall, the Envoy XL can be a reliable vehicle with proper maintenance and addressing these known issues proactively.
