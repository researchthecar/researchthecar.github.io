**Introduction:**
The 2005 GMC Envoy XL is a mid-size SUV available with either a 4.2L inline-6 or a 5.3L V8 engine, both paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. It offers a spacious cabin, comfortable ride, and decent off-road capabilities. However, it has some drawbacks such as subpar fuel economy and outdated interior design.

**Engine**

**4.2L Inline-6**
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, leading to coolant leaks, reduced engine power, and overheating. Symptoms include a sweet smell from the engine compartment, low coolant levels, and rough idling. The solution is to replace the gasket, which costs around $300 - $500+.
* **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure:** The oil pressure sensor can malfunction, providing inaccurate readings and potentially causing engine damage if not addressed promptly. Symptoms include an illuminated oil pressure warning light, erratic oil pressure readings, and a loss of oil pressure. Replacing the oil pressure sensor costs approximately $100 - $200+.

**5.3L V8**
* **AFM (Active Fuel Management) System Issues:** The AFM system, which deactivates cylinders under certain driving conditions to improve fuel economy, can experience problems. This can result in rough idling, engine misfires, and decreased fuel efficiency. The solution may involve replacing solenoids, lifters, or the engine control module (ECM), costing $500 - $1,500+.
* **Exhaust Manifold Gasket Failure:** The exhaust manifold gasket can fail, causing exhaust leaks and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a ticking or rattling noise from the engine compartment, reduced engine power, and overheating. Repairing this issue involves replacing the gasket, costing around $250 - $400+.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**
* **TCC (Torque Converter Clutch) Solenoid Failure:** The TCC solenoid can malfunction, leading to transmission problems such as slipping, shuddering, and overheating. This typically requires replacing the solenoid, costing around $200 - $350+.
* **Transmission Filter Clogging:** The transmission filter can become clogged with debris over time, restricting fluid flow and causing transmission problems. Symptoms include rough shifting, delayed engagement, and slipping. The solution is to replace the filter, which costs approximately $100 - $200+.

**Suspension**

* **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure:** The front control arm bushings can wear out over time, causing excessive tire wear, a rattling or clunking noise from the front suspension, and reduced handling precision. Replacing the bushings costs around $200 - $300+ per side.
* **Front Sway Bar End Link Failure:** The front sway bar end links can fail, resulting in a clunking or rattling noise from the front suspension, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Replacing the end links costs approximately $100 - $150+ per side.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, causing electrical problems such as dim lights, difficulty starting the vehicle, and a dead battery. This issue requires replacing the alternator, costing around $500 - $700+.
* **Battery Drain:** The battery can experience a parasitic drain due to faulty electrical components or accessories, resulting in a dead battery after the vehicle is parked. The solution is to identify and fix the underlying electrical issue, which can cost $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.

**Exterior**

* **Rear Hatch Struts Failure:** The rear hatch struts can weaken over time, causing the hatch to sag or fail to open or close properly. Replacing the struts costs around $100 - $200+ per pair.
* **Weatherstripping Issues:** The weatherstripping around the doors and windows can deteriorate over time, allowing water to leak into the cabin. This can lead to mold, mildew, and other problems. Replacing the weatherstripping costs approximately $100 - $200+ per section.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking:** The dashboard can crack over time due to exposure to heat and sunlight. This is a cosmetic issue that does not affect the functionality of the vehicle but can be unsightly. Repairing the dashboard costs around $500 - $1,000+.
* **Door Panel Sagging:** The door panels can sag or become loose, affecting the appearance of the interior. Tightening or replacing the door panel mounting brackets costs approximately $100 - $300+ per door.

**Summary:**

The 2005 GMC Envoy XL has a few potential issues to be aware of, but most are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix. The most severe issues include AFM system problems, transmission slippage, and electrical problems. Overall, the Envoy XL is a reliable vehicle that provides a comfortable and versatile driving experience.
