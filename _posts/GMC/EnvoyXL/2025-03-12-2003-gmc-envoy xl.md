The 2003 GMC Envoy XL is a mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior, particularly the extended XL version. While owners appreciate the Envoy XL's cargo capacity and towing capability, some common complaints revolve around reliability. The 2003 model year was available with two engine options: a 4.2L Inline-6 engine producing 270 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 engine producing 290 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. Some drivers found the fuel economy of the Envoy XL to be less than desirable, and others mentioned that the interior plastics felt cheap.

**Engine**

**4.2L Inline-6**

*   **Faulty Ignition Coil**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illuminated (typically with a P0300 series code indicating a misfire on a specific cylinder).
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil. It is often recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per coil (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Actuator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noises from the engine, especially at idle, loss of power, decreased fuel economy, check engine light (P0016 or P0017 codes).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft actuator solenoid or the camshaft actuator itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fluctuating or inaccurate oil pressure readings on the dashboard gauge, check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil levels, needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause (worn valve seals, piston rings, etc.), the solution can range from using thicker oil to a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (thicker oil) - $3,000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or jerky shifts between gears, especially from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd.
    *   Solution: Could be due to low transmission fluid, faulty shift solenoids, or internal damage. Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnosis is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush and filter), $200-$800+ (solenoid replacement/internal repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revving without corresponding acceleration, difficulty maintaining speed, especially on inclines.
    *   Solution: Low transmission fluid, worn clutch packs, or valve body issues. A rebuild or replacement of the transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, air compressor running constantly, "Service Ride Control" message on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Leaks in the air springs, faulty air compressor, or problems with the ride height sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per air spring, $300-$600+ (compressor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Humming or grinding noise from the front wheels, especially when turning, excessive play in the wheel when lifted.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty wheel bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per wheel.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Panel Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges not working correctly, flickering lights, or complete failure of the instrument panel.

**Summary**

The 2003 GMC Envoy XL, while comfortable and spacious, presents some common issues. Engine problems range from relatively inexpensive fixes like ignition coil or sensor replacements to more significant issues like camshaft actuator problems or oil consumption in the V8. Transmission issues with the 4L60E, such as harsh shifting and slipping, can be costly to address. Suspension problems, particularly with the air suspension (if equipped), can also contribute to the overall cost of ownership. Electrical and interior issues, while less severe, can still be frustrating and require attention. Overall, a thorough inspection before purchasing a 2003 GMC Envoy XL is recommended, paying close attention to these common problem areas. The severity and cost of repairs vary greatly depending on the specific issue and the vehicle's condition.
