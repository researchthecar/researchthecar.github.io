### Summary Verdict
The 2005 GMC Envoy XL, particularly with the V8 engine option, can be a reliable vehicle if well-maintained, but it is not without its common issues. Powertrain components, especially the 4L60-E transmission and the V8's Active Fuel Management system, are known to require attention. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and ignition switch are also frequently reported. Suspension components like wheel bearings and ball joints are typical wear items that may need replacement. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, specific components like the liftgate latch and HVAC blend doors can fail. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and budget for potential repairs, especially if purchasing a higher-mileage example.
