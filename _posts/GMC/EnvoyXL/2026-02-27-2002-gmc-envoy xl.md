### Summary Verdict
The 2002 GMC Envoy XL is a capable large SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The engines, particularly the 4.2L Atlas I6 and the 5.3L Vortec V8, can experience costly problems like intake manifold leaks and, in the case of the V8, AFM lifter failures. The 4L60-E transmission is prone to torque converter and solenoid issues. Suspension components, especially ball joints, and the optional rear air suspension can require attention. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM and alternator, are also reported. Rust can be a concern on exterior panels. Interior climate control and gauge cluster issues are not uncommon. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Envoy XLs have provided reliable service when properly maintained and when these specific issues are addressed.
