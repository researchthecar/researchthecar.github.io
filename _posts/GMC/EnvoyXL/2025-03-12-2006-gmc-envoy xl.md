The 2006 GMC Envoy XL is a mid-size SUV that offered a longer wheelbase and more cargo space compared to the standard Envoy. Engine options included a 4.2L Inline-6 engine producing 291 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 engine producing 302 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4L60-E 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Envoy XL for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and towing capacity. Common complaints included fuel economy, some reliability issues, and the somewhat dated interior.

**Summary**

The 2006 GMC Envoy XL has several potential problem areas. The engine, particularly the 4.2L Inline-6 and the 5.3L V8, can experience issues with oil consumption, sensor failures, and AFM problems. The transmission may suffer from slipping or harsh shifting. Suspension components like the air suspension compressor and ball joints can also fail. Electrical problems, such as instrument cluster issues and power window motor failures, are also noted. Many repairs will cost several hundred dollars or more, and major repairs, such as transmission rebuilds, can be quite expensive. The age of the vehicle means that maintenance and repair costs are likely to be a significant factor in ownership.
