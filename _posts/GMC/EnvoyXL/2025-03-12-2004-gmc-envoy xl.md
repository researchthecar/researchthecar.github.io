The 2004 GMC Envoy XL is a mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. It was offered with three engine options: a 4.2L Inline-6 (producing approximately 275 hp and 275 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (producing approximately 290 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque), and a 4.2L Inline-6 (producing approximately 270 hp and 275 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 4L60-E 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Envoy XL for its towing capacity and cargo space. Common complaints include issues with the electrical system, particularly the instrument panel, and the ride quality over rough roads due to the aging suspension components.
