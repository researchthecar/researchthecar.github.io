# 2003 GMC Envoy XL

### Overview
The 2003 GMC Envoy XL, a full-size SUV, offered a blend of passenger comfort and utility, often equipped with a robust V8 engine. While generally considered a capable vehicle for its time, like many SUVs of this era, it has specific areas that have shown a propensity for issues as they age. Owners have reported concerns primarily related to the powertrain, particularly with certain transmission components and engine accessories. Electrical systems and interior components can also present challenges, often stemming from age and mileage. Suspension and exterior elements tend to be more durable, though not entirely immune to wear and tear.

### Summary Verdict
The 2003 GMC Envoy XL is a capable SUV, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues that arise with age and mileage. The 4.2L inline-six and 5.3L V8 engines can experience gasket leaks and, in the case of the V8, AFM-related problems. The 4L60-E transmission is prone to issues with its clutch packs and solenoids. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are also noted. Interior comfort can be affected by HVAC blend door actuator failures. While suspension and exterior components are generally robust, proactive maintenance and inspection of these known problem areas are recommended for long-term reliability.
