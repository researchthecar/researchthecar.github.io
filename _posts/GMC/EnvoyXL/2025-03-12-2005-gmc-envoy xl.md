The 2005 GMC Envoy XL is a mid-size SUV offering a longer wheelbase and increased cargo capacity compared to the standard Envoy. This year, the Envoy XL was available with two engine options: a 4.2L inline-six engine producing 275 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 engine producing 300 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Envoy XL for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and towing capability. However, common complaints included issues with the electrical system, suspension components, and fuel economy.

**Summary**

The 2005 GMC Envoy XL is prone to a range of issues, with engine problems (especially oil consumption) being a major concern. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the instrument panel and transfer case encoder motor, are also common. Suspension issues, if equipped with air suspension, can add to the ownership costs. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine rebuilds or transmission replacements, can be quite costly. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems when considering a used 2005 GMC Envoy XL.
