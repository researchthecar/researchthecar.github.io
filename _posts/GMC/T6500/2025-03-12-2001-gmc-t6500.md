The 2001 GMC T6500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial applications like delivery, construction, and service vehicles. This model year offered several engine and transmission options to cater to various needs. Available engine options included the Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine, producing around 175-330 horsepower and 420-860 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific tuning. Some owners appreciate the truck's durability and workhorse capabilities, while others find the ride quality and interior comfort lacking compared to modern vehicles. Common complaints often revolve around age-related wear and tear on components and the higher maintenance costs associated with commercial vehicles.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2001 GMC T6500, while a capable work truck, is prone to age-related issues, especially concerning the engine, transmission, and suspension. The Caterpillar 3126 engine can suffer from injector and HPOP failures, while the Allison transmissions are susceptible to shifting problems and torque converter issues. Electrical problems due to wiring harness degradation and rust are also common. Repair costs can vary significantly, with some issues being relatively inexpensive to fix, while others, such as major engine or transmission work, can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and budget for potential repairs.
