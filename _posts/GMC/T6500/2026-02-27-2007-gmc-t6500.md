### Summary Verdict
The 2007 GMC T6500 demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its robust Isuzu and Caterpillar diesel engines and dependable Allison transmissions. The most common issues tend to be related to the demanding nature of commercial use, such as potential EGR cooler leaks and fuel injector problems on the diesel engines, and clutch wear on manual transmissions. Electrical components like wiring harnesses and alternators can also require attention over time. Suspension leaf springs and interior components like the HVAC blower motor are also noted areas for potential repair. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of wear are crucial for maximizing the longevity and operational efficiency of these workhorses.
