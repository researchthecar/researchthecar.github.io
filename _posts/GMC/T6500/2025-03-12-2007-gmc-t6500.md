The 2007 GMC T6500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial applications such as hauling, construction, and delivery. Engine options include the Duramax 6.6L Diesel V8 and the Vortec 8.1L Gas V8. The Duramax 6.6L typically produces around 330 horsepower and 620 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include Allison automatics. Owners generally appreciate the T6500's reliability, strong towing capacity, and robust build. Common dislikes include fuel economy (especially with the gas engine), ride comfort, and relatively basic interior features.

**Engine**

**Duramax 6.6L Diesel V8 (LLY)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, excessive smoke, decreased fuel economy, and eventual engine damage if left unaddressed. Often caused by overheating due to inadequate cooling system maintenance.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors. Ensure the cooling system is properly maintained to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per injector, depending on location and labor rates.

*   **Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: High coolant temperature gauge readings, coolant leaks, steam from the engine bay, and potential engine damage if not addressed quickly. Caused by clogged radiators, faulty thermostats, or failing water pumps.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the overheating (radiator flush, thermostat replacement, water pump replacement, or head gasket replacement).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+ depending on the component that needs replacing and labor rates.

**Vortec 8.1L Gas V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often noticeable between oil changes. Can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. May require piston ring replacement or valve seal repair in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the extent of the repair.

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leak noise, reduced engine performance, and potential exhaust fumes entering the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replace cracked exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Transmission**

**Allison Automatic (1000/2000 Series)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, transmission slipping, and potentially complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. May also require flushing the transmission fluid and inspecting for debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+

*   **Shift Solenoid Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, or failure to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty shift solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging, uneven ride height, and reduced load-carrying capacity. Cracking can be visible on the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace worn or cracked leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring pack, depending on location and labor rates.

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, wandering on the road, and clunking noises from the front suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side, depending on the part and location.

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, sensors malfunctioning, or starting problems. Often caused by corrosion or damage to the wiring harness.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair or replace damaged sections of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity and location of the damage.

*   **Glow Plug Failure (Diesel)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, excessive white smoke upon startup, and rough running.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty glow plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the vehicle's undercarriage and body panels.
    *   Solution: Treat rust with rust converter. Cut out and weld in new pieces if the rust is bad enough. Repaint if needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+, depending on the severity and location of the rust.

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor does not work. No air is blowing from the vents.
    *   Solution: Replace the HVAC blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner material begins to sag or detach from the roof.
    *   Solution: Replace or re-glue the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the size and labor rates.

**Summary:**

The 2007 GMC T6500, while a reliable workhorse, does have some common issues to watch out for. The Duramax diesel can suffer from fuel injector problems and overheating, while the Vortec gas engine may experience oil consumption and exhaust manifold cracking. Transmission issues with the Allison automatic, particularly torque converter failure, can be costly. Suspension wear and tear, especially leaf spring issues, are common due to the truck's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues and rust are also potential problems. Repair costs can range from relatively minor to quite significant, depending on the issue and the extent of the damage. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the truck's maintenance history and condition to avoid costly surprises.
