### Summary Verdict
The 2000 GMC T6500 generally exhibits good mechanical reliability, especially concerning its robust diesel engines and durable transmissions, provided they are maintained properly. Common issues tend to be concentrated in areas susceptible to heavy use and environmental factors, such as the electrical system (wiring corrosion) and the exterior (rust). While powertrain components like injectors and turbochargers can require attention, these are often within expected parameters for commercial vehicles. Suspension and interior components, while not immune to failure, are less frequently reported as major issues. Overall, the T6500 is a dependable workhorse, but owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to its age and intended application.
