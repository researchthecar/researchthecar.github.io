### Summary Verdict
The 2001 GMC T6500, particularly with its diesel engine options, exhibits some common commercial vehicle wear points. The Detroit Diesel and Isuzu engines can experience issues with fuel delivery (injector pumps) and emissions systems (EGR valves), while turbocharger failures are also noted. Transmissions, both automatic (Allison) and manual (Eaton), can develop problems with torque converters, solenoids, clutches, and synchronizers, which are typical for heavy-duty use. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks are subject to wear and potential breakage under load. Electrical system issues, primarily related to wiring harness integrity and alternator function, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on the operating environment. Interiorly, HVAC blower motors and dashboard gauge reliability are areas that may require attention. Overall, while generally robust, the T6500 requires diligent maintenance and awareness of these specific potential failure points to ensure continued operational reliability.
