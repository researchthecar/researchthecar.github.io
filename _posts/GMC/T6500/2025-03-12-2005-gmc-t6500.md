The 2005 GMC T6500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial applications such as delivery services and construction. It's appreciated for its robust chassis and versatility, allowing for various body configurations. However, owners have reported some common issues impacting reliability and maintenance costs. Engine options included the Duramax diesel engines, such as the 6.6L LB7 and LLY, known for their power and torque. A common transmission option was the Allison 1000 series automatic transmission. Some owners have complained about the rough ride quality and relatively spartan interior compared to more modern trucks.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax LB7 Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: High pressure fuel injectors in the LB7 engine are known to fail, often caused by fuel contamination and heat. Symptoms include rough idling, white smoke from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy, and a noticeable loss of power. The engine might also exhibit a "knocking" or "ticking" sound.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed injectors is the primary solution. It's recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure balanced fuel delivery. Additionally, cleaning the fuel system and checking the fuel pressure regulator and fuel lines is important to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on labor rates and whether all injectors are replaced at once.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Glow plugs assist in starting the engine, especially in cold weather. Over time, they can fail, causing hard starting, excessive cranking, and white smoke upon startup. Broken glow plugs can also cause engine damage if they fall into the cylinder.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty glow plugs and ensuring proper installation torque is crucial. Testing the glow plug controller is also advisable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the number of glow plugs replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax LLY Diesel**

*   **Overheating**
    * Description/Symptoms: The LLY engine is prone to overheating, especially when towing heavy loads or climbing steep grades. This can be caused by a clogged radiator, faulty thermostat, or a malfunctioning fan clutch.
    * Solution: Thoroughly flush the cooling system, replace the thermostat with an updated design (if available), inspect and replace the fan clutch if necessary, and ensure the radiator is clean and free of obstructions. Adding an aftermarket coolant temperature gauge can help monitor engine temperatures.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the failed part.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger may fail prematurely, resulting in reduced power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, and potentially a loud whining or screeching noise. This can be caused by oil starvation, foreign object damage, or wear and tear.
    * Solution: Replace the turbocharger with a new or remanufactured unit. Inspect the oil supply lines to the turbocharger for blockages and ensure proper oil pressure.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the cost of the turbocharger and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 Series Automatic Transmission**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering, slipping, and difficulty engaging gears. A common symptom is a "stall" when coming to a stop.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter with a new or remanufactured unit is the typical solution. It's also recommended to flush the transmission fluid and inspect for any debris that might have contributed to the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ depending on the shop and parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning shift solenoids can cause hard shifting, delayed shifting, or failure to shift into certain gears. The transmission might also get stuck in "limp mode."
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty shift solenoid(s) and performing a transmission fluid flush is the recommended repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the number of solenoids replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy-duty nature of the T6500, the leaf springs are subjected to significant stress. Over time, they can sag or even break, leading to a rough ride, reduced load capacity, and potential handling issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn or broken leaf springs with new, heavy-duty units is the most effective solution. Consider upgrading to aftermarket leaf springs with a higher load rating for improved performance and durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shocks dampen the movement of the suspension. When shocks wear out, the vehicle will bounce more and ride quality will be reduced. This will also have an effect on the handling of the vehicle.
    * Solution: Replacing the shocks with new units.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the shop and parts.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to exposure to harsh environments and the age of the vehicle, the wiring harness can experience corrosion, fraying, and damaged connectors. This can lead to a variety of electrical problems, including intermittent lights, sensor malfunctions, and starting issues.
    *   Solution: Inspecting the wiring harness for damage and repairing or replacing damaged sections is crucial. Using dielectric grease on connectors can help prevent future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the damage and the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator is responsible for charging the battery and powering the vehicle's electrical system. A failing alternator can result in a dead battery, dimming lights, and a "check engine" light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty alternator with a new or remanufactured unit is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the alternator and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Cab Corners and Rocker Panels)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can form in the cab corners and rocker panels.
    *   Solution: Cut out the rust, weld in new metal, and repaint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor can fail, resulting in the inability to blow air through the vents for heating or cooling. This can be caused by a worn-out motor, a clogged blower motor resistor, or a faulty wiring connection.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor and inspecting the blower motor resistor and wiring are the solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ depending on labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found
