### Summary Verdict
The 2002 GMC T6500, while generally robust for its intended commercial use, exhibits some common reliability concerns, particularly within its powertrain options. Engines like the Caterpillar 3126B and Isuzu 6HK1-TCC can experience issues with injectors, turbochargers, and EGR systems, requiring significant repair costs. Automatic transmissions, specifically the Allison 2000 series, may develop problems with the torque converter or solenoids. Manual transmissions can suffer from clutch and synchronizer wear. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks are also subject to wear and potential failure. Electrical issues, primarily related to wiring harness corrosion and alternator failure, are not uncommon. Rust on the exterior and HVAC or gauge problems in the interior are also points to monitor. Proactive maintenance and addressing early symptoms are crucial for maximizing the lifespan and operational efficiency of these work trucks.
