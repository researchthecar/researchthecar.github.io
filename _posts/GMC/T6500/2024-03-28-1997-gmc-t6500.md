**Summary**

The 1997 GMC T6500 is a durable and powerful workhorse, but it is not without its issues. The most common problems include fuel injector and turbocharger failure in the engine, clutch and transmission gear noise in the transmission, leaf spring and shock absorber failure in the suspension, alternator failure and battery discharge in the electrical system, rust on the frame and headlight bulb failure in the exterior, and climate control failure and dashboard cracking in the interior.

The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the severity of the failure and the specific parts that need to be replaced. Some issues, such as headlight bulb failure, are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, while others, such as turbocharger failure or transmission gear damage, can be more costly. It is important for owners to be aware of these potential problems and to have them addressed promptly to prevent further damage or costly repairs.
