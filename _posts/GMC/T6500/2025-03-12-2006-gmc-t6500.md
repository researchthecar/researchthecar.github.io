The 2006 GMC T6500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial applications like delivery, construction, and utility work. It's appreciated for its robust build, workhorse capabilities, and relatively simple design which makes it easier to maintain than some newer trucks. However, its age means many examples have seen significant use, leading to wear and tear and potential issues. Dislikes often revolve around the ride quality, which can be harsh, and the relatively basic interior compared to modern trucks.

The 2006 GMC T6500 offered several engine and transmission options. This analysis will focus on the most common configuration: the Duramax Diesel engine and Allison transmission, as those are the most commonly used and discussed options.

**Engine**

**Duramax Diesel (6.6L LBZ)**

* **Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Duramax LBZ is known for injector issues. Symptoms include rough idling, white smoke from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy, and a ticking sound.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty injectors. It is recommended to replace all 8 injectors at the same time to ensure balanced performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the shop and location).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Leak at CP3 Pump**
    * Description/Symptoms: A fuel leak can develop at the CP3 high-pressure fuel pump. This results in a diesel smell and potential fuel dripping.
    * Solution: Replace the CP3 pump or rebuild it with new seals if the pump is still in good condition.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (depending on repair approach).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Glow Plug Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult starting in cold weather, excessive white smoke upon startup. A diagnostic scan will likely show codes related to glow plug circuit malfunction.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty glow plugs. It is often recommended to replace all glow plugs at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the number of glow plugs replaced and the shop rate).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000/2000 Series**

* **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during lockup of the torque converter, slipping in overdrive, and potential transmission overheating.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter. Flush the transmission cooler lines to remove any debris.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ (depending on the shop).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Shift Solenoid Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifting, or failure to shift into certain gears. Diagnostic codes will likely point to specific shift solenoid(s).
    * Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoid(s). It's a good idea to inspect the valve body for wear and debris as well.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on the shop and the number of solenoids replaced).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Internal Leakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of transmission fluid, slipping gears, delayed engagement, and overheating. Internal leaks can be difficult to pinpoint without disassembly.
    * Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether it's a rebuild or replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The leaf springs can sag over time, especially with heavy use. This leads to a lower ride height, reduced load capacity, and a rougher ride. Broken leaf springs are also possible.
    * Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the truck is frequently used for heavy loads.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the number of springs replaced and the quality of the springs).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, wandering, clunking noises from the front end, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace the worn ball joints and tie rod ends. An alignment is necessary after replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+ (depending on the number of components replaced and the shop rate).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Wiring Harness Corrosion**
    * Description/Symptoms: Electrical issues can arise due to corrosion in the wiring harness, especially in areas exposed to the elements. This can cause intermittent problems with lights, sensors, and other electrical components.
    * Solution: Inspect and repair or replace the affected wiring harness sections. Use dielectric grease on connections to prevent further corrosion.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the severity and extent of the damage).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain quickly, especially if the truck sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or a failing battery.
    * Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replace the faulty component. Test and replace the battery if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause of the drain).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust is a common issue on older vehicles, especially in areas with harsh winters. The T6500 is susceptible to rust on the frame, body panels, and other exposed metal parts.
    * Solution: Treat and repair any rust spots. In severe cases, body panel replacement or frame repair may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity of the rust).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor may fail, resulting in no air blowing from the vents. This can be caused by a worn-out motor or a faulty resistor.
    * Solution: Replace the blower motor or resistor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on the shop rate).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 GMC T6500, while a capable work truck, has some common issues, largely due to its age and use. The most significant potential expenses revolve around engine and transmission repairs, particularly the Duramax's injectors and the Allison transmission's torque converter and internal components. Suspension and electrical issues, as well as rust, are also common concerns. Overall, purchasing a used 2006 GMC T6500 requires a thorough inspection and budgeting for potential repairs to address these known issues.
