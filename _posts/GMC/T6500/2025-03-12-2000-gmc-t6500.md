The 2000 GMC T6500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial applications like delivery, utility work, and landscaping. Engine options include the Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine, the Duramax 7.8L diesel engine, and the Vortec 8.1L gas engine. Transmission options often include Allison automatic transmissions, such as the AT545. The Caterpillar 3126 produces around 175-330 horsepower and 420-860 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific configuration. People often appreciate the T6500 for its reliability, ease of maintenance (compared to newer trucks), and straightforward design. Common dislikes include rough ride, limited features, and fuel economy (especially with gas engines).

**Engine**

**Caterpillar 3126 Diesel Engine**
* **Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, excessive black smoke, and eventual engine misfire or no-start condition.
    * Solution: Replace faulty injectors with new or remanufactured units. Ensure proper fuel pressure and filter maintenance to prevent recurrence.

**Summary**

The 2000 GMC T6500, while generally reliable, can suffer from common issues associated with medium-duty trucks of that era. Engine issues, especially injector and turbocharger problems in the diesel variants, can be costly. Transmission problems, particularly slipping or hard shifting, also represent a significant potential expense. Suspension wear and tear, along with electrical gremlins, are also common. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission repairs can easily run into the thousands of dollars. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the truck, paying close attention to engine performance, transmission behavior, and any signs of rust or electrical problems.
