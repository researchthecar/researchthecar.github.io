### Summary Verdict
The 2004 GMC T6500 generally exhibits good reliability, especially concerning its powertrain, provided it has been maintained. The diesel engines, while powerful, can encounter issues with fuel injectors and turbochargers, particularly with higher mileage. Automatic transmissions like the Allison 2000 series are robust but can develop torque converter or leak issues. Manual transmissions are prone to standard wear on clutches and synchronizers. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs and shocks, are subject to wear and potential breakage under heavy use. Electrical systems can suffer from corrosion, leading to intermittent faults, and alternators may require replacement. Exterior rust is a common concern for vehicles of this age and type. Interior issues are typically limited to HVAC blower motors and gauge cluster malfunctions. Overall, the T6500 is a capable workhorse, but owners should be aware of these potential repair areas to ensure continued operational efficiency.
