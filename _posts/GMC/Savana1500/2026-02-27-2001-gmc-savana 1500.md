### Summary Verdict
The 2001 GMC Savana 1500, while generally a robust vehicle, exhibits some common issues typical for its age and utility focus. Engine reliability is good with the Vortec V8s, though intake manifold gasket leaks are a recurring concern. The 4L60-E transmission can develop issues with the TCC solenoid or 3-4 clutch packs over time. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can arise. Exterior rust is a significant consideration, especially in certain climates. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor and dashboard gauges can also require attention. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing these known issues can ensure continued serviceability.
