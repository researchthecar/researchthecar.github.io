### Summary Verdict
The 2004 GMC Savana 1500, particularly with the V8 engines, is generally a durable vehicle. However, common issues like intake manifold gasket leaks and, on the 5.3L, AFM lifter problems are notable. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60-E, can arise, often related to the torque converter or internal clutch packs. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear due to the vehicle's utility. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are also reported. Owners should be aware of potential rust, especially in corrosive environments, and interior wear like HVAC blower motor issues. Regular maintenance and addressing these specific potential problems can ensure the longevity of the Savana 1500.
