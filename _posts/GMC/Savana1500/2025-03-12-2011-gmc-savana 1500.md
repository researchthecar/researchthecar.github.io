**Summary**

The 2011 GMC Savana 1500 presents a mix of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the 5.3L V8 engine's Active Fuel Management (AFM) system and oil consumption. These issues can lead to costly repairs, potentially running into thousands of dollars. Transmission problems, particularly with the 4L60E and 6L80E, are also relatively common, with rebuilds or replacements being sometimes necessary. Suspension and electrical issues are less severe but still require attention. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection to assess the overall condition of the vehicle.
