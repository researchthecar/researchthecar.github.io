**Summary**

The 2003 GMC Savana 1500, while generally reliable, has some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with oil consumption in the 5.3L V8 and intake manifold leaks in the 4.3L, can be costly. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60E, are also a concern. Suspension components wear over time, leading to ride and handling problems. Electrical issues, like fuel pump and ABS sensor failures, can also occur. Rust is a significant concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine overhauls or transmission replacements, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential issues.
