The 2010 GMC Savana 1500 is a full-size van known for its workhorse capabilities and spacious interior. Available engine options include a 4.3L V6 (276 hp and 294 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp and 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (324 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic transmission for the V6 engine and a 4-speed automatic transmission with the V8 options. People generally appreciate the Savana for its cargo capacity, towing capability, and relatively simple mechanics. Common dislikes include its fuel economy, dated interior, and handling compared to more modern vans.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including the oil pan gasket, valve cover gaskets, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the vehicle, oil consumption, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the leak location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, misfires, and spark plug fouling. These symptoms are often caused by the AFM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Disable the AFM system with a tuner or replace the AFM lifters with non-AFM lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the solution chosen.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil pressure sensor, located at the rear of the engine, can fail. This results in inaccurate readings on the oil pressure gauge or a "check engine" light.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Knocking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or ticking noises coming from the top of the engine when cold. Usually caused by worn lifters.
    *   Solution: Replace the lifters in the engine
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: This transmission is known for occasionally shifting hard between gears, especially when cold.
    * Solution: Changing the transmission fluid and cleaning the valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $250-$500
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, or complete loss of forward movement.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially over bumps. Loose or sloppy steering.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load capacity, and potential for broken leaf springs, especially when heavily loaded.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs, often with upgraded or heavier-duty versions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door lock actuators can fail, causing the doors to not lock or unlock properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a short period, making it difficult to start the vehicle. This can be due to a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve replacing a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's ABS light comes on, and the ABS system may not function properly. This can lead to longer stopping distances during emergency braking.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty ABS sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300

**Summary**

The 2010 GMC Savana 1500 presents a range of potential issues spanning mechanical and electrical systems. Engine-related problems, particularly those involving AFM in the 5.3L V8 and oil leaks in the 4.3L V6, can lead to moderate to significant repair costs. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting and torque converter failure, also contribute to potential maintenance expenses. Suspension issues, electrical malfunctions, and rust are common issues with these vans as well. The severity and cost of these issues vary depending on the specific problem and the extent of damage. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and obtain a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
