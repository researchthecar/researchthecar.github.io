The 2002 GMC Savana 1500 is a full-size van known for its practicality and utility. Engine options included the 4.3L Vortec V6 (190 hp, 250 lb-ft torque), the 5.0L Vortec V8 (270 hp, 285 lb-ft torque), and the 5.7L Vortec V8 (255 hp, 330 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Savana's spaciousness and towing capability, but commonly dislike its fuel economy and dated interior.

**Engine**

**4.3L Vortec V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption without obvious leaks, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Often requires engine rebuild or replacement of piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Vortec V8**

*   **Distributor Wear**

**Summary**

The 2002 GMC Savana 1500, while a reliable workhorse, has its share of common issues. Engine issues, particularly oil consumption in the 5.0L and intake gasket leaks in the 4.3L, can be costly. The 4L60E transmission is also prone to problems. Suspension components like ball joints and idler/pitman arms wear out, affecting handling. Electrical issues such as fuel pump and ABS sensor failures can occur. Rust is a significant concern in certain areas. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as engine or transmission problems, can result in substantial repair bills. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and be aware of these potential pitfalls.
