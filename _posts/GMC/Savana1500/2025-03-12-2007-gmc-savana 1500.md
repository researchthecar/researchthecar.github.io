**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.8L V8**

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fluctuating or inaccurate oil pressure readings on the dashboard gauge. Check engine light might come on. May be due to bad oil pressure sensor or faulty oil pump.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, particularly at idle. Misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage can occur if the lifter completely fails.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed AFM lifters. Some owners opt to disable the AFM system entirely during the repair to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and if AFM is disabled)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips between gears, especially during acceleration. May also experience delayed or harsh shifts.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. Could also be a valve body issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ for rebuild or replacement; $500 - $1,500+ for valve body repair
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations, particularly at low speeds or during lockup. May also experience stalling or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hard Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts between gears. Can be caused by valve body issues or worn clutches.
    *   Solution: Valve body repair or replacement. Transmission rebuild may be necessary if clutches are worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ for valve body; $2,000 - $4,000+ for rebuild
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the van sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. May hear squeaking or popping noises from the rear suspension. Broken leaf springs are visually obvious.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per side (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per ball joint (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery goes dead overnight or within a few days of sitting. Can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. Common culprits include the radio, lights, or faulty relays.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the source of the drain. Can range from a simple relay replacement ($50 - $150) to more complex wiring repairs ($200 - $500+).

**Summary**

The 2007 GMC Savana 1500, while a capable and practical van, suffers from several common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 5.3L AFM lifters and oil pressure sensor, can be costly to repair. Transmission slipping is another significant concern. Suspension issues, such as leaf spring sagging and ball joint wear, are also common, especially in older vans. Electrical problems like battery drain and power window motor failure are also known. Rust on the rocker panels and wheel wells is also common. While some issues like oil pressure sensor replacement are relatively inexpensive, others like AFM lifter failure or transmission rebuild can be quite costly, making it important to thoroughly inspect any potential purchase.
