Symptoms include decreased engine performance, knocking or pinging noises, and check engine light illumination. The solution is to replace the knock sensor, which can cost between $200 - $500+.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission can slip, causing a loss of power and difficulty accelerating. Symptoms include delayed gear engagement, harsh shifts, and slipping while driving. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission, which can cost between $2,000 - $4,000+.
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing shuddering or vibration while driving. Symptoms include a lack of acceleration, a burning smell, and check engine light illumination. The solution is to replace the torque converter, which can cost between $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **Shift solenoid failure:** The shift solenoid can fail, preventing the transmission from shifting correctly. Symptoms include delayed or harsh shifts, lack of acceleration, and check engine light illumination. The solution is to replace the shift solenoid, which can cost between $300 - $800+.

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission fluid leaks:** The transmission can develop fluid leaks, causing a loss of fluid and potential damage to the transmission. Symptoms include visible leaks, low transmission fluid levels on the dipstick, and check engine light illumination. The solution is to replace the leaking component, such as a seal or gasket, which can cost between $200 - $600+.
* **Shift quality issues:** The transmission can experience shift quality issues, such as rough or delayed shifts. Symptoms include difficulty shifting, a lack of acceleration, and check engine light illumination. The solution is to have the transmission serviced or reprogrammed, which can cost between $200 - $500+.
* **Valve body failure:** The valve body can fail, preventing the transmission from shifting correctly. Symptoms include difficulty shifting, lack of acceleration, and check engine light illumination. The solution is to replace the valve body, which can cost between $1,000 - $2,000+.
