### Summary Verdict
The 2003 GMC Savana 1500 is generally considered a reliable vehicle for its intended purpose, especially when equipped with the V8 engines. The most common issues tend to be related to the intake manifold gaskets on V8 engines and potential wear on the 4L60-E transmission's torque converter clutch. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can also require attention due to the vehicle's load-carrying nature.
