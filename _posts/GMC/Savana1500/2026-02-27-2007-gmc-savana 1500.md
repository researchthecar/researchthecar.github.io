### Summary Verdict
The 2007 GMC Savana 1500 offers a capable platform for various needs, but it is not without its potential reliability concerns. Engines, particularly the 5.3L and 6.0L V8s, can be prone to Active Fuel Management (AFM) issues and intake manifold leaks. The 4-speed automatic transmission, especially the 4L60-E, may experience torque converter or solenoid problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, often traced to the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Exterior rust, particularly in harsh climates, and interior wear on seats and HVAC components are also noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these common issues are key to maintaining the Savana's functionality and value.
