### Summary Verdict
The 2002 GMC Savana 1500, particularly with the popular Vortec V8 engines, is generally a durable vehicle. However, common issues like intake manifold gasket leaks and potential transmission problems (especially the 4L60-E) require attention. Suspension components such as ball joints and leaf springs can wear over time due to the van's utility. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the instrument cluster and BCM, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on climate. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor are also prone to failure. Regular maintenance and addressing these specific potential issues proactively will contribute to the longevity and reliability of the Savana 1500.
