The 2.4L engine is the primary concern, with documented issues of oil consumption and timing chain problems that can lead to significant repair costs. The automatic transmission also shows some susceptibility to harsh shifting and leaks. However, the 3.6L V6 engine and other systems like suspension, exterior, and interior components generally perform reliably with no widespread issues reported. Electrical concerns, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. Prospective buyers should be particularly mindful of the 2.4L engine's history and ensure any pre-owned vehicle has a well-documented maintenance record.
