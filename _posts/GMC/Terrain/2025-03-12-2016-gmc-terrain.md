The 2016 GMC Terrain is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque and a 3.6L V6 producing 301 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Terrain's spacious interior and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints include the vehicle's somewhat sluggish acceleration with the 2.4L engine and some reported issues with reliability, particularly with the engine and electrical systems.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes an abnormal amount of oil between oil changes, sometimes requiring owners to add oil frequently. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage. White or blue smoke from the exhaust can also be present.
    *   Solution: GM released a technical service bulletin (TSB) regarding oil consumption in these engines. Updated piston rings and recalibrating the ECM/ECU can mitigate the issue. More severe cases may require a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to rough running, misfires, and a check engine light.  Rattling noises from the engine, especially on startup, are common indicators.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and potentially other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle stalls, loses power, and will not start. Check engine light will be on.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or erratic shifting between gears, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. Shuddering or vibrations can also be felt.
    *   Solution: A software update of the Transmission Control Module (TCM) might solve the issue. In more severe cases, transmission valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps.  Excessive bouncing and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front struts or shocks.  Often, it's recommended to replace both sides at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The battery drains overnight or within a short period, leading to a dead battery and inability to start the vehicle.
    *   Solution:  Diagnose and repair the parasitic draw. This could involve replacing a faulty module or repairing damaged wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, reboots unexpectedly, or experiences connectivity issues (Bluetooth, USB). Touchscreen becomes unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In other cases, the infotainment unit itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks (Sunroof)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, particularly around the headliner or A-pillars, after rain or car washes. Clogged sunroof drain tubes are usually the cause.
    * Solution: Clean or unclog the sunroof drain tubes. In some cases, the sunroof seal may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues (A/C)**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  A/C blows warm air or is not cold enough. Could be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution:  Diagnose the A/C system to identify the source of the problem. Repair any leaks, replace the compressor or blend door actuator as needed, and recharge the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2016 GMC Terrain has a mix of potential issues, with the 2.4L engine showing the most concerning problems like excessive oil consumption and timing chain issues which can be costly to repair. Transmission problems with harsh shifting can also occur with both engines. Other electrical and interior issues are less severe but still important to consider. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and perform a thorough inspection before purchasing.
