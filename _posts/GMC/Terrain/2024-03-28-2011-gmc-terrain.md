**Introduction**

The 2011 GMC Terrain is a compact SUV available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-four and a 3.0L V6. The 2.4L engine produces 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0L engine produces 264 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.

The Terrain has received praise for its comfortable interior, spacious cargo area, and fuel-efficient engines. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of power from the base engine, subpar handling, and limited rear-seat legroom.
