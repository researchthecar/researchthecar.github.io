The 2019 GMC Terrain is a compact SUV that offers a blend of style, comfort, and practicality. It came with three engine options: a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 170 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L turbodiesel inline-4 producing 137 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. The 1.5L and 2.0L engines were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L diesel was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Terrain for its comfortable ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and stylish interior. Common dislikes include its somewhat lackluster base engine performance, smaller cargo area compared to competitors, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, engine knocking, and visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: A revised PCV valve may help reduce the oil consumption, but in severe cases, piston ring replacement or even engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for PCV Valve, $2,000 - $5,000+ for piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Stalling**
  * Description/Symptoms: Engine may stall while idling or during low-speed maneuvers.
  * Solution: Could be caused by faulty mass airflow (MAF) sensor or crankshaft position sensor. Replacement is the usual fix.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
  * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **No Issues Found**

**1.6L Turbodiesel Inline-4**

* **DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The diesel particulate filter (DPF) can become clogged, leading to reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, and the DPF warning light illuminating. Frequent short trips can exacerbate this issue.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF, either through a dealer service or a diagnostic tool. In severe cases, DPF replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for forced regeneration, $1,000 - $3,000+ for DPF replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (paired with 1.5L and 2.0L engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during passing maneuvers has also been reported.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) software update may resolve some shifting issues. In other cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software update, $800 - $1500+ for valve body, $3,000 - $6,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 1.6L diesel engine)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced premature wear of the struts and shocks, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, particularly over rough roads. Noises such as clunking or rattling from the suspension components can also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per axle, depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In more severe cases, replacement of the infotainment system may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update, $500 - $1,500+ for infotainment system replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rapid battery drain, especially when the vehicle is not in use. Can cause the vehicle to not start.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and replacing the parasitic draw. The battery may also need to be replaced
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks (Sunroof/Tail Lights)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks can occur around the sunroof or tail lights, leading to water intrusion into the cabin or cargo area.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 GMC Terrain has some notable issues, primarily centered around the 1.5L engine's oil consumption and the 9-speed transmission's shifting performance. Diesel models can experience DPF clogs, and some owners report electrical and suspension issues. While some problems can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes, others, such as engine or transmission replacement, can be quite costly. The severity of these issues can range from annoying inconveniences to major mechanical failures, so it's important to be aware of them when considering a 2019 GMC Terrain.
