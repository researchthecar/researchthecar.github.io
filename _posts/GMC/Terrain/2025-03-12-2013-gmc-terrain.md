The 2013 GMC Terrain is a compact SUV that offered a balance of comfort and utility. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 generating 301 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Terrain for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.4L engine). Common complaints included the relatively weak base engine performance, some reliability concerns, and styling some found dated.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.4L engine in the 2013 GMC Terrain is known for consuming excessive amounts of oil. Symptoms include the "Check Engine" light illuminating, low oil level warnings, the need to frequently add oil between scheduled oil changes, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to replace the piston rings with an updated design. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The high-pressure fuel pump can experience failures that cause driveability issues, reduced engine power, and potentially a "Check Engine" light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the high-pressure fuel pump is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain on the 3.6L V6 can stretch or fail prematurely. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, a "Check Engine" light with codes related to timing, and potential engine misfires or stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners is the required repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: This issue can sometimes be addressed with a transmission fluid flush and software update. However, in many cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted premature wear of suspension components such as ball joints, control arm bushings, and struts/shocks. This can lead to noises such as clunking, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ (depending on the components needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning Power Liftgate**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate can experience issues with opening or closing properly, sometimes getting stuck or making unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair may involve replacing the liftgate struts, motor, latch mechanism, or related wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

    *   Solution: The solution involves diagnosing the cause of the airbag light using a diagnostic scanner and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: 13372 (NHTSA Recall Number)

**Summary**

The 2013 GMC Terrain can be a comfortable and practical SUV, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the 2.4L engine's excessive oil consumption, which can be costly to address. Other potential problems include timing chain issues on the 3.6L V6, transmission problems, and electrical issues. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, making a pre-purchase inspection crucial.
