Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2018 GMC Terrain, categorized by component and engine/transmission configuration, along with potential solutions and estimated costs.

The 2018 GMC Terrain is a compact SUV that offers a blend of comfort and practicality. While many owners appreciate its stylish design, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology, some have reported experiencing certain issues. Engine options for the 2018 Terrain included a 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder engine (170 hp and 203 lb-ft of torque), a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine (252 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque), and a 1.6L turbo-diesel four-cylinder engine (137 hp and 240 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Some common dislikes include smaller cargo space compared to rivals and some reported issues with the 9-speed transmission.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure warning light illuminating and the engine running roughly. This can sometimes be due to faulty piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, potential solutions range from replacing the PCV valve to a full engine rebuild or replacement. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV valve) - $5,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the engine has stalled while driving. This can lead to hazardous conditions and reduced vehicle control.
    *   Solution: The cause of stalling can be difficult to track down, so start with the basics such as spark plugs, fuel pump, fuel filter, and coils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the underlying issue
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation during acceleration or delayed engagement is also reported.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush. Some cases may require a software update (reprogramming the TCM - Transmission Control Module). In more severe cases, valve body replacement or full transmission replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
