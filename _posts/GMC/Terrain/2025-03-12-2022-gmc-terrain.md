**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the "low oil" warning light illuminating and noticeable drops on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve may help alleviate the issue. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for PCV valve replacement; $2,000 - $4,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported turbocharger failure, leading to a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling), and potentially the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm turbocharger failure. Replacement of the turbocharger assembly is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have described experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during low-speed maneuvers or when accelerating from a stop. Hesitation between gears can also occur.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or transmission control module (TCM) recalibration may resolve the issue. More serious cases may require valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for software update/TCM recalibration; $800 - $2,000+ for valve body replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, crash, or become unresponsive, requiring a reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate controls.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often released to address these issues. In some cases, replacing the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update; $500 - $1,500+ for infotainment unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic drain. Common causes include faulty modules (e.g., infotainment, OnStar), or a short in the wiring. Repair or replacement of the faulty component.

**Summary**

The 2022 GMC Terrain, while generally reliable, experiences some common issues. The engine, particularly the 1.5L turbo, can suffer from excessive oil consumption and turbocharger issues, potentially leading to significant repair costs. The 9-speed transmission sometimes exhibits harsh shifting. Electrical issues related to the infotainment system and battery drain are also reported. Overall, while the majority of owners have positive experiences, being aware of these potential problems can help prospective buyers make a more informed decision. The severity of the issues range from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars for software updates or sensor replacements to several thousand for engine or transmission repairs.
