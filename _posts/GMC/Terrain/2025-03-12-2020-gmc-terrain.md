The 2020 GMC Terrain is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable ride and stylish design. Engine options included a 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine delivering 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 1.5L engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.0L came with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Terrain's user-friendly infotainment system and its nimble handling. Some common dislikes include the smaller cargo space compared to some competitors and occasionally sluggish acceleration with the base engine.

**Engine**
