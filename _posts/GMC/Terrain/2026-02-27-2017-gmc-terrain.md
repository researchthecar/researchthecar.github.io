# 2017 GMC Terrain

### Overview
The 2017 GMC Terrain is a compact SUV that offered a comfortable ride and a practical interior for its segment. It was available with two engine options: a standard 2.4L naturally aspirated four-cylinder and an optional more powerful 3.6L V6. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. While generally considered a reliable vehicle for its model year, some owners have reported specific issues that are worth noting for potential buyers or current owners. These tend to be concentrated in areas like the powertrain and electrical systems, though many units perform without significant problems. Regular maintenance is key to ensuring the longevity of any vehicle, and the Terrain is no exception.

### Summary Verdict
The 2017 GMC Terrain is a generally dependable compact SUV, particularly if equipped with the 3.6L V6 engine, which appears to be more robust than the 2.4L four-cylinder. The primary concerns revolve around the 2.4L engine's tendency for oil consumption and potential timing chain issues, as well as the 6-speed automatic transmission's occasional problems with shifting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, can also arise. While these issues are documented, they do not affect all vehicles, and many 2017 Terrains operate without significant mechanical or electrical faults. Prospective buyers should consider a pre-purchase inspection, paying close attention to the engine and transmission health.
