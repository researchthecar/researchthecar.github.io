The 2015 GMC Terrain is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. Engine options include a 2.4L Inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 generating 301 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Terrain for its comfortable seats, quiet cabin, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints include the 2.4L engine's fuel economy not meeting expectations, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report higher than normal oil consumption, sometimes requiring a quart of oil to be added every 1,000 miles or less. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored and addressed. Blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell, are also possible symptoms.
    *   Solution: The most common fix is to replace the piston rings with an updated design and inspect the cylinders for wear, sometimes requiring engine replacement. The PCV valve and valve cover gasket should also be inspected.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the severity of the damage and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: 17V099000

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Stretching of the timing chain can lead to engine misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light with codes related to timing issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially the camshaft sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic or harsh shifting between gears, particularly when cold. Slipping during acceleration or difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, replacement of the valve body or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and noises (clunking, rattling) coming from the suspension, especially over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per axle (depending on parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially overnight. The vehicle may require frequent jump starts or a new battery. This is often tied to the MyLink system or other electrical components not fully shutting down.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic drain (often requires a multimeter and electrical knowledge). Possible fixes include replacing the battery, repairing/replacing faulty electrical components, or updating software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (battery replacement) - $500+ (electrical diagnosis and repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **MyLink Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and system reboots.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset, software update (if available), or in some cases, the MyLink module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/update) - $800+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks (Sunroof/Liftgate)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin from the sunroof or around the liftgate area. This can lead to mold and mildew buildup.
    *   Solution: Clean and reseal the sunroof drain tubes or replace the weather stripping around the liftgate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity and location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Requires diagnosis of the airbag system using a diagnostic scanner to identify the faulty component (clockspring, seatbelt pretensioner, etc.). Repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: 16V649000

**Summary**

The 2015 GMC Terrain, particularly models equipped with the 2.4L engine, can suffer from oil consumption and timing chain issues, which can be costly to repair. Other common problems include transmission issues, electrical problems, and water leaks. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant repair bills. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
