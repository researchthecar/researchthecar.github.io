The 2024 GMC Terrain is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable ride and a stylish exterior. It comes standard with a 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the Terrain's user-friendly infotainment system and spacious interior for its class, some common criticisms include its relatively uninspiring acceleration and the lack of more powerful engine options.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged I4 (LYX)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. Symptoms can include the low oil pressure warning light illuminating, engine knocking, and eventual engine damage if not addressed. This is sometimes related to PCV valve issues, or piston ring issues.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can diagnose piston ring issues. Replacement of the piston rings, or in severe cases, engine replacement may be required. Replacing the PCV valve may address issues related to oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for PCV valve, $2,500 - $5,000+ for piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, whistling noises from the engine bay, and potential check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm turbocharger failure. Replacement of the turbocharger is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (9T45)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when accelerating, particularly during shifts between gears. Jerky or clunky gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can alleviate the problem. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or full transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid flush and software update, $800 - $1,500+ for valve body replacement, $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration. May be accompanied by unusual noises from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension when driving over bumps, uneven tire wear, and a general feeling of looseness in the suspension. This can affect ball joints, tie rod ends, and struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Inspection of suspension components and replacement of worn parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per component (ball joints, tie rod ends, struts/shocks) depending on the part and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, and connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates may address some issues. In some cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update (if available), $500 - $1,500+ for infotainment unit replacement.

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle battery draining overnight or within a few days of being parked, difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic drain. Could be related to faulty modules or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the diagnosis and the cost of the faulty component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks in the Tailgate Area**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water intrusion into the cargo area after rain or car washes. Dampness or visible water pooling inside the vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2024 GMC Terrain can have issues ranging from relatively minor infotainment glitches to more serious engine and transmission problems. Oil consumption and transmission issues appear to be the most significant concerns, potentially leading to expensive repairs. While many issues can be resolved with relatively inexpensive fixes like software updates or fluid changes, more severe problems like turbocharger failure or engine replacement can be very costly. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and condition before purchasing.
