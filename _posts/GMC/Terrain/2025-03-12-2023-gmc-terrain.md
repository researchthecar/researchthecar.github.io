The 2023 GMC Terrain is a compact SUV known for its comfortable ride, user-friendly technology, and stylish design. It offers a single engine option: a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 175 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Terrain's fuel efficiency and spacious interior, but some criticize its relatively low horsepower and the responsiveness of the automatic transmission. Common dislikes also include the sometimes underwhelming acceleration and the perceived value proposition compared to competitors.
