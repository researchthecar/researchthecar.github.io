**Introduction:**
The 2020 GMC Terrain is a compact crossover SUV that offers a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and advanced technology features. It is powered by a standard 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 engine with 170 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. For those seeking more power, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine is available, producing 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission. Despite its positive attributes, the 2020 GMC Terrain has been plagued by a number of issues.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**
- **Turbocharger Failure:** Symptoms include a lack of power, excessive exhaust smoke, and decreased fuel economy. The solution involves replacing the turbocharger and its associated components, costing approximately $1,500 - $2,500+.
- **Fuel Injector Issues:** Misfiring and rough idling are common signs of fuel injector problems. The injectors may need to be replaced, which typically costs around $300 - $500+ per injector.

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**
- **Valve Train Noise:** The engine may produce a ticking or rattling sound due to excessive clearance in the valve train. Adjusting the valve clearances or replacing the affected components can resolve the issue, costing approximately $500 - $1,000+.

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission**
- **Shifting Issues:** Hesitation, delayed shifts, or harsh engagements when transitioning between gears may indicate transmission problems. Software updates, transmission fluid flushes, or component replacements may be necessary, with costs varying depending on the extent of the issue.
- **Slipping:** Loss of power and difficulty maintaining speed are indicative of a slipping transmission. Repairing or rebuilding the transmission is often the solution, costing approximately $2,000 - $4,000+.

**Suspension**

- **Strut Failure:** A rattling or knocking sound when driving over bumps, along with reduced handling and stability, can be caused by worn or faulty struts. Replacement of the struts and associated hardware typically costs around $500 - $1,000+ per strut.

**Electrical**

- **Battery Draining:** An electrical drain may cause the battery to lose power over time, resulting in difficulty starting or electrical system malfunctions. Identifying and repairing the source of the drain, such as faulty wiring or parasitic components, can resolve the issue.
- **Headlight Issues:** Dim or flickering headlights may be due to electrical problems with the wiring, bulbs, or control modules. Troubleshooting and replacing the affected components is necessary, costing approximately $100 - $500+ per headlight.

**Exterior**

- **Rear Bumper Gaps:** Uneven gaps between the rear bumper and body panel can be a cosmetic issue that affects the appearance of the vehicle. Realignment or replacement of the bumper or body panel may be required, costing around $200 - $500+ for the parts and labor.

**Interior**

- **Climate Control Malfunctions:** Inoperative or erratic functioning of the climate control system, such as incorrect temperature settings or fan speed issues, may be caused by faulty sensors, actuators, or control modules. Replacing the affected components or reprogramming the control module can resolve the problem.
- **Sunroof Leaks:** Water leaking into the cabin from the sunroof can occur due to clogged drains or faulty seals. Cleaning the drains, repairing leaks, or replacing the sunroof assembly may be necessary, costing approximately $500 - $1,500+.

**Summary:**
The 2020 GMC Terrain faces a range of issues that vary in severity and cost to repair. Engine problems, such as turbocharger failures and fuel injector concerns, are prevalent. Transmission issues, including shifting problems and slipping, can also be expensive to resolve. Suspension and electrical issues add to the list of potential headaches. While some interior issues, such as climate control malfunctions and sunroof leaks, may be less severe, they can still impact the overall comfort and convenience of the vehicle. The severity and cost of these issues should be carefully considered before purchasing or owning a 2020 GMC Terrain.
