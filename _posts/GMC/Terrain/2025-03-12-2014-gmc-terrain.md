Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2014 GMC Terrain, formatted for your website and based on available data.

The 2014 GMC Terrain is a compact SUV known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque and a 3.6L V6 making 301 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Terrain for its fuel economy (especially with the 2.4L), quiet cabin, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include reported engine problems and perceived lack of responsiveness from the 2.4L engine, and some styling elements.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 (LE9)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the engine consuming an abnormally high amount of oil, sometimes requiring a quart every 1,000 miles or less. This can lead to low oil levels, engine damage, and potential catalytic converter failure due to oil entering the exhaust system. The vehicle may emit blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: A redesigned piston and piston ring assembly along with recalibration of the engine control module (ECM) to improve oil consumption.  Some owners may need to replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ (depending on if only the pistons are replaced or if the catalytic converter needs replacing).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The timing chain stretches or breaks, causing the engine to run poorly, misfire, or stall. This can be caused by the aforementioned oil consumption issue and infrequent oil changes.  A rattling noise may be heard from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.  Inspection of the engine for further damage is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6 (LFX)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70/6T75)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The transmission exhibits hard or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears.  The transmission may also slip, causing the engine RPM to rise without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. Some owners also report the vehicle shifting hard or slipping into neutral while driving.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician to determine the root cause. This could involve a transmission fluid flush, replacement of faulty solenoids, valve body repair, or complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Owners have reported issues with worn-out struts, shocks, ball joints, and tie rod ends at relatively low mileage.  Symptoms include clunking noises from the suspension, uneven tire wear, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components. An alignment is typically recommended after replacing suspension parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner (depending on the components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning Power Liftgate**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, may open or close on its own, or may get stuck in either the open or closed position. This can be caused by a faulty liftgate motor, latch assembly, or control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician to determine the faulty component.  Replacement of the liftgate motor, latch assembly, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Problems with the radio or infotainment system, including freezing, crashing, blank screens, and loss of functionality (e.g., no sound, navigation issues).
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the infotainment screen, or replacement of the entire radio unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $1,000+ (radio replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight. This is a common issue with many vehicles from this era due to the type of plastics used.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 GMC Terrain has some notable issues, primarily centered around the 2.4L engine's oil consumption problems, which can lead to more significant engine damage. Transmission problems and electrical issues are also reported. The cost of repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to more substantial expenses for engine or transmission work. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect any used Terrain they are considering, paying particular attention to the engine's oil consumption and the transmission's shifting behavior.
