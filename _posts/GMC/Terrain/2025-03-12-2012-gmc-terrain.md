Common complaints revolve around engine issues, particularly with the 2.4L engine, and some transmission concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported excessive oil consumption, sometimes requiring oil to be added between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored closely. Visible blue smoke may be seen from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: General Motors issued a service bulletin and extended warranty coverage for certain 2010-2017 model year vehicles with the 2.4L engine, including the 2012 Terrain, to address this issue. The fix involves a revised piston ring design, and potentially replacing the pistons and other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: Recall #1600770 - Excessive Oil Consumption - GM Customer Satisfaction Program

*   **Timing Chain Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or break, leading to engine misfires, rough running, and potentially severe engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and potentially related components such as the camshaft sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution can range from a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement to a complete transmission rebuild or replacement. In some cases, reprogramming the transmission control module (TCM) may help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the struts and shocks wear out prematurely, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, particularly over bumps or rough roads.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 (per axle)
     * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining overnight or within a short period, even with the vehicle turned off. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve replacing a faulty module, accessory, or wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
