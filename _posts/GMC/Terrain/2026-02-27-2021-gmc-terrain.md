### Summary Verdict
The 2021 GMC Terrain generally demonstrates good reliability, with its powertrain components being a strong point. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the 1.5L turbocharged engine's tendency for oil dilution, which is often addressable with software updates. The 9-speed automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit minor hesitation or shuddering, usually resolved by recalibration. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system's responsiveness and occasional premature battery failure, are also noted.
