The 1994 GMC K3500 is a heavy-duty pickup truck that was available with several engine and transmission options. It was a popular choice for commercial and personal use due to its durability and towing capacity. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common problems that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

* **6.5L Turbocharged Diesel**
    * **Fuel Injector Failure:** Fuel injectors can become clogged or fail, causing rough idling, decreased power, and black smoke from the exhaust. Repair involves replacing the injectors, which typically costs $600-$1,200.
    * **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail due to oil leaks or wear, resulting in reduced power and increased fuel consumption. A new turbocharger and installation typically cost $1,500-$2,500.
    * **Cylinder Head Gasket Failure:** Cylinder head gaskets can fail, causing coolant and oil leaks, overheating, and white smoke from the exhaust. Repairing a head gasket typically involves removing the cylinder head and replacing the gasket, costing around $1,000-$2,000.
* **7.4L Vortec V8**
    * **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant leaks and overheating. Replacing the gasket typically costs $500-$800.

    * **Clutch Failure:** The clutch can wear out or fail, causing difficulty engaging gears or slipping. Replacing a clutch typically costs $600-$1,000.
    * **Synchronizer Wear:** Synchronizers can wear out, leading to grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears. Repair involves replacing the worn synchronizers, which typically costs $400-$600.

**Suspension**

* **Ball Joint Failure:** Ball joints can wear out or fail, causing loose steering and clunking noises. Replacing ball joints typically costs $300-$500 per side.
* **Leaf Spring Failure:** Leaf springs can break or sag, affecting ride height and handling. Replacing leaf springs typically costs $500-$800.
* **Shock Absorber Failure:** Shock absorbers can wear out or leak, reducing ride comfort and handling. Replacing shock absorbers typically costs $200-$300 per pair.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Failure:** Batteries can fail due to age or extreme temperatures, causing difficulty starting the vehicle. A new battery typically costs $100-$200.
