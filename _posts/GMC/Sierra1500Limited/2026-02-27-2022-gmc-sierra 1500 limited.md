### Summary Verdict
The 2022 GMC Sierra 1500 Limited generally presents good reliability, especially with the V8 gasoline engines. The 5.3L V8 has a known, albeit not universal, issue with its Active Fuel Management system that can lead to costly repairs if not addressed. The Duramax diesel, while efficient, can experience DPF regeneration problems, particularly if the truck is used primarily for short trips. The 10-speed automatic transmission is mostly reliable but can exhibit shifting anomalies requiring software updates or service. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and intermittent battery drain, are present but not overwhelmingly common. The Multi-Pro tailgate, a popular feature, can occasionally develop mechanical or electrical faults. Overall, the Sierra 1500 Limited is a dependable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific potential issues, especially when considering the 5.3L engine or the diesel variant.
