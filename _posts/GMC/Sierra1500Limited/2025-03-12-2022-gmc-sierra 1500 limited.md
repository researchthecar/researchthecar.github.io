Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 GMC Sierra 1500 Limited, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration.  The 2022 GMC Sierra 1500 Limited was a transition year, essentially a carry-over of the pre-facelifted 2019-2021 model while the updated 2022 Sierra was being launched.  It offered several engine options including a 2.7L Turbo, a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8, and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel. Transmission options typically included an 8-speed automatic (primarily with the 2.7L and 5.3L) and a 10-speed automatic (primarily with the 6.2L and 3.0L).  Owners generally appreciate the Sierra's comfortable ride, strong towing capability (especially with the V8s and diesel), and available technology.  Common dislikes include the pre-refresh interior styling (in the Limited), some reported reliability concerns, and the price compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.7L Turbo**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling or whining noises from the engine, check engine light.  Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
