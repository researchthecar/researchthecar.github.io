The 2019 GMC Sierra 1500 Limited is a carryover model from the previous generation, offered alongside the redesigned 2019 Sierra 1500. While buyers appreciate its more traditional styling and often find better deals compared to the newer model, some criticize its older technology and less refined interior. The 2019 Sierra Limited offered several engine choices. The base engine is a 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 producing 285 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque. Upgrades include a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic (4.3L and some 5.3L models) and an 8-speed automatic (5.3L and 6.2L models). Common owner complaints include issues with the transmission (especially the 8-speed), electrical glitches, and some concerns about engine reliability.

**Engine**

**4.3L EcoTec3 V6**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This engine has Active Fuel Management (AFM), which shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy. AFM lifters can fail, causing misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. Symptoms may include a check engine light, ticking noises from the engine, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners opt for a full AFM delete.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.3L V6, the 5.3L V8 also utilizes AFM and can suffer from lifter failure, leading to misfires, rough idling, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM delete is also a common choice.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 engines experience excessive oil consumption. This may be due to issues with the Piston Rings. This can be accelerated by the AFM system as well.
    * Solution: Some owners report success with using higher viscosity oil or specific additives. More extensive repairs may involve replacing piston rings or the entire engine in severe cases. An AFM Delete will also prevent this from occuring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 also utilizes AFM and can suffer from lifter failure, leading to misfires, rough idling, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM delete is also a common choice.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6L80)**

*   No Issues Found

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8L90 transmission is known for harsh shifting, shuddering, and general roughness, particularly at lower speeds. Some owners describe a "clunking" sensation when shifting. This is often attributed to the transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with the updated Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP fluid (Blue Label) designed to address these issues. In some cases, a valve body replacement or full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates or, in some cases, replacement of the infotainment system module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,200+ (depending on warranty coverage and severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the backup camera, including a black screen, distorted image, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connection. Update the infotainment system software. Replace the camera unit or the camera module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Bed Rusting (Rare)**
    * Description/Symptoms: There are rare reports of rust forming on the truck bed, particularly around seams or welds.
    * Solution: Sanding down the affected area and applying rust-inhibiting paint or coating. In severe cases, bed replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 GMC Sierra 1500 Limited, while appealing to some due to its familiarity and potentially lower cost compared to the redesigned model, has its share of issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the AFM lifter failure in the engines and the 8-speed transmission's harsh shifting. Electrical issues, such as infotainment glitches, are also common. While some issues are relatively minor, engine and transmission problems can lead to substantial repair costs, making thorough inspection and a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's history crucial before purchase.
