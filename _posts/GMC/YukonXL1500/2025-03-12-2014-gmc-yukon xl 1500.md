*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often linked to the AFM system, is a common complaint. Drivers may notice the need to add oil frequently between oil changes.
    *   Solution: AFM disable via tuning and possibly cylinder head replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ depending on the repair type.
