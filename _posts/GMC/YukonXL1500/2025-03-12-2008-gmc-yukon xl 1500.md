The 2008 GMC Yukon XL 1500 is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 4.8L V8, a 5.3L V8 (available in several variants), and a 6.0L V8. The 5.3L V8, a popular choice, produces around 320 horsepower and 340 lb-ft of torque depending on the exact configuration (iron block vs aluminum block). People often appreciate the Yukon XL's ability to haul large families and cargo, as well as its relatively smooth highway cruising. Common complaints include lower-than-expected fuel economy, potential issues with Active Fuel Management (AFM) on some 5.3L engines, and certain electrical gremlins.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**5.3L V8 (Aluminum Block)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, misfires, reduced power, and potentially catastrophic engine damage. This is due to the AFM lifters collapsing, preventing valves from opening or closing properly.
    *   Solution: Replace all lifters with updated (non-AFM) lifters, replace the cam shaft with a non-AFM cam, and disable AFM through a custom tune. Can also replace faulty lifters with OEM AFM lifters but risk a repeat failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often exceeding 1 quart every 1,000 miles. May also include blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Options range from replacing valve seals to a complete engine rebuild or replacement. Some have success with using a thicker oil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8 (Iron Block)**

**Summary**

The 2008 GMC Yukon XL 1500, while a capable SUV, has its share of potential issues. The most serious and costly problems often revolve around the 5.3L V8 engine, particularly with AFM lifter failure and excessive oil consumption. Transmission issues, specifically with the 6L80E, can also be expensive to address. Suspension and electrical problems are also common, though generally less costly. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and be aware of these potential issues. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify any existing or impending problems. While the Yukon XL offers great utility, be prepared for potential maintenance costs.
