The 2009 GMC Yukon XL 1500 is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capability. Engine options include a 4.8L V8 (295 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (320 hp, 340 lb-ft of torque; some models with Active Fuel Management), and a 6.2L V8 (403 hp, 417 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options are primarily a 4-speed automatic and a 6-speed automatic (on some models with the 6.2L V8). Owners often appreciate the Yukon XL's large cargo area and passenger capacity. However, some common complaints include fuel economy, issues with Active Fuel Management (AFM), and the vehicle's overall size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**
* **No Issues Found**

**5.3L V8**

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced power, and possible engine damage. The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but the lifters can fail, causing these issues.
    * Solution: Replace the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft if damaged. A common fix is to delete the AFM system altogether by replacing the camshaft, lifters, and ECM tuning to prevent future failures.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs. This can be caused by worn piston rings, faulty valve stem seals, or AFM system issues.
    * Solution: Diagnose the cause of oil consumption. If the piston rings or valve stem seals are worn, they need to be replaced. Addressing AFM issues may also help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8**
* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4L60E)**
* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, slipping during acceleration, or complete failure to shift. These issues often stem from worn clutches, valve body problems, or a failing torque converter.
    * Solution: Diagnose the source of the problem. Common fixes include replacing the valve body, rebuilding the transmission, or replacing the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (6L80E)**
* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4L60E, this transmission can experience harsh or delayed shifting, and slipping.
    * Solution: Diagnose the cause of the shifting problem. Common solutions include replacing solenoids or completely rebuilding the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, a warning light on the dash, and the compressor failing to inflate the air springs.
    * Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor. It's often recommended to replace the air springs at the same time if they are also leaking.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Autoride Shock Absorber Failure (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Poor ride quality, excessive bouncing, and a warning light on the dash.
    * Solution: Replace the Autoride shock absorbers. These shocks are electronically controlled, making them more expensive than standard shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per axle
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gauges flickering, failing to read correctly, or completely dying. This is a common problem with this generation of GM trucks and SUVs.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster. Some shops specialize in repairing these clusters.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to lock or unlock, or making a clicking noise when activated.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2009 GMC Yukon XL 1500 has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant problems are related to the 5.3L engine's Active Fuel Management system and potential transmission issues in both the 4-speed and 6-speed automatics. Suspension problems such as air compressor and Autoride shock failures can also be costly to repair. Electrical issues like instrument cluster failures and door lock actuator problems are also relatively common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
