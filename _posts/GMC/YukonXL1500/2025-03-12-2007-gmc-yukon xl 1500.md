The 2007 GMC Yukon XL 1500 is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Available engine options included the 4.8L V8 (295 hp and 305 lb-ft of torque), the 5.3L V8 (320 hp and 340 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.0L V8 (366 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque). All engine options were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Yukon XL for its ability to haul large families and cargo, as well as its relatively smooth ride. Common complaints center around fuel economy, the aging 4-speed transmission, and some reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and potential loss of power. This issue is related to the AFM system that deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. Lifters can collapse, causing damage to the camshaft.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or the entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and chosen solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 GMC Yukon XL 1500, while a capable and spacious SUV, is prone to several common issues. Engine-related problems, especially those linked to the AFM system and oil consumption, are significant and potentially costly. Transmission issues, primarily with the 4L60E, can also be expensive to address. Suspension problems, particularly with the air suspension and Autoride systems (if equipped), add to the potential maintenance burden. Electrical and interior issues, while generally less severe, can still be frustrating. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used Yukon XL 1500 before purchasing it. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
