The 2004 GMC Yukon XL 1500 is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options for this model year include the 4.8L V8 (285 hp, 295 lb-ft torque), the 5.3L V8 (295 hp, 335 lb-ft torque), and the 6.0L V8 (325 hp, 365 lb-ft torque). It came with the 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its versatility for hauling cargo and passengers but frequently cite issues related to age and component wear as it is now 20 years old. Some common complaints revolve around electrical gremlins, drivetrain issues, and general maintenance costs associated with an older vehicle.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be indicated by blue smoke from the exhaust and a noticeable drop in the oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: The cause can vary, but common fixes include replacing the valve stem seals, piston rings, or addressing issues with the PCV system. A compression test can help diagnose the source of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+, depending on the source and severity of the consumption.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or pinging noises, especially under acceleration, may indicate pre-ignition or detonation. This can be caused by carbon buildup, faulty knock sensors, or using low-octane fuel.
    *   Solution: Using higher-octane fuel, cleaning the fuel injectors and intake system, replacing the knock sensors, or addressing carbon buildup can help resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L, some 5.3L engines exhibit excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs.
    *   Solution: The fix is similar to the 4.8L: replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or addressing PCV system issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+, depending on the source and severity of the consumption.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **"Ticking" Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking noise, often described as a lifter tick, can be present, especially at idle or low speeds. This is sometimes attributed to worn lifters or exhaust manifold bolts.
    *   Solution: Replacing the lifters or exhaust manifold bolts/gaskets can resolve the ticking noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+, depending on the specific repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    *   Solution: The cause can vary, but common fixes include replacing the valve stem seals, piston rings, or addressing issues with the PCV system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+, depending on the source and severity of the consumption.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.0L engine can experience cooling system issues, such as overheating or coolant leaks. This can be due to a failing water pump, thermostat, radiator, or hoses.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty components, such as the water pump, thermostat, radiator, or hoses, will resolve the cooling system issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the component and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping/Hard Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4L60E is prone to slipping between gears, particularly in older vehicles or those with high mileage. Hard or erratic shifting can also occur.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might help initially. However, often a rebuild or replacement of the transmission is required. Valve body issues are also common.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the torque converter, such as shuddering or vibrations, especially at highway speeds. This can indicate a failing torque converter clutch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Yukon XLs equipped with air suspension can experience issues such as sagging, failure to maintain ride height, or compressor failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air springs, compressor, or ride height sensors can fix these issues. Converting to a traditional coil spring suspension is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+, depending on the components replaced and whether a conversion is performed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: These components wear out over time, leading to loose steering, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints and tie rod ends is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the components replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common issues include gauges that stop working, erratic readings, or a completely dead instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument cluster is usually required. Some shops specialize in rebuilding these clusters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+, depending on whether the cluster is repaired or replaced.
    *   Recalls: **Recall Number: 07V019000** (Applicable to certain vehicles) This recall involves the instrument panel cluster losing illumination and/or intermittent/complete failure of the gauges and the PRNDL display.

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows and door locks can fail intermittently or completely, often due to faulty switches or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the switches or repairing the wiring is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per window/lock, depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found
