### Summary Verdict
The 2010 GMC Yukon XL 1500 is a robust vehicle with a generally good reliability record for its class and age. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the V8 engines, which can lead to oil consumption and internal engine wear if not addressed. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear over time, and if equipped, air suspension systems may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as power window failures and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon. Overall, while not immune to problems, most issues are repairable and often related to mileage and age. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can significantly extend the life and reliability of the Yukon XL 1500.
