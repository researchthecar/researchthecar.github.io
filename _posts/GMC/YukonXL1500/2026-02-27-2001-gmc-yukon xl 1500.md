### Summary Verdict
The 2001 GMC Yukon XL 1500 is a capable and generally reliable full-size SUV, particularly for its intended purpose of hauling and towing. The most common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, specifically the 4L60-E transmission's torque converter and solenoids, and potential leaks from the engine's intake manifold and oil cooler lines. Electrical components like the BCM and alternator can also be points of concern. Suspension wear, particularly ball joints and wheel bearings, is expected with age and mileage.
