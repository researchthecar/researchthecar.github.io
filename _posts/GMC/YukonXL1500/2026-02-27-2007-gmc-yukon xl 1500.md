### Summary Verdict
The 2007 GMC Yukon XL 1500 is a capable and generally reliable large SUV, especially concerning its core powertrain components like the 5.3L and 6.0L V8 engines and the 4-speed automatic transmissions. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as Active Fuel Management lifter problems and oil consumption on the 5.3L, and torque converter shudder on the 4L60-E transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM, and wear on suspension components like ball joints are also points to inspect. Rust can be a concern on older models. Overall, with diligent maintenance and inspection of these known weak points, the Yukon XL 1500 can remain a dependable vehicle.
