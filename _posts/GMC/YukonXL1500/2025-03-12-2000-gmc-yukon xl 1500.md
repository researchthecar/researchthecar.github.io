The 2000 GMC Yukon XL 1500 is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and truck-based durability. Engine options included the 5.3L Vortec V8 (285 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque), the 5.7L Vortec V8 (255 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.0L Vortec V8 (300 hp and 360 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with the 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Yukon XL's large cargo area, comfortable ride, and ability to haul passengers and cargo. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, age-related component failures, and the vehicle's overall size, which can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.
