# 2023 GMC Hummer EV

### Overview
The 2023 GMC Hummer EV represents a significant leap in electric vehicle technology, offering unparalleled off-road capability and performance. As a first-generation model of this resurrected icon, early reliability data is still emerging. However, initial reports suggest a generally robust platform, with most reported issues being minor or related to the complex integrated systems. The advanced electric powertrain and unique features, such as the CrabWalk mode and Extract Mode suspension, are generally performing as expected, though some software glitches have been noted. Owners are advised to stay updated on software, as many potential issues are resolved through over-the-air updates. The vehicle's construction and materials are premium, contributing to a solid feel, but as with any new, highly complex vehicle, some early adopter adjustments are to be anticipated.
