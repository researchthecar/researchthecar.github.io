The 2017 McLaren 720S is a high-performance supercar known for its breathtaking speed and innovative design. It's powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 710 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque, coupled with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. There are no other engine or transmission options available. Owners often praise the car's incredible acceleration, agile handling, and stunning looks. However, some common complaints revolve around the car's reliability, particularly electrical glitches and hydraulic system issues, as well as the high cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**4.0L Twin-Turbocharged V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks originating from various engine seals and gaskets, often manifesting as visible oil drips or burning oil smells.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty seals and gaskets with updated versions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the leak's location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature turbo failure, boost fluctuations, whistling noises, or decreased engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty turbocharger(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $15,000+ depending on if one or both turbos need replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Clutch Slippage/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during gear changes, jerky acceleration, transmission slipping, or complete failure to engage gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission requires a hydraulic pump to build the pressure needed to shift gears. When this pump fails, the transmission will have difficulty shifting gears, or completely lose the ability to shift gears.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty hydraulic pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Hydraulic Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 720S uses a sophisticated hydraulic suspension system (Proactive Chassis Control II). This system can experience leaks, causing ride height to drop, uneven handling, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing leaking hydraulic components (dampers, accumulators, or lines).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $10,000+ depending on the failed component and how many need replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors (e.g., oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors) can fail, leading to engine performance issues, error codes, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience freezing, slow response times, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Software updates, or replacing the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dihedral doors have issues with opening and closing due to malfunctioning actuators or sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty actuators or sensors, and/or lubricating hinges.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: AC system failure, weak airflow, or inconsistent cooling.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing components such as the compressor, condenser, or refrigerant lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 McLaren 720S, while delivering exceptional performance, can suffer from a range of issues. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger problems can lead to costly repairs. The transmission's dual-clutch system and hydraulic pump are also prone to failure. Electrical glitches and hydraulic suspension problems can further contribute to ownership costs. The severity of these issues can vary, but owners should be prepared for potentially expensive repairs. Overall, prospective buyers need to factor in the high maintenance and potential repair costs associated with owning a complex supercar like the 720S.
