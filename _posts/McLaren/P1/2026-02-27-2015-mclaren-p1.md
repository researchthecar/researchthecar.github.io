### Summary Verdict
The 2015 McLaren P1 is a hypercar built to extreme standards, and as such, its reliability is generally very good for its class. The most common and significant issues tend to revolve around the complex hybrid powertrain, particularly the battery pack and its associated control systems, as well as potential issues with the dual-clutch transmission's mechatronic unit. While rare, these repairs are exceptionally expensive due to the specialized nature of the vehicle and its components. Other systems like suspension, electrical, and exterior/interior components are typically robust, with only isolated reports of minor electronic glitches or specific component failures. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for preserving the P1's performance and reliability.
