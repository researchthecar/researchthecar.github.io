### Summary Verdict
The 2017 McLaren 570GT exhibits a generally good reliability record for a supercar, with most reported issues being specific to high-performance components. The twin-turbo V8 engine and dual-clutch transmission are the primary areas where owners might encounter technical problems, such as wastegate actuators, oil cooler leaks, clutch actuators, and mechatronics unit faults. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Suspension and exterior/interior components are less prone to significant issues. As with any exotic vehicle, maintenance costs are high, and specialized repair expertise is essential.
