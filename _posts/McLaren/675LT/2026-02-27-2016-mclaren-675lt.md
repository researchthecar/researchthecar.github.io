## Engine

### 3.8L Twin-Turbocharged V8
**Turbocharger Wastegate Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced engine power, boost pressure fluctuations, check engine light.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the faulty wastegate actuator. In some cases, turbocharger assembly may need replacement.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,000

**Oil Cooler Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil leaks around the engine bay, potential for oil in coolant, low oil level warnings.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the oil cooler and associated seals. Thorough cleaning of affected areas.
- **Cost:** $1,200 - $2,500


## Transmission

### 7-Speed Dual-Clutch (SSG)
**Clutch Actuator Malfunction**
- **Symptoms:** Erratic gear changes, difficulty engaging gears, transmission warning lights, limp mode.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and recalibration of the transmission control module. Replacement of faulty clutch actuators or hydraulic pump.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $4,500

**Mechatronic Unit Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission performance degradation, incorrect gear selection, potential for complete transmission failure.
- **Solution:** Repair or replacement of the mechatronic unit. Software updates may be required.
- **Cost:** $3,000 - $6,000


## Suspension

### Proactive Chassis Control (PCC) II
**Hydraulic Fluid Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Stiff ride, uneven ride height, warning lights related to suspension system, visible fluid leaks.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of leaking hydraulic lines, seals, or actuators. Refilling and bleeding the hydraulic system.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $2,500


## Electrical

### Infotainment System
**Screen Freezing/Unresponsiveness**
- **Symptoms:** Touchscreen becomes unresponsive, system freezes, audio or navigation malfunctions.

### Summary Verdict
The 2016 McLaren 675LT is a remarkable supercar with a generally strong reliability record for its class. However, owners should be aware of potential issues related to the complex twin-turbocharged V8 engine, particularly wastegate actuators and oil cooler seals. The sophisticated dual-clutch transmission can also present challenges, with clutch actuators and mechatronic units being areas to monitor. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are not uncommon in high-tech vehicles of this era. Exterior carbon fiber panels may require attention for clear coat issues, and interior Alcantara trim can show wear over time. Proactive maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are crucial for maintaining the 675LT's performance and value.
