## Engine

### 3.8L Twin-Turbocharged V8
**Turbocharger Wastegate Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced engine power, boost pressure warning lights, unusual noises from the turbo area.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the faulty wastegate actuator. In some cases, turbocharger unit replacement may be necessary.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,000

**Oil Cooler Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil leaks around the engine bay, low oil level warnings, potential for oil in coolant.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the leaking oil cooler and associated seals. Thorough cleaning of affected areas.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1,800


## Transmission

### 7-Speed Dual-Clutch (SSG)
**Clutch Actuator Malfunction**
- **Symptoms:** Erratic gear changes, difficulty engaging gears, transmission warning lights, slipping clutches.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and recalibration of the clutch actuator. Replacement of the actuator if faulty.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $4,500

**Mechatronic Unit Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission fault messages, incorrect gear selection, failure to shift.
- **Solution:** Software updates or replacement of the mechatronic control unit.
- **Cost:** $3,000 - $6,000


## Suspension

### Proactive Chassis Control II (PCC II)
**Hydraulic Fluid Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible fluid leaks from suspension components, reduced suspension performance, warning lights related to suspension system.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of leaking hydraulic lines, seals, or actuators. Refilling and bleeding the hydraulic system.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $2,500


## Electrical

### Infotainment System
**Screen Freezing/Unresponsiveness**
