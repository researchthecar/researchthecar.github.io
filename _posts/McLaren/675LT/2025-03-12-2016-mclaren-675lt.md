Here's a breakdown of the common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2016 McLaren 675LT. This vehicle boasts a 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 666 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. It's lauded for its incredible performance, track-focused handling, and distinctive styling. However, some owners have noted concerns regarding reliability, maintenance costs, and limited usability as a daily driver.

**Engine**

**3.8L Twin-Turbo V8**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks often occur from various seals and gaskets within the engine. Owners report seeing oil puddles under the car, smelling burning oil, and/or experiencing low oil level warnings. Common leak areas include valve cover gaskets, timing chain cover, and turbocharger oil lines.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty seals and gaskets. Thorough cleaning of the engine bay to remove residual oil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced turbocharger failures, leading to reduced power, unusual noises (whining or screeching), and potential engine damage. Failures can stem from oil starvation, faulty wastegates, or internal component wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty turbocharger(s). Investigating the root cause of the failure (e.g., oil supply issues) to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $15,000+ (depending on if one or both turbos need replacement and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**
*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dual-clutch transmissions, while offering rapid shifts, can be susceptible to premature clutch wear, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping during acceleration, jerky shifts, difficulty engaging gears, and transmission fault warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch pack. Performing a transmission adaptation reset.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hydraulic pump provides pressure for clutch actuation and gear selection. Failure can lead to shifting problems, transmission fault codes, and complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump and potentially associated sensors or solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Accumulator Failures (ProActive Chassis Control)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 675LT utilizes McLaren's ProActive Chassis Control, which uses hydraulic accumulators for adaptive damping. These accumulators can fail, resulting in a harsh ride, uneven handling, and suspension fault warnings.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty accumulator(s). Diagnosing and addressing any leaks in the hydraulic system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ (depending on how many accumulators need replacement and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the car (e.g., oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, wheel speed sensors) can fail, leading to performance issues, warning lights, and diagnostic trouble codes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific faulty sensor using diagnostic tools. Replacing the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ (depending on the sensor and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the car's battery draining quickly, especially when the car is not driven regularly. This can be due to parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic draw and addressing it (e.g., faulty module, improperly installed aftermarket accessories). Replacing the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity of the problem).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Hydraulic Lift System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The front-end lift system, which raises the front of the car to clear obstacles, can experience hydraulic leaks or pump failures. This results in the inability to raise the front, potentially damaging the front splitter.
    * Solution: Repairing or replacing the hydraulic pump, lines, or struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $7,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, and software bugs. Navigation may be inaccurate, and Bluetooth connectivity may be unreliable.
    *   Solution: Performing a software update. Replacing the infotainment system if the problems persist.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $5,000+ (for replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 McLaren 675LT offers exhilarating performance but comes with potential reliability concerns. Engine and transmission issues, particularly oil leaks, turbocharger problems, and clutch wear, can be costly to address. The suspension system's accumulators are another area prone to failure. While sensor failures and electrical gremlins are relatively less expensive, they can still be frustrating. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in maintenance and repair costs when considering this high-performance machine.
