The 2022 McLaren 765LT is a track-focused, limited-production supercar powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 755 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally rave about the car's incredible performance, razor-sharp handling, and visceral driving experience. However, some common complaints include a stiff ride, limited practicality, and the potential for high maintenance costs.

**Summary**

The 2022 McLaren 765LT, while an exceptional performance vehicle, is susceptible to certain issues. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger problems can be expensive to rectify. Transmission issues, especially clutch slippage, are also a concern. Suspension issues related to the accumulators can compromise the vehicle's handling. Electrical gremlins and carbon fiber issues are also potential problems. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, but prospective buyers should be aware of these potential expenses. Repair costs are generally high due to the specialized nature of the vehicle and the cost of parts.
