**Engine**

**3.0L Twin-Turbocharged V6**
*   **Engine Control Unit (ECU) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported intermittent engine misfires, hesitation during acceleration, or stalling due to software glitches or malfunctions in the engine control unit (ECU). These issues can sometimes be resolved with an ECU reflash or software update.
    *   Solution: A qualified McLaren technician will need to diagnose the ECU. Software updates, ECU reflash, or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Cooling System Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have noted coolant leaks originating from various points in the engine cooling system, including hoses, connections, or the water pump. Low coolant levels can lead to engine overheating and potential damage.
    *   Solution: Identifying and replacing the faulty cooling system component, such as a hose, connection, or water pump. Pressure testing the cooling system is recommended to ensure all leaks are resolved.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch**
*   **Transmission Control Module (TCM) Faults**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced erratic shifting behavior, delayed gear changes, or complete transmission failure due to software glitches or hardware malfunctions in the transmission control module (TCM).
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified McLaren technician is essential to determine the root cause. Software updates, TCM reflash, or replacement may be necessary.
