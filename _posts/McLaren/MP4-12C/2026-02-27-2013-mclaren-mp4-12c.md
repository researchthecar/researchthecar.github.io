### Summary Verdict
The 2013 McLaren MP4-12C is a highly capable supercar with a generally strong reliability record for its performance class. The twin-turbocharged V8 engine and dual-clutch transmission are robust, though specific components like turbochargers and clutch actuators can require attention over time. The advanced ProActive suspension system, while sophisticated, can be susceptible to hydraulic leaks. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and door modules, are the most commonly cited non-wear-and-tear issues. While major powertrain failures are rare, the cost of repairs for any component, especially complex electrical or hydraulic systems, can be significant due to the specialized nature of the vehicle. Regular, expert maintenance is paramount.
