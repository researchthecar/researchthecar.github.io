The 2012 McLaren MP4-12C marked McLaren's return to producing its own road cars after the iconic F1. It came standard with a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V8 engine producing around 592 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally praised the MP4-12C for its incredible performance, handling, and innovative technology. However, some common complaints included a somewhat sterile driving experience (compared to more visceral supercars), early model reliability issues, and a relatively uninspiring engine sound.
