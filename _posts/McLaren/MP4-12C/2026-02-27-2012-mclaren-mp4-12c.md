### Summary Verdict
The 2012 McLaren MP4-12C is a complex supercar with a performance-oriented design. While its core powertrain components are robust, owners have reported specific issues, particularly with the turbocharger wastegates, oil cooler leaks, and the sophisticated dual-clutch transmission's mechatronics and clutch actuators. Electrical gremlins, often related to the infotainment system or body control module, can also arise. The advanced ProActive suspension, while effective, can be a source of hydraulic leaks. Exterior issues are less common but can involve the unique dihedral door mechanisms. Overall, the MP4-12C requires diligent maintenance and specialized servicing, and potential buyers should be aware of these potential reliability concerns and factor in the associated repair costs.
