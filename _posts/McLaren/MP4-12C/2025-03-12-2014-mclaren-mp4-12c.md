**Engine**

**3.8L Twin-Turbocharged V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are commonly reported, often originating from the turbocharger oil lines and fittings, valve cover gaskets, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oil lines/fittings, valve cover gaskets, or rear main seal is necessary. Proper torque specifications must be adhered to during reassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the source and complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report premature turbocharger failure or issues such as wastegate actuator malfunctions. Symptoms include loss of power, unusual noises from the turbochargers, and potential engine warning lights.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the turbocharger, replacement of faulty turbocharger components (wastegate, actuator), or complete turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (per turbo, depending on the extent of damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are a common issue with various potential sources. Symptoms include visible coolant leaks, low coolant levels, and overheating.
    * Solution: Inspection and replacement of the leaking components (hoses, expansion tank, fittings).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the location and complexity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (SSG)**

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear is a somewhat common complaint, especially in cars driven aggressively. Symptoms include slipping during gear changes, difficulty engaging gears, and transmission fault warnings.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement, potentially including associated components like the clutch position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission's hydraulic pump can fail, leading to shifting problems. Symptoms include difficulty shifting, transmission fault warnings, and a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Proactive Chassis Control (PCC) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The PCC system, which manages the car's adaptive dampers, can experience problems. Symptoms include error messages, uneven ride height, and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the system, replacement of faulty dampers, sensors, or hydraulic components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Issues**
