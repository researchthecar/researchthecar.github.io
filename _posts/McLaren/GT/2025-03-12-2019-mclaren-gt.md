The 2019 McLaren GT is a grand tourer offering a blend of supercar performance and long-distance comfort. It features a single engine option: a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 producing 612 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. This engine is exclusively paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally praise the car's exhilarating performance, stunning design, and surprisingly comfortable ride for a supercar.
