The 2020 McLaren GT is a grand tourer offering a blend of supercar performance and long-distance comfort. It is powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 612 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. People often praise the GT for its stunning design, impressive acceleration, and relatively supple ride for a McLaren. Common complaints include the infotainment system's complexity, limited storage space, and potential for expensive repairs.
