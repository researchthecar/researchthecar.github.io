### Summary Verdict
The 2022 McLaren GT demonstrates strong technical reliability, particularly in its core powertrain and chassis systems. The 4.0L twin-turbo V8 engine and the 7-speed Seamless-Shift Gearbox have not shown widespread issues, reflecting McLaren's engineering prowess. The advanced Proactive Chassis Control III suspension also appears robust. Minor electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system's software, are the most commonly cited, though typically resolvable with updates. Beyond these minor points, the exterior and interior components are generally well-built. As with any supercar, maintenance costs will be higher than average, but the inherent reliability of the major systems is a positive indicator for owners.
