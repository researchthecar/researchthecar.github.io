The 2021 McLaren GT is a grand tourer that combines supercar performance with enhanced comfort and practicality, compared to McLaren's more track-focused models. It features a mid-mounted 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 612 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally praise the GT for its stunning design, exhilarating acceleration, and surprisingly comfortable ride for a car of its performance capabilities. However, some common criticisms include the limited practicality of the low-slung design, infotainment system quirks, and concerns about long-term reliability, as well as expensive repair costs.
