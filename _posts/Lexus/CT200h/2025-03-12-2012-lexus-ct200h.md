The 2012 Lexus CT200h is a hybrid hatchback that combines fuel efficiency with Lexus luxury and reliability. It features a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 134 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. The CT200h is only available with an electronically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). Owners appreciate its fuel economy (around 43 MPG combined), comfortable ride, and upscale interior.
