Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2022 Lexus ES 300h, categorized by major component, and formatted as requested.

The 2022 Lexus ES 300h is a popular luxury hybrid sedan known for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency, and Lexus's reputation for reliability. The ES 300h is powered by a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 215 horsepower and an estimated 163 lb-ft of torque (from the electric motor). The ES also offers a 2.5-liter inline-4 with 203 horsepower (ES 250) and a 3.5-liter V6 with 302 horsepower (ES 350) not paired with an electric motor. The ES 300h uses an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). Many owners appreciate the ES 300h for its quiet cabin, smooth ride, and excellent fuel economy. Some common complaints include the somewhat uninspiring handling and acceleration (relative to some competitors), and the infotainment system, which some find less intuitive than those of other luxury brands.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Hybrid (2AR-FXE) with Electric Motor**

*   **Excessive Engine Vibration at Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing noticeable engine vibration, particularly when the car is stopped at a light or idling. This vibration can be felt through the steering wheel, seats, and floorboards. The vibration tends to go away when the vehicle is in motion, with the electric motor doing most of the work.
    *   Solution: This has been addressed by Lexus. Check to ensure your vehicle has the latest software update for the hybrid control system. Some owners have reported success with software updates or adjustments to the engine mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dependent on warranty status. Software updates are typically free, engine mount replacement is $300 - $600+ depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, which controls navigation, audio, and climate functions, can sometimes freeze, become unresponsive, or unexpectedly reboot. This can happen intermittently and disrupt the driving experience.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates for the infotainment system. Perform a system reset (consult owner's manual). If the problem persists, the dealer may need to diagnose and potentially replace a faulty head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are usually free. Head unit replacement can be $800 - $2000+ depending on labor and parts costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery can drain prematurely, leading to issues with starting the car or operating electrical components. This is often related to short trips, as the hybrid system does not always adequately charge the 12V battery in those situations.
    *   Solution: Ensure the vehicle is driven for longer periods occasionally to allow the 12V battery to fully charge. Some owners have opted to use a trickle charger to maintain the battery's charge level. In some cases, battery replacement is necessary. Also, check for aftermarket electronic devices that are causing drain while parked
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Trickle charger is $20-$50+. Battery replacement is $150 - $300+ including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard/Trim Rattling or Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported experiencing rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard or interior trim, particularly on rough roads or during colder temperatures.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the noise and applying felt tape or foam padding to dampen vibrations. The dealer may be able to address this issue under warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: DIY solutions can be inexpensive (under $20). Dealer repairs vary greatly depending on the severity and location of the rattle; expect $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The parking sensors or blind spot monitoring system may occasionally give false alerts or fail to detect objects. This can be intermittent and affected by weather conditions.
    *   Solution: Ensure sensors are clean and free of debris (snow, ice, dirt). The dealer may need to recalibrate the sensors or replace faulty units.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Sensor cleaning is free. Recalibration can cost $100 - $300. Sensor replacement can range from $300 - $800+ depending on the sensor location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2022 Lexus ES 300h generally exhibits solid reliability, consistent with Lexus's reputation. The most frequently reported issues involve the infotainment system, engine vibration, and occasional sensor glitches. While the issues can be frustrating, they don't typically represent major mechanical failures. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the issue and whether it's covered under warranty. Overall, the ES 300h appears to be a relatively trouble-free vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these common concerns and check for software updates and sensor functionality during inspection.
