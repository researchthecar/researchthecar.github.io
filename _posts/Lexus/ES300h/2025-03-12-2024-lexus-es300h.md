The 2024 Lexus ES 300h is a luxury hybrid sedan known for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency, and elegant interior. It is powered by a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine paired with an electric motor, delivering a combined 215 horsepower and ample torque for everyday driving. Other engine options for the ES series include the ES 250's 2.5-liter inline-4 (non-hybrid) and the ES 350's 3.5-liter V6. All ES 300h models use an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). Owners often praise the ES 300h for its smooth hybrid powertrain, quiet cabin, and comprehensive suite of safety features. Some common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired driving dynamics compared to sportier rivals and the infotainment system's learning curve.
