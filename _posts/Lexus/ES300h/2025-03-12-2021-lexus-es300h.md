The 2021 Lexus ES 300h is a luxury hybrid sedan known for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency, and elegant interior. It boasts a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 215 horsepower. The ES 300h comes exclusively with an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). While owners generally praise the car's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and excellent fuel economy, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's cumbersome touchpad interface and a somewhat uninspiring driving experience despite its luxurious aspirations. Other ES models are available with a 3.5-liter V6 engine, which produces 302 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque.
