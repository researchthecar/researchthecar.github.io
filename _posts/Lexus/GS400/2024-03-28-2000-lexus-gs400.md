**Introduction:**

The 2000 Lexus GS400 is a midsize luxury sedan known for its opulent interior, reliable performance, and smooth ride. Under the hood lies a potent 4.0L V8 engine paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, delivering 300 horsepower and 312 lb-ft of torque. While the GS400 boasts various admirable qualities, it is not without its share of reported issues.

**Engine**

**4.0L V8**

- **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Leaks coolant and oil, causing engine misfires and overheating. Requires replacing the intake manifold gasket. **$1000 - $1500**
- **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator Failure:** Problems with the VVT actuator can lead to reduced engine power, rough idling, and increased fuel consumption. Replacement of the VVT actuator is necessary. **$500 - $1000**
- **Fuel Injector Issues:** Faulty fuel injectors can cause difficulty starting, engine misfires, and reduced fuel efficiency. Replacement of the affected fuel injectors is required. **$300 - $600**

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

- **Torque Converter Failure:** Symptoms include shuddering during gear shifts, slipping gears, and loss of power. Torque converter replacement is needed. **$1500 - $2500**
- **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** Worn or faulty seals can cause transmission fluid leaks, leading to slippage and potential transmission failure. Replacing the leaking seals is necessary. **$200 - $500**

**Suspension**

- **Strut Top Mount Bearing Failure:** Worn or damaged strut top mount bearings can cause a knocking or clunking noise during suspension movement. Replacing the affected strut top mount bearings is required. **$300 - $600**
- **Front Lower Control Arm Bushings:** Deteriorated control arm bushings can result in a rough ride, reduced stability, and uneven tire wear. Replacement of the affected bushings is necessary. **$200 - $400**

**Electrical**

- **Alternator Failure:** Signs include flickering lights, dim headlights, and difficulty starting. Replacement of the alternator is required. **$500 - $1000**
- **Starter Motor Failure:** A faulty starter motor can make it difficult or impossible to start the engine. Replacing the starter motor is necessary. **$300 - $600**

**Exterior**

- **Tail Light Condensation:** Moisture can accumulate inside the tail lights, causing poor visibility and potential electrical issues. Repairing the tail light assembly may be necessary. **$200 - $400**
- **Headlight Lens Fading:** Over time, headlight lenses can become oxidized and faded, reducing their effectiveness. Lens restoration or replacement may be needed. **$100 - $300**

**Interior**

- **Clock Malfunction:** The clock may display incorrect time or stop working due to a software glitch or faulty wiring. Reprogramming or repairing the clock is necessary. **$100 - $200**
- **Navigation System Malfunction:** The navigation system may freeze, display incorrect data, or become unresponsive. Software updates or hardware repairs may be needed. **$300 - $1000**

**Summary:**

While the 2000 Lexus GS400 is a generally reliable vehicle, it is not immune to certain issues. The most common problems involve engine and transmission components, such as intake manifold gasket failure, VVT actuator problems, and torque converter issues. Electrical problems with the alternator and starter motor are also reported. Exterior issues include tail light condensation and headlight lens fading. Interior issues primarily relate to the clock and navigation system. The severity of these issues varies, and repair costs can range from minor to moderate. Overall, the GS400 is a solid choice for a luxury sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of these reported issues before making a purchase.
