The 2000 Lexus GS400 is a popular luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and reliable performance. It came equipped with a powerful 4.0L V8 engine producing 300 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. While the GS400 is generally well-regarded, some owners have reported specific issues. Many people appreciate the vehicle's comfortable ride, strong acceleration, and luxurious features. Some common complaints revolve around its age, which can lead to increased maintenance needs, especially concerning rubber and plastic components. Gas mileage is also a common downside for consumers.

**Engine**

**4.0L 1UZ-FE V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets, most commonly the valve cover gaskets, crankshaft seal, and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, oil consumption, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking seals and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the location of the leak and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VVTi System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Valve Timing intelligent (VVTi) system can develop issues over time. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased performance, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific VVTi component causing the issue (actuator, solenoid, etc.) and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the component and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A650E 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit delayed or harsh shifting between gears, particularly when cold. This can be caused by worn valve body components, low transmission fluid, or a failing solenoid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnosis and repair of the valve body or solenoids may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush and filter), $500 - $1500+ (valve body or solenoid repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slippage can occur, especially during acceleration. This indicates worn clutch packs within the transmission.
    *   Solution: A transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the struts and shock absorbers can wear out, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**

    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the component and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Illumination Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster lights can dim or flicker, making it difficult to read the gauges. This is often due to aging capacitors or other components within the cluster.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Lexus GS400 is a reliable vehicle overall, but its age means that certain issues are more prevalent. Engine oil leaks, transmission problems (especially harsh shifting or slippage), suspension wear, and electrical problems (instrument cluster and power windows) are the most commonly reported problems. The cost of repairs can range from relatively minor to quite significant, particularly if a transmission rebuild or navigation screen replacement is needed. Before purchasing, a thorough inspection by a qualified mechanic is recommended to identify any potential issues.
