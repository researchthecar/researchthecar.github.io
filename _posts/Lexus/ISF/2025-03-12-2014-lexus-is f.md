The 2014 Lexus IS F is a high-performance variant of the IS sedan, equipped with a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine. This engine is the only option available for the IS F model. The 5.0L V8 produces 416 horsepower and 371 lb-ft of torque, coupled exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically praise the IS F for its powerful engine, engaging driving dynamics, and comfortable interior, while common criticisms include its relatively dated technology compared to newer models, fuel economy, and potentially high maintenance costs associated with a performance vehicle.

**Engine**

**5.0L 2UR-GSE V8**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 2UR-GSE can experience carbon buildup on the intake valves over time. This can lead to rough idling, decreased performance, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Performing a walnut blasting or chemical cleaning of the intake valves to remove the carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

**Suspension**
*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear shock absorbers, especially on vehicles with higher mileage, may develop leaks. This can lead to a bouncy ride, reduced handling performance, and noise from the rear suspension.
