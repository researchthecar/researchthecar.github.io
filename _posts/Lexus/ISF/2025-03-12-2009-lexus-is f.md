The 2009 Lexus IS F is a high-performance sedan that debuted with a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 416 horsepower and 371 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission. There were no other engine or transmission options available. Owners often praise the IS F for its engaging driving dynamics, potent engine, and comfortable interior. Some common complaints include its firm ride, limited rear seat space, and relatively high fuel consumption compared to other IS models.

**Engine**

**5.0L 2UR-GSE V8**

*   **Oil Cooler Line Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original oil cooler lines are prone to leaking, potentially leading to oil starvation and engine damage. The leak is often first noticed as drips of oil on the ground or visible oil residue around the oil cooler lines and fittings.
    *   Solution: Replace the original oil cooler lines with updated, revised lines that are more resistant to leaks. Some owners opt for aftermarket solutions with braided lines and improved fittings for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2UR-GSE engines, particularly in earlier model years, have experienced valve spring failures. This can result in misfires, rough running, loss of power, and potentially more serious engine damage if not addressed promptly. Ticking or clicking noises from the engine may be a precursor to this failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing all the valve springs with updated, stronger springs. It is recommended to replace all springs even if only one has failed to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+ (depending on the shop and extent of damage, if any)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Air Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The secondary air injection system air pump can fail causing a check engine light. Common codes are P2440, P2441, P2442, P2443, P2444, P2445, P2446, P2447, P2448, P2449, P1603, P1604, P1605, P1606, P1607, P1608, P1609.
    * Solution: Replacement of the air pump, or full secondary air injection system delete.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A760E 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter shudder, hesitation during acceleration, and abnormal noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement, potentially with a higher-stall unit for performance enhancement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear shocks can wear out prematurely, leading to a bouncy ride, reduced handling precision, and increased body roll.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers. Some owners opt for aftermarket shocks with adjustable damping for improved performance and ride comfort.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the brand and type of shock)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System/Radio Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory navigation system or radio unit can experience malfunctions, including screen freezing, loss of sound, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the navigation/radio unit. Aftermarket head units are also a common upgrade.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on repair vs. replacement and aftermarket options)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **HID Headlight Ballast Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: HID headlights can flicker or fail to illuminate due to a faulty ballast.
