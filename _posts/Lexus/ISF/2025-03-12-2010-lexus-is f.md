The 2010 Lexus IS F is a high-performance sedan boasting a naturally aspirated 5.0L V8 engine paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. This engine produces 416 horsepower and 371 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally praise the IS F for its potent engine, engaging driving dynamics, comfortable interior, and Lexus reliability. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, a somewhat dated infotainment system, and the firm ride due to the sport-tuned suspension.

**Summary:**

The 2010 Lexus IS F generally enjoys a reputation for reliability. However, potential buyers should be aware of the oil cooler line leak, potential valve spring issues, and the potential for harsh shifting from the transmission. Suspension bushings are also prone to wear. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for simpler fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. While some issues like the navigation screen can be costly, the severity of most other issues is relatively low as long as they are addressed promptly.
