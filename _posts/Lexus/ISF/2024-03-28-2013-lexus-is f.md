**Summary:**

The 2013 Lexus IS F is a well-regarded performance sedan with a powerful engine and enjoyable driving experience. However, it is not without its potential issues. The most serious concerns are related to the engine (oil consumption, timing chain tensioner failure) and transmission (slippage, shift solenoid failure), which can lead to significant repairs and expenses. Other issues, such as suspension components, electrical malfunctions, and interior creaks and rattles, while less severe, can still be annoying and detract from the overall ownership experience.
