The 2011 Lexus IS F is a high-performance sedan that distinguishes itself from the standard IS models with its powerful 5.0L V8 engine. Unlike other IS models, the IS F only came with one engine and transmission option: a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 producing 416 horsepower and 371 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the IS F for its engaging driving experience, strong performance, and Lexus reliability. Criticisms often include the firm ride, somewhat dated infotainment system, and relatively poor fuel economy compared to modern performance sedans.

**Engine**

**5.0L 2UR-GSE V8**

*   **Oil Leaks from the Valve Cover Gaskets**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from the valve cover gaskets, leading to a burning smell, visible oil drips, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Secondary Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Secondary Air Injection System helps to reduce emissions during cold starts. The pump may fail, triggering a check engine light and a code related to the secondary air injection system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty secondary air injection pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak from Water Pump**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant can leak from the water pump, indicated by a visible leak, low coolant level, and potential overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$900
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A760E 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit rough or delayed shifting, especially when cold. This can manifest as noticeable jerks or hesitation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and potentially reprogramming the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $2000+ (valve body)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: The front lower control arm bushings on the Lexus IS F are known to wear out prematurely, particularly on vehicles subjected to aggressive driving or poor road conditions. Symptoms include clunking noises during suspension movement, reduced steering precision, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the lower control arm bushings. It may be more cost-effective to replace the entire lower control arm assembly as it includes new bushings and ball joint.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation Screen Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen can experience delamination, where the layers of the screen separate, leading to a cloudy or distorted display.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the navigation screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Lexus IS F, while a generally reliable performance sedan, does have some known issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine-related issues such as oil leaks and secondary air injection pump failures can be moderately expensive to address. Transmission issues like rough shifting may require relatively simple fixes like a fluid flush, or more costly solutions such as valve body repair. Owners should also be mindful of suspension wear, particularly the front lower control arm bushings, and potential electrical issues like navigation screen delamination. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on the specific problem.
