The 2013 Lexus IS F is a high-performance sedan boasting a naturally aspirated 5.0L V8 engine, delivering 416 horsepower and 371 lb-ft of torque. Unlike the standard IS models, the IS F had only one engine and transmission option available in 2013: the 5.0L V8 paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the IS F for its potent engine, sharp handling, and relative exclusivity. Common complaints often revolve around the firm ride quality, outdated infotainment system, and high fuel consumption compared to more modern performance sedans.

**Engine**

**5.0L 2UR-GSE V8**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 2UR-GSE can be prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, as there is no fuel washing over them to clean them. This can lead to rough idling, decreased performance, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: A manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) is often required. Chemical induction services can sometimes help, but are often not as effective for severe buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets and Timing Cover)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from the valve cover gaskets or the timing cover. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets or resealing the timing cover is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gaskets: $300 - $600; Timing cover reseal: $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump can fail, leading to overheating. Signs include coolant leaks, high engine temperature, and a whirring noise from the pump.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A760E 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing delayed or harsh shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. This could be due to worn solenoids or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and potentially replacing solenoids or rebuilding the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush $200 - $400; Solenoid replacement or valve body rebuild: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear in the lower control arm bushings can cause clunking noises, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lower control arms or just the bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushing Replacement $200 - $500; Lower control arm replacement: $400 - $1000+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Leaking rear shock absorbers will cause poor handling, and a bouncy ride. They will also appear to be wet with oil.
    * Solution: Replacement of rear shock absorbers
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system can experience glitches, slow response times, or complete failure.

**Summary**

The 2013 Lexus IS F, while a highly desirable performance sedan, has its share of potential issues. Engine-related problems, particularly carbon buildup and oil leaks, are common concerns. Suspension components such as control arm bushings can wear prematurely. Electrical issues, primarily affecting the navigation system and audio amplifier, can also surface. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or electrical repairs. While not all IS F models will experience these issues, it's important to be aware of them when considering purchasing one.
