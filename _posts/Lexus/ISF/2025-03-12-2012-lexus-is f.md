The 2012 Lexus IS F is a high-performance sedan featuring a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 416 horsepower and 371 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an Aisin AA80E 8-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the standard IS models, the IS F did not have other engine options such as a V6 or a 2.5 liter. Owners often praise its potent engine, responsive handling, and comfortable interior, but some common complaints include its firm ride, limited rear passenger space, and relatively poor fuel economy compared to its competitors.
