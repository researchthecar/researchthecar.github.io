The 2009 Lexus RX350 is a popular luxury crossover known for its comfortable ride, reliability, and upscale features. It came with a single engine option, a 3.5-liter V6 (2GR-FE) producing 270 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission (U151E). Owners often praise its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and luxurious interior. Some common complaints include the dated infotainment system, less engaging handling compared to some competitors, and potentially high maintenance costs associated with luxury vehicles.
