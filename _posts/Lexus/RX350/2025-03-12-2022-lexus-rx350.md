The 2022 Lexus RX350 is a popular luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, reliability, and upscale interior. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 295 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Another available option is the RX 450h, which has a hybrid setup. Owners often praise the RX350 for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and Lexus' reputation for dependability. However, some common criticisms include its somewhat uninspired driving dynamics, a polarizing infotainment system interface, and less cargo space than some competitors. The following list details common issues and complaints owners have reported with the 2022 RX350.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (2GR-FKS)**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine misfires, often accompanied by a check engine light. These misfires can cause rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors, and vacuum lines. Replacing faulty components, especially ignition coils, is a common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on the cause and number of components replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported oil leaks, often around the valve cover gaskets or timing cover. These leaks can lead to oil consumption and, if left unaddressed, potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the standard fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the location and complexity of the repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. Others have experienced hesitation or delays in gear engagement.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of torque converter shudder or vibration, especially at low speeds or during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Flushing the transmission fluid may help, but a failing torque converter often requires replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, particularly the Lexus Enform system, can freeze, become unresponsive, or unexpectedly reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Applying software updates, resetting the system, or replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Blind Spot Monitor, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Blind Spot Monitor (BSM) system or parking sensors may malfunction, providing false warnings or failing to detect obstacles.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scanning to identify the faulty sensor, followed by sensor replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on location and labor.
