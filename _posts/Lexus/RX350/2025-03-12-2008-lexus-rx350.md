The 2008 Lexus RX 350 is a popular luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, reliability, and smooth powertrain. It came with only one engine option, a 3.5L V6 (2GR-FE) producing 270 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission (U151E/F). Owners often praise the RX 350 for its quiet cabin, upscale interior, and overall build quality. Common criticisms include a somewhat bland driving experience and less-than-stellar fuel economy compared to newer models. While the RX 350 is generally reliable, certain issues do arise as these vehicles age.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (2GR-FE)**

* **Oil Leaks from the Valve Cover Gaskets**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue as the gaskets age and dry out. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

* **VVTi Oil Line Failure (Early Production)**
    * Description/Symptoms: This issue mainly affects early production 2GR-FE engines in the 2007-2008 model years. The original rubber oil cooler hose for the Variable Valve Timing intelligent (VVTi) system could rupture, leading to rapid oil loss and potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the original rubber oil cooler hose with an updated, all-metal line.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (depending on location and if any engine damage occurred)
    * Recalls: None Found (Technical Service Bulletin issued, not a recall)

* **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The water pump can fail over time, leading to coolant leaks and overheating. Symptoms include coolant leaks near the water pump, a whining noise from the engine, and rising temperature gauge.
    * Solution: Replace the water pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (U151E/F)**

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a shudder or vibration during light acceleration, especially between 30-45 mph. This can be due to degradation of the transmission fluid or issues with the torque converter itself.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush using Toyota WS fluid. If the shudder persists, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush: $150 - $300; Torque Converter Replacement: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: As the transmission ages, some owners experience delayed or harsh shifting, particularly when shifting between gears. This can be caused by worn valve body components or internal wear.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and check the fluid level. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced, or the transmission may require a full rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush: $150 - $300; Valve Body Rebuild/Replacement: $500 - $1200; Transmission Rebuild/Replacement: $2500 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut and Shock Absorber Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time, the struts and shock absorbers wear out, leading to a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and increased stopping distances.
    * Solution: Replace the worn struts and shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+ (for all four corners)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Suspension Clunking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience a clunking noise from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can be caused by worn sway bar bushings, end links, or control arm bushings.
    * Solution: Inspect and replace worn sway bar bushings, end links, or control arm bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on which parts need replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: One or more of the power door locks may stop working, either failing to lock or unlock.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per door
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Navigation/Radio Screen Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation/radio screen can sometimes fail or exhibit intermittent issues, such as dimming, flickering, or complete loss of display.
    * Solution: In some cases, the screen can be repaired. However, in many cases, the entire head unit needs to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Repair: $200 - $500; Replacement: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture can build up inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation and reduced visibility.
    * Solution: Remove the headlight assembly and dry out the housing. Resealing the housing may help prevent future condensation. Replacement is also an option.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Resealing: $50 - $200; Replacement: $300 - $800+ per headlight
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracking on the dashboard, especially in hotter climates.
    * Solution: There is no easy fix for dashboard cracking. The dashboard can be replaced, or a dashboard cover can be used.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Dashboard Cover: $50 - $200; Dashboard Replacement: $1000 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Lexus RX 350 is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it can experience issues as it ages. The most common problems revolve around engine oil leaks, transmission performance, and suspension wear. While some issues, like valve cover gasket replacement, are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or dashboard replacement, can be quite costly. Overall, the RX 350 is a good choice for a used SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have a pre-purchase inspection performed to identify any existing problems.
