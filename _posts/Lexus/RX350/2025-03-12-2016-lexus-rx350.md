The 2016 Lexus RX350 is a popular luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, upscale interior, and reliability. It's generally considered a well-built vehicle, but like any car, it has its share of potential problems. The RX350 came with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (295 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque) mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. The RX450h was also available, featuring a hybrid powertrain. Owners often praise the RX350 for its smooth driving experience and luxurious features, while some criticize its somewhat detached steering feel and infotainment system. This guide will focus on the RX350 with the standard V6 engine and 8-speed transmission.
