Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Lexus GS F, formatted for your website and designed for accuracy.

The 2019 Lexus GS F is a high-performance luxury sedan, equipped with a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 467 horsepower and 389 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The GS F is lauded for its engaging driving dynamics, comfortable interior, and Lexus reliability, but it does have a few potential problem areas. Some owners dislike the somewhat dated infotainment system and the car's fuel economy, which is typical of a high-performance V8.

**Engine**

**5.0L 2UR-GSE V8**
* **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves (Potential)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 2UR-GSE can experience carbon buildup on the intake valves due to the lack of fuel washing over them. Symptoms include rough idle, decreased performance, and potential misfires. This is less frequent on the GS F compared to turbocharged engines, but still possible.
    * Solution: Walnut blasting or chemical cleaning of the intake valves.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks (Potential)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported minor oil leaks developing around the valve covers or other engine seals as the car ages. These are usually slow leaks.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets and seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location and complexity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (AA80E)**
* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation (Rare)**
    * Description/Symptoms: A small number of owners have reported occasional harsh shifting or hesitation, particularly when cold or during specific driving conditions. This can sometimes be related to transmission fluid degradation or valve body issues.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush/replacement, or valve body repair/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on the issue
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Malfunction (Rare)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The GS F features AVS, which can, on occasion, experience a malfunction. This may manifest as a warning light on the dashboard, a noticeably stiffer or softer ride than expected, or uneven handling.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to determine the faulty component (e.g., strut, sensor, or module) and replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the component
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting (Rare)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Lexus infotainment system, while functional, is often criticized for its usability and dated graphics. Some owners have experienced occasional freezing or spontaneous rebooting.
    * Solution: Software update if available. Replacement of the head unit may be required in some cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+ depending on the solution.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Issues (Rare)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the car (e.g., O2 sensors, wheel speed sensors) can fail, triggering warning lights and potentially affecting performance.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* No Issues Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking (Potential in Hot Climates)**
    * Description/Symptoms: In very hot and sunny climates, some owners have reported cracking of the dashboard material over time. This is more of a cosmetic issue than a functional one.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Lexus GS F is a generally reliable vehicle. The most frequently cited potential issues revolve around carbon buildup in the engine, which can affect performance, and minor oil leaks as the car ages. Infotainment glitches and sensor failures are less common. While the cost of repairs can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, most issues are not considered major or catastrophic, and are rare. Prospective buyers should have the car thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase, paying particular attention to the engine for signs of carbon buildup and any fluid leaks.
