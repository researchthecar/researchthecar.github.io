The 2018 Lexus GS F is a high-performance luxury sedan featuring a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 467 horsepower and 389 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the standard GS, the GS F has no other engine or transmission options. Owners often praise the GS F for its engaging driving experience, powerful engine, comfortable interior, and Lexus reliability. Criticisms typically revolve around its dated infotainment system, somewhat stiff ride, and fuel economy compared to turbocharged rivals.

**Engine**

**5.0L 2UR-GSE V8**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 2UR-GSE can experience carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over the back of the valves. This buildup can lead to rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the intake valves via walnut blasting or chemical cleaning. Installing an oil catch can might help mitigate future buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, fuel smell, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on how many injectors need to be replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**AWR80 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifting, particularly when cold. Can also manifest as hesitation or clunking noises during gear changes.
    * Solution: Software update of the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes alleviate the issue. In some cases, replacement of the transmission valve body or complete transmission replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (for software update) - $5,000+ (for valve body or transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning light on the dashboard. Stiff or uncomfortable ride. Clicking or grinding noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty AVS actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000 per actuator (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Black screen, unresponsive touch, flickering display, or ghosting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the screen or the entire infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car is slow to turn over when starting. Battery is dead in the morning.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the electrical system to find the source of the parasitic draw. Replacing the battery may be necessary but may not solve the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Cracking Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or repair. Applying a dash cover can also help mitigate further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Lexus GS F is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it has potential issues. The most significant concerns relate to carbon buildup in the engine, harsh shifting of the transmission, adaptive suspension actuator failures, electrical issues with the infotainment system, and interior cracking on the dashboard. The cost of repair can vary widely depending on the severity and complexity of the problem. The carbon buildup and electrical issues appear to be the most prevelant. These issues are generally not severe, but can be costly to fix.
