The 2016 Lexus GS F is a high-performance sedan featuring a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 467 horsepower and 389 lb-ft of torque. It is exclusively paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the GS F for its comfortable ride, powerful engine, sharp handling, and distinctive styling. Criticisms often include its infotainment system, which can be cumbersome to use, and fuel economy that is expectedly low given its performance capabilities. This report summarizes common issues reported by owners, categorized by major components.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8 (2UR-GSE)**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct-injection engines like the 2UR-GSE can be prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing the valves. Symptoms include rough idling, reduced power, decreased fuel economy, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: A walnut blasting service to clean the intake valves is the most common remedy. Chemical induction cleaning can also help but is generally less effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks around the perimeter of the valve covers or onto the exhaust manifolds, causing a burning smell. The valve covers are located on top of the cylinder heads on both sides of the engine, and the gaskets deteriorate over time with heat cycling.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (AA80E)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, especially during downshifts. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with the correct Lexus spec fluid can sometimes improve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body issues might require replacement or repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush, $800 - $2000+ for valve body work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The GS F features AVS which can fail over time, leading to a rough or inconsistent ride. Error messages on the dashboard related to the suspension system may also appear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty AVS actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per actuator depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot.
    *   Solution: Software updates, if available, can sometimes resolve the issue. In some cases, the head unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates may be free, head unit replacement can cost $1000 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery. Diagnosing and addressing any parasitic draws if a new battery also drains quickly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for battery replacement, diagnostic costs vary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **LED Headlight Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure or flickering of LED headlights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+ per headlight assembly
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation Screen Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The coating on the navigation screen may start to peel or bubble, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the navigation screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Lexus GS F is generally considered a reliable performance sedan. The most common issues reported include carbon buildup, valve cover oil leaks, harsh shifting, potential for AVS failure, infotainment glitches, and occasional battery drain. The carbon buildup issue is typical for direct injection engines and can be addressed proactively. The AVS actuators may also fail with the car's age. While repairs can be costly, the overall frequency and severity of these issues seem relatively low compared to some other performance vehicles, reflecting Lexus' reputation for reliability.
