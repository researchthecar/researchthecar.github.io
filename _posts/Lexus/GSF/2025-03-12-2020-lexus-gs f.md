**Engine**

**5.0L V8 (2UR-GSE)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct-injection engines, like the 2UR-GSE, can be prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over the back of the valve like on port-injected engines. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Walnut blasting or chemical cleaning of the intake valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The AVS system can experience malfunctions, resulting in a warning light on the dash, a harsher or bouncier ride quality, or uneven handling. This is often related to failing actuators or sensors within the system.
    * Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the faulty component (actuator, sensor, or wiring). Replacement of the failed part is usually required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+ depending on the component and labor.
