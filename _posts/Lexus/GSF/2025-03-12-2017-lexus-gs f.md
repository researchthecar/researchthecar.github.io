The 2017 Lexus GS F is a high-performance luxury sedan powered by a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine, producing 467 horsepower and 389 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GS F for its engaging driving experience, comfortable interior, and Lexus reliability. However, some common criticisms include its relatively dated infotainment system and its fuel economy compared to turbocharged competitors.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8 (2UR-GSE)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 2UR-GSE can suffer from carbon buildup on the intake valves, as there is no fuel washing over them to keep them clean. This can lead to rough idling, decreased performance, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Walnut blasting or chemical cleaning of the intake valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (AA80E)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The GS F features an AVS system that allows for adjustable ride stiffness. Individual struts may fail, causing the system to default to a stiffer setting or trigger a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty AVS strut(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $150 for software updates, $1000+ for replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the car battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. Common culprits include faulty relays or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2017 Lexus GS F is generally a reliable vehicle, but some common issues exist. Carbon buildup on the engine, AVS suspension failures, infotainment system glitches, and potential battery drain issues are some of the more prevalent problems. While the carbon buildup may require periodic maintenance, the AVS strut replacements can be expensive. The infotainment issues are usually minor. While not without potential issues, the GS F remains a well-regarded performance sedan, and the issues are not severe enough to detract from the ownership experience for most people.
