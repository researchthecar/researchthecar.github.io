**Summary:**

The 2005 Lexus LX470 is a generally reliable vehicle but has some common issues due to its age. The most frequently reported problems revolve around the engine (oil leaks, coolant leaks), suspension (AHC system malfunctions), and electrical systems (navigation screen, door lock actuators). Many of the issues have moderate severity and the cost to fix can range from relatively inexpensive repairs to more significant expenses, especially related to the AHC system. Addressing these proactively or upon first symptom appearance will help maintain the vehicle's overall reliability and longevity.
