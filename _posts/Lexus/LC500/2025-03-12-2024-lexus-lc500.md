The 2024 Lexus LC500 is a luxury grand tourer, celebrated for its striking design, refined interior, and engaging driving experience. Available as a coupe or convertible, it primarily appeals to drivers seeking a blend of style, comfort, and performance. While it's praised for its smooth ride, luxurious appointments, and reliable Lexus build quality, some common dislikes include its limited rear seat space (in the coupe), smaller trunk space, and infotainment system interface. The LC500 is powered by a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 471 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. There is also a hybrid option with a 3.5L V6. Because this information is not as commonly available, I will only be including information about the standard gasoline version.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8**

*   **Fuel Injector Issue**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and decreased fuel economy. Potentially caused by carbon buildup on the fuel injectors, leading to improper fuel atomization.
    *   Solution: Professional cleaning of the fuel injectors or replacement of the affected injectors is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported occasional harsh shifting or hesitation between gears, particularly at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) reflash or software update can resolve the issue. More severe cases might require valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (reflash) - $3,000+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Lexus infotainment system, while improved, can still exhibit occasional freezing, lagging, or unresponsiveness.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealership are typically the first step. In rare cases, the infotainment unit itself might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (unit replacement)

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported minor rattles or squeaks emanating from interior trim pieces, especially in the dashboard or door panels. This is more prevalent in convertible models.
    *   Solution: Identifying and tightening the loose trim pieces or applying felt tape to contact points to eliminate the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Lexus LC500 appears to be a generally reliable vehicle, consistent with Lexus' reputation. The most commonly reported issues revolve around the infotainment system, the transmission, and minor interior noise. Engine issues are relatively rare. While some repairs, such as infotainment unit replacement or major transmission work, can be costly, many issues can be resolved with software updates or minor adjustments. The severity of reported problems is generally low to moderate.
