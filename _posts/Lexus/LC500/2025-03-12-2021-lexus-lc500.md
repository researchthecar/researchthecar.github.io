The 2021 Lexus LC 500 is a grand touring coupe known for its stunning design, luxurious interior, and engaging driving experience. It is available with a naturally aspirated 5.0L V8 engine producing 471 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque or a 3.5L V6 with a hybrid motor to produce a combined 354 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The V8 is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid utilizes a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the LC 500 for its comfortable ride, high-quality materials, and distinctive styling. However, some criticisms include the limited rear seat space, infotainment system interface, and relatively small trunk.
