The 2020 Lexus LC 500 is a luxury grand tourer known for its striking design, comfortable ride, and engaging driving experience. It is powered by a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 471 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid variant, the LC 500h, features a 3.5-liter V6 engine combined with an electric motor, producing a total system output of 354 horsepower, using a unique multi-stage hybrid transmission. Owners often praise the LC 500 for its stunning aesthetics, luxurious interior, and the powerful sound of the V8 engine. Common criticisms include the limited rear seat space, the sometimes cumbersome infotainment system, and the relatively high price point.

**Summary**

The 2020 Lexus LC 500 is a generally reliable luxury vehicle, but some owners have reported issues, mainly concerning the fuel injectors, and oil leaks on the V8 engine, as well as shift quality on the 10-speed transmission. Infotainment glitches and AVS malfunctions can also occur, contributing to repair costs. While some fixes like software updates are relatively inexpensive, more significant issues, such as fuel injector replacements or transmission repairs, can lead to considerable expenses. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
