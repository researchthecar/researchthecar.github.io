The 2023 Lexus NX250 is an entry-level luxury crossover known for its comfortable ride, stylish interior, and reputation for reliability. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of reported issues. The NX250 is powered by a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 engine producing 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2023 NX include the NX350 with a 2.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine, the NX350h hybrid with a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine paired with electric motors, and the NX450h+ plug-in hybrid with a similar setup to the NX350h but with a larger battery. One common complaint about the NX250 is its relatively slow acceleration compared to other models in the NX lineup. The NX250 and NX350 are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid models use a CVT. Owners often praise the NX250 for its luxurious interior, smooth ride, and fuel efficiency, while some criticize its infotainment system, small cargo area, and lack of engaging driving dynamics.
