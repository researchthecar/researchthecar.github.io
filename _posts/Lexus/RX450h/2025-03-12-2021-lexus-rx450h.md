The 2021 Lexus RX 450h is a popular luxury hybrid SUV known for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and excellent fuel economy. It features a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with electric motors, producing a combined 308 horsepower and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the vehicle's reliability, quiet cabin, and luxurious features. Some common dislikes include the somewhat dated infotainment system and the less-than-sporty handling compared to some competitors.

**Electric Motor**

**3.5-liter V6 with Electric Motors**
*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hybrid system warning light illuminates, potentially accompanied by a loss of power or complete shutdown of the hybrid system. The inverter, responsible for converting DC power from the hybrid battery to AC power for the electric motors, can fail due to overheating or component malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty inverter is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be attributed to the CVT's unique operation and its programming.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can improve the CVT's responsiveness. In more severe cases, the CVT may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (Software Update), $5,000 - $7,000+ (CVT Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Rear Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of rear suspension bushings and/or rear wheel bearing failures, leading to excessive tire wear, clunking noises over bumps, or vibrations at highway speeds. This issue seems to be more prevalent in vehicles driven frequently on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings and/or wheel bearing assemblies is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, including the navigation, audio, and climate control interfaces, may freeze, lag, or spontaneously reboot. This can be due to software glitches or hardware issues.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset as described in the owner's manual. If the problem persists, a software update or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update), $1,500 - $3,000+ (Infotainment Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 12V battery draining, especially if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the parasitic draw by a qualified technician is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (Diagnosis and Repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or it may become stuck. This can be caused by a faulty liftgate motor, sensor, or hydraulic strut.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty liftgate component is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight. This is more of a cosmetic issue, but it can be unsightly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is the only permanent solution. Some owners may opt for a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (Dashboard Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
