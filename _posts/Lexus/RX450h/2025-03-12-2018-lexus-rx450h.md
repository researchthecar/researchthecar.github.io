The 2018 Lexus RX450h is a hybrid luxury SUV known for its smooth ride, fuel efficiency, and comfortable interior. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with electric motors, producing a combined 308 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. This powertrain is exclusively mated to an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). Owners often praise the RX450h for its reliability and luxurious features, but some common complaints include the infotainment system's usability and the somewhat uninspiring driving dynamics.
