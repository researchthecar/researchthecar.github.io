The 2016 Lexus RX450h is a popular luxury hybrid SUV, known for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and excellent fuel economy. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 308 horsepower. Unlike its purely gasoline counterpart (RX350), the RX450h utilizes an electronically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). People generally like the RX450h for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and quiet cabin. Common dislikes include the unintuitive infotainment system, some dated interior styling elements, and less sporty handling compared to some competitors. This document will outline common issues and complaints reported by owners, categorized by vehicle systems.

**Overall Summary:**

The 2016 Lexus RX450h generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but like any vehicle, it's not without its potential issues. The most serious and costly potential problem is high voltage battery degradation, which can significantly impact the vehicle's performance and require a costly replacement. Other notable issues include potential infotainment system malfunctions, dashboard cracking, and sensor failures. While the suspension components may wear down more quickly, this is often dependent on driving conditions. The overall severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences (infotainment glitches) to major expenses (battery replacement). Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, particularly when evaluating higher-mileage examples.
