The 2012 Lexus RX 450h is a luxury hybrid SUV known for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and excellent fuel economy. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 295 horsepower and 234 lb-ft of torque. It only came with an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). Owners generally appreciate the vehicle's reliability, fuel efficiency, and quiet cabin.

**Summary**

The 2012 Lexus RX 450h is generally a reliable vehicle, but some specific issues can arise, particularly concerning the hybrid system (battery, inverter), and the ECVT. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for suspension components or electrical issues to several thousand dollars for major repairs like hybrid battery replacement or transmission overhaul. While the RX450h does have issues, the Lexus brand's reputation for reliability and build quality will mean that most of the problems can be addressed as they arise, however, due to high labor and replacement part costs, the repairs will be expensive.
