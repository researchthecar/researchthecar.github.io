The 2020 Lexus RX450h is a popular luxury hybrid SUV known for its comfortable ride, excellent fuel economy, and reputation for reliability. It is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 308 horsepower and all-wheel drive standard. Owners often praise the RX450h for its smooth and quiet operation, luxurious interior, and comprehensive suite of safety features. However, some common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired driving dynamics, the touchpad infotainment interface which can be difficult to use, and the limited cargo space compared to some competitors.
