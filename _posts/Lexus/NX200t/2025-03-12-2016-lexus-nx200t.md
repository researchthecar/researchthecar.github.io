The 2016 Lexus NX200t is a compact luxury crossover SUV that offers a blend of comfort, style, and reliability. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine combined with an electric motor in the NX 300h hybrid (194 horsepower combined). The NX200t is equipped with a six-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid uses a CVT. People generally praise the NX for its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and Lexus reliability. Common complaints include the infotainment system's clunky interface, and some find the turbocharged engine to be somewhat underpowered at times.
