The 2017 Lexus NX 200t is a compact luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, stylish interior, and reliability. The NX 200t is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid variant, the NX 300h, was also available. Owners often praise the NX for its fuel efficiency (especially in the hybrid), comfortable seats, and comprehensive suite of standard safety features. Common dislikes include the infotainment system, which some find cumbersome to use, and the relatively small cargo area compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (200t/200)**

*   **Excessive Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct-injection engines, like the 2.0T in the NX 200t, can experience carbon buildup on the intake valves since there is no fuel passing over the valves to clean them. This can lead to rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and a loss of power.
    *   Solution: A walnut blasting service is typically required to remove the carbon buildup. Chemical cleaning methods may also be used, but are often less effective for heavy buildup. Some owners install an oil catch can to reduce the amount of oil vapor entering the intake manifold, which can contribute to carbon buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noise from the engine, loss of power, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (AWR)**
* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting, particularly during downshifts. Others experience hesitation when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can resolve the issue. Other times, the valve body needs to be replaced. In severe cases, a complete transmission replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update ($100 - $200), valve body replacement ($800 - $1500+), transmission replacement ($3,000 - $6,000+)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Inspection of suspension components (struts, shocks, control arm bushings, ball joints, sway bar links) and replacement of worn parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per corner, depending on the parts needing replacement and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning Power Liftgate**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power liftgate fails to open or close, opens or closes erratically, or makes unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the liftgate system, including the motor, struts, sensors, and control module. Replacement of faulty components, such as the liftgate motor or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, Crashing, Unresponsive Touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Software update, reset, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on the complexity of the issue and the need for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard surface, particularly in warmer climates. This is a cosmetic issue but can be unsightly.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement is the only permanent fix. Some owners use dashboard covers to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Lexus NX 200t is a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with carbon buildup in the engine, harsh shifting with the transmission, and electrical issues like a malfunctioning power liftgate or infotainment issues. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. The carbon buildup is a fairly common issue with direct-injection engines, so preventative maintenance such as walnut blasting may be a worthwhile investment.
