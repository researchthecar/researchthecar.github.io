The 2020 Lexus LC 500h is a luxury hybrid coupe known for its striking design, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency. It features a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 354 horsepower. Some owners praise its elegant interior, advanced technology features, and smooth hybrid powertrain. Common complaints, however, often revolve around its infotainment system's complexity, limited rear passenger space, and firm ride on certain road surfaces.

**Electric Motor**

**3.5L V6 Hybrid**

*   **Hybrid System Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hybrid system warning light illuminates, accompanied by reduced power or the vehicle entering a "limp mode." This can be due to various issues with the hybrid battery, inverter, or electric motor components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is required to pinpoint the specific failing component. Repair may involve replacing the hybrid battery pack, inverter, or other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the component needing replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ECVT**

*   **Hesitation or Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a slight hesitation or jerking sensation when accelerating, particularly at lower speeds. This may be attributed to the ECVT's unique operating characteristics and the interplay between the electric motor and gasoline engine.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may improve the smoothness of the acceleration. In some cases, a more thorough inspection of the transmission's internal components might be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the need for diagnosis and repair beyond a software update).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AVS system, designed to adjust the suspension damping based on road conditions and driving style, can sometimes experience malfunctions. This may manifest as a rough ride, uneven handling, or warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the AVS system's sensors, actuators, and control module. Replacement of faulty components, such as shock absorbers or sensors, may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the specific component needing replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, responsible for navigation, audio, and vehicle settings, can occasionally freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This may require a system reset or software update.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset first. If the issue persists, a software update to the infotainment system's firmware may be needed. In some cases, hardware replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for a reset) - $1,500+ (if hardware replacement is needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sensor Failures (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of parking sensors, blind spot monitoring sensors, or other driver-assistance system sensors.
    *   Solution: Faulty sensors must be replaced and recalibrated for proper operation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor (including labor and calibration).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature draining of the 12V battery, leading to starting issues or electrical malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Identify the parasitic drain through electrical testing, then replace the faulty component, or replace the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain and the battery replacement cost).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Trunk Not Latching Properly**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic trunk may fail to latch properly, requiring manual closing or repeated attempts.
    *   Solution: Adjustments or replacement of the trunk latch mechanism or related sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the extent of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Rattles/Squeaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattles or squeaks emanating from the dashboard area, particularly on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating and isolating the source of the noise, followed by insulation or tightening of the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the complexity of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Lexus LC 500h exhibits a range of potential issues, with the hybrid system and electrical components being the most concerning due to their potential cost. While issues with the transmission, suspension, and exterior are less frequent, they still contribute to the overall ownership experience. The severity of these issues can vary, but resolving them can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem and the parts required. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used LC 500h before purchase.
