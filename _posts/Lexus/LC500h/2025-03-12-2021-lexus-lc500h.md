The 2021 Lexus LC500h is a luxury hybrid coupe known for its striking design, comfortable ride, and refined interior. It combines performance with fuel efficiency, powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, delivering a combined output of 354 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque.
