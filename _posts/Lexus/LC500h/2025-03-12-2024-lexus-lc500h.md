Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2024 Lexus LC 500h, organized by category. The 2024 Lexus LC 500h is a luxury coupe known for its striking design, comfortable ride, and hybrid powertrain. The LC 500h features a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, delivering a combined 354 horsepower. While owners generally praise the car's aesthetics, fuel efficiency, and overall refinement, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system, limited rear passenger space, and the somewhat complex hybrid powertrain operation.
