**Introduction**

The 2020 Lexus NX300 is a luxury compact SUV available with two powertrain options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission and a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Both engines feature direct injection and variable valve timing. The NX300 has received praise for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and high-quality materials. However, some owners have reported issues with certain components.

**Engine**
- **2.0L Turbocharged Inline-Four**
    - **Intake Valve Deposits:** Carbon buildup on intake valves can lead to reduced engine performance, misfires, and increased emissions.
        - Solution: Intake valve cleaning and decarbonization
        - Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    - **Turbocharger Failures:** Premature failure of the turbocharger can result in reduced engine power, smoke from the exhaust, and whistling or whining noises.
        - Solution: Turbocharger replacement
        - Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
- **3.5L V6**
    - **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** A defective timing chain tensioner can lead to timing chain problems, engine misfires, and potentially catastrophic engine damage.
        - Solution: Timing chain tensioner replacement
        - Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    - **Oil Leaks:** Leaks from the oil pan gasket, valve cover gasket, or other areas can cause low oil levels and potential engine damage.
        - Solution: Gasket replacement or repair
        - Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

**Transmission**
- **Six-Speed Automatic**
    - **Shifting Issues:** Rough or delayed shifting can be caused by transmission fluid contamination, solenoid failures, or torque converter problems.
        - Solution: Transmission fluid flush, solenoid replacement, or torque converter replacement
        - Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
- **Eight-Speed Automatic**
    - **Slipping Gears:** Gears may slip or hesitate to engage, causing loss of power and rough acceleration.
        - Solution: Transmission fluid flush, valve body replacement, or transmission rebuild
        - Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    - **Electrical Issues:** Electrical faults within the transmission control unit or wiring harness can lead to erratic shifting or transmission failure.
        - Solution: Electrical component repair or replacement
        - Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

        - Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Electrical**
- **Battery Discharge:** A parasitic drain on the battery can cause the battery to discharge prematurely, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle.
        - Solution: Electrical system inspection and repair
        - Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
- **Navigation System Glitches:** Malfunctions in the navigation system can include incorrect directions, frozen screens, or software errors.
        - Solution: Navigation system software update or module replacement
        - Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
