It offers a blend of practicality and luxury that appeals to a wide range of buyers. Available engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 cylinder and a 2.5-liter inline-4 paired with an electric motor in the NX300h (hybrid) model.

Common praises include its smooth ride quality and fuel efficiency while some criticisms are a small back seat and the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (8AR-FTS)**

*   **Excessive Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 8AR-FTS can suffer from carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over them to keep them clean. This leads to rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: A professional intake valve cleaning service, such as walnut blasting, can remove the carbon deposits. Regular use of a fuel additive designed to clean intake valves can also help prevent future buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ depending on the shop and cleaning method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can fail prematurely, leading to a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. It's essential to diagnose the root cause of the failure to prevent recurrence, such as oil starvation or foreign object damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Inline-4 Hybrid (2AR-FXE)**

*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the hybrid battery pack can degrade, reducing its capacity and efficiency. This can lead to decreased fuel economy, reduced electric-only range, and the engine running more frequently. The hybrid system warning light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack. Some owners may choose to replace individual modules within the pack if feasible, but a full replacement is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $8000+ depending on the severity of the issue, whether a new or refurbished battery is used, and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Aisin U660E)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of rough or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can manifest as a noticeable jerk or hesitation during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may alleviate the issue in some cases. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be necessary, potentially pointing to issues with the valve body, solenoids, or internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush and filter: $200 - $400. Valve body repair/replacement: $800 - $2000+. Full transmission replacement: $3000 - $6000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may require a system reboot or software update to resolve.
    *   Solution: Performing a hard reset of the system or updating the software to the latest version. In some cases, a faulty head unit may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: typically free at the dealership. Head unit replacement: $500 - $2000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions in sensors such as parking sensors or blind spot monitoring systems can occur, leading to false alarms or failure to detect objects.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing the faulty sensor. This may involve recalibrating the system after the replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on the type of sensor and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks Through Sunroof/Moonroof**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the sunroof or moonroof area, leading to dampness or water stains in the interior.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the sunroof/moonroof drain channels and seals. In some cases, replacing the seals or repairing the sunroof mechanism may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Drain cleaning: $50 - $200. Seal replacement: $100 - $500. Sunroof mechanism repair: $300 - $1000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling or Squeaking Noises from Dashboard/Trim Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard or trim panels while driving, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and securing the loose components. This may involve adding padding, tightening screws, or replacing clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the repair and the time required to diagnose and fix the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Lexus NX300, while generally reliable, can experience some common issues. Engine problems such as carbon buildup and potential turbocharger failures can be costly. The transmission can also have issues with rough shifting. Electrical issues can also pop up with the Infotainment System, and sensor malfunction. The most expensive repair would likely be the replacement of the hybrid battery in the NX300h. Overall, while the issues are present, they are fairly moderate and not extremely prevalent.
