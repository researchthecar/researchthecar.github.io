The 2018 Lexus NX300 is a compact luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, upscale interior, and reliability. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid version, the NX300h, is also available, featuring a 2.5-liter inline-4 combined with an electric motor. Owners often praise the NX300 for its fuel efficiency, quiet cabin, and Lexus's reputation for dependability. However, some criticisms include the somewhat small cargo area, the infotainment system's trackpad interface, and the less-than-thrilling driving dynamics compared to some competitors.
