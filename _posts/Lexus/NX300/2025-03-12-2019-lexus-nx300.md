Here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Lexus NX300, categorized by major components. The 2019 Lexus NX300 is a compact luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, stylish interior, and reliability. It is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the NX300's fuel efficiency and smooth ride. Others dislike its infotainment system which can be cumbersome to use and small cargo area for its class.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, decreased fuel economy, and eventually a check engine light. This is common on direct-injection engines like the 2.0T due to the lack of fuel washing over the valves.
    *   Solution: A walnut blasting service to clean the intake valves. Installation of an oil catch can to mitigate future buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+ (walnut blasting), $100 - $300+ (oil catch can)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak from Water Pump**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking from the water pump area, overheating, low coolant level, and a possible check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump and coolant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or delayed shifts, particularly between lower gears. Some owners have reported the transmission feeling hesitant to downshift.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update for the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission overhaul may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (software update), $800 - $2000+ (valve body/overhaul)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bumpy ride, excessive bouncing after hitting bumps, noise coming from the front suspension, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (for both struts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failure of the Navigation/Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, Crashing, or failing to boot up at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Head Unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car has difficulty starting or requires a jump start, especially after sitting for a few days.  Could be caused by a parasitic draw.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the parasitic draw source, replacement of a faulty sensor, module or light.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking from Dashboard or Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels, particularly when driving on rough roads.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Malfunctioning Power Liftgate**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate fails to open or close properly, makes unusual noises, or stops mid-cycle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the liftgate motor, struts, or sensors. Replacement of faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the component)
