The 2000 Lexus SC300 is a luxury coupe known for its smooth ride, reliability, and timeless design. Available with either a 3.0L inline-six engine (2JZ-GE) producing around 225 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque or a 4.0L V8 engine (1UZ-FE), the SC300 and SC400, respectively, offer a blend of performance and comfort. The SC300 was offered with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the SC400 was only offered with a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the car's comfortable interior, long-lasting engine, and overall build quality. Common dislikes revolve around the aging technology, potential for rust in certain climates, and the limited rear seating.

**Engine**

**3.0L 2JZ-GE Inline-Six**
* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common due to the age of the vehicle, often originating from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, low oil level, and a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the location of the leak)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **VVTi Gear Rattle**
    * Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise from the front of the engine, particularly noticeable at idle, can indicate wear in the VVTi (Variable Valve Timing) gear assembly. This issue is more common on later 2JZ-GE engines.
    * Solution: Replacing the VVTi gear assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A340E 4-Speed Automatic**
* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The A340E transmission, especially with age, can exhibit delayed or harsh shifting between gears. This can be due to worn valve body components, low transmission fluid, or a failing torque converter.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnosis is needed, potentially involving valve body repair or replacement, or a torque converter replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid/filter) to $800 - $2000+ (major repairs)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping can be a symptom of the transmission nearing the end of it's life or an issue with the valve body or other internal components.
    * Solution: Complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: As the SC300 ages, the rubber suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.) degrade. This results in clunking noises over bumps, vague steering, and poor handling.
    * Solution: Replace the worn bushings. Polyurethane bushings are a popular upgrade for improved durability and handling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on the number of bushings replaced and labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Leaking Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Leaking or worn struts/shocks result in a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    * Solution: Replace the struts/shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (depending on brand and if replacing all four)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Dimming Instrument Cluster Lights**
    * Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster lights can dim or flicker due to failing capacitors or a faulty dimmer switch.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster or dimmer switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Antenna Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power antenna motor can fail or the mast can become bent or broken, preventing the antenna from extending or retracting properly.
    * Solution: Replace the antenna motor or mast.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can occur in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure, such as the rear wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    * Solution: Rust repair involves cutting out the rusted metal, welding in new metal, and applying rust-inhibiting primer and paint.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the severity and location)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Center Console Lid Latch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The plastic latch on the center console lid is prone to breaking, preventing the lid from closing securely.
    * Solution: Replace the latch or the entire center console lid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Climate Control Display Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The LCD display on the climate control unit can become dim or unreadable over time.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Lexus SC300, while generally reliable, does suffer from age-related issues. Common problems include oil leaks, transmission issues, suspension wear, and electrical glitches. The severity and cost of these issues can vary significantly. Oil leaks and suspension wear are typically manageable with relatively inexpensive repairs. However, transmission problems or extensive rust repair can be costly. Addressing these issues can ensure that the SC300 remains a reliable and enjoyable classic coupe.
