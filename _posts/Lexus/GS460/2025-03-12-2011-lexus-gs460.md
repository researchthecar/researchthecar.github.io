The 2011 Lexus GS460 is a luxury sedan that offers a blend of performance and comfort. It was only offered with one engine option: a 4.6-liter V8 engine that produced 342 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GS460 for its smooth ride, powerful engine, comfortable interior, and reliability. However, some common complaints include the somewhat dated infotainment system and the lack of rear seat legroom compared to some competitors.
