The 2009 Lexus GS460 is a luxury sedan offering a blend of performance and refinement. It was the top-of-the-line GS model, featuring a powerful 4.6L V8 engine producing 342 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options in the GS range that year included the 3.5L V6 (GS350) and the hybrid 3.5L V6 (GS450h). The GS460, along with the GS350 RWD, came equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the GS350 AWD and GS450h used a 6-speed CVT respectively. Owners typically praise the GS460 for its smooth ride, powerful engine, comfortable interior, and Lexus reliability. Common criticisms often revolve around its somewhat dated styling compared to newer rivals and fuel economy that is lower than the V6 options.

**Summary**

The 2009 Lexus GS460 is generally a reliable vehicle, but certain issues may arise with age and mileage. The engine can experience oil leaks and water pump failure, while the transmission may exhibit harsh shifting. Suspension issues, particularly with air suspension (if equipped) and control arm bushings, are also possible. Electrical problems may involve the navigation system and Bluetooth connectivity.
