The 2008 Lexus GS460 is a luxury sedan that offers a blend of performance and comfort. Its highlight is the 4.6L V8 engine, producing 342 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. The only other engine option for the GS line that year was the 3.5L V6 in the GS 350. A notable aspect of the GS460 is its smooth ride and quiet cabin, appreciated by those prioritizing a refined driving experience. Downsides often mentioned include somewhat dated technology compared to newer vehicles, and higher fuel consumption compared to the V6 variant. The GS460 had a 6 speed automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2008 Lexus GS460 can be a reliable car, but owners should be aware of the potential issues. Engine issues like valve cover leaks and water pump failures are relatively common, with moderate repair costs. Transmission issues, particularly torque converter shudder and harsh shifting, can be more costly to address. Suspension issues can range from moderate to expensive if equipped with air suspension. Electrical and interior issues are typically less severe but can still be annoying. Overall, while the GS460 offers a luxurious driving experience, potential buyers should factor in the costs of maintaining an older luxury vehicle.
