The 2021 Lexus UX 200 is a subcompact luxury crossover known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and stylish interior. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 169 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Direct-Shift CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). A hybrid version, the UX 250h, is also available. Owners often praise the UX 200 for its nimble handling and luxurious features but criticize its limited rear passenger space and less-than-thrilling acceleration.
