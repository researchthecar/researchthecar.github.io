The 2019 Lexus UX200 is a subcompact luxury crossover known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. It is powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 169 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a Direct-Shift Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). The UX250h is also available as a hybrid option that produces 181 horsepower. Owners often praise the UX200 for its stylish design, nimble handling, and comprehensive suite of standard safety features. However, some criticisms include its limited cargo space, somewhat lackluster acceleration, and polarizing touchpad infotainment interface.
