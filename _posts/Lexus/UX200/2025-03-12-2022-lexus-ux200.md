The 2022 Lexus UX200 is a subcompact luxury SUV known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. Its main engine option is a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 169 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Direct-Shift CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). An alternative powertrain is available in the UX 250h, a hybrid that combines a 2.0-liter inline-4 with electric motors for a combined 181 horsepower and eCVT transmission. Owners often praise the UX200 for its maneuverability, stylish design, and Lexus reliability. However, some criticisms include its limited cargo space, somewhat lackluster acceleration from the base engine, and the touchpad infotainment system which can be distracting.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to frequently check and top off the oil.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil consumption closely, performing oil consumption tests at the dealership, and potentially replacing piston rings or other engine components if consumption is excessive.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report engine misfires, especially under heavy acceleration or load. This can cause a loss of power, rough idling, and the check engine light illuminating.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the misfire (spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors, etc.) and replacing the faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electric Motor**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Direct-Shift CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **Hesitation or Jerking during Acceleration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly from a stop or at low speeds. This may be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) may alleviate the issue. In some cases, a transmission fluid change or, more rarely, transmission replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**eCVT**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Noises from Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of clunking or rattling noises emanating from the suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This can be caused by worn or loose suspension components such as sway bar links, bushings, or struts.
    * Solution: Inspecting the suspension components and replacing any worn or damaged parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing or Rebooting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the infotainment system, including freezing, lagging, or randomly rebooting. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    * Solution: Performing a system reset, updating the software, or replacing the infotainment system if the problem persists.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (system reset/software update) - $1,000+ (infotainment system replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle battery is depleted overnight or after a short period of inactivity. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from an electrical component that is not shutting down properly.
    * Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic drain and repair or replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Touchpad Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Lexus uses a touchpad infotainment control system. This touchpad can become erratic or completely stop working. The symptom is loss of control of the infotainment system.
    * Solution: Resetting the system or replacing the touchpad
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (system reset) - $800+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Lexus UX200 generally exhibits reliable performance, but some owners have reported issues with engine oil consumption, transmission hesitation, suspension noises, and electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system. The severity of these issues varies, with some requiring only minor adjustments or software updates, while others may necessitate more extensive repairs. The estimated costs for these repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage. Although some of these issues may be concerning, it's important to consider that these reports represent a small percentage of the total number of UX200 vehicles on the road.
