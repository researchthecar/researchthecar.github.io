Alright, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2016 Lexus LS600h, formatted for your website.

The 2016 Lexus LS600h is a full-size luxury hybrid sedan known for its exceptional comfort, quietness, and advanced technology. The LS600h comes equipped with a 5.0-liter V8 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 438 horsepower. Unlike the standard LS models with traditional gasoline engines, the LS600h is only available in a hybrid configuration with an electronically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). Owners often praise the car's smooth ride, opulent interior, and strong fuel economy for its class. Common complaints revolve around the complexity of the hybrid system potentially leading to higher repair costs, and some find the infotainment system dated compared to newer competitors.
