*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual decrease in hybrid battery capacity, leading to reduced fuel economy and performance. Eventually, the battery may fail completely, resulting in a warning light and the inability to drive in electric-only mode.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack. Some owners opt for refurbished batteries to save on cost.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+

    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or slippage during acceleration, particularly when the electric motor and engine transition power. Jerky shifts between drive modes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid change and software update can alleviate the problem. More severe cases may require transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $7,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can develop leaks or compressor failure. This leads to the vehicle sitting unevenly, a harsh ride, or the suspension warning light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair leaks in air struts, air lines, or the air compressor. Replacement of faulty components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per strut/compressor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with various sensors, including oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and crankshaft position sensors can cause a variety of issues including poor engine performance, check engine light, or drivability problems.
    *   Solution: Scan for diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) to pinpoint the faulty sensor. Replace the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Lexus LS600h is a luxurious and comfortable vehicle, but its complex hybrid system can lead to potentially costly repairs. The most significant concerns revolve around hybrid battery degradation, inverter failure, and air suspension issues. While some electrical and interior issues may arise, they are generally less frequent and less expensive to address than the hybrid-specific problems. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly.
