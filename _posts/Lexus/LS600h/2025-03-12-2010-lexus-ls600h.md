The 2010 Lexus LS600h is a luxury hybrid sedan, representing Lexus's flagship model with an emphasis on advanced technology and opulent features. This model exclusively features a 5.0L 2UR-FSE V8 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 438 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque. It is known for its smooth and quiet ride, luxurious interior, and advanced safety features. However, some owners have noted the complex hybrid system can lead to expensive repairs, and the fuel economy, while better than a non-hybrid V8 sedan, is not as impressive as smaller hybrid vehicles. Some also find the infotainment system to be dated compared to newer vehicles.

**Summary**

The 2010 Lexus LS600h, while luxurious and technologically advanced, suffers from some common issues that can be quite expensive to repair. The hybrid battery and ECVT transmission are major concerns, with potential repair costs reaching several thousand dollars. The air suspension and electrical system also have known problems that can add to the overall cost of ownership. While the vehicle offers a smooth and comfortable driving experience, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. Due to the age of the vehicle, many repairs will be due because of age rather than a design flaw.
