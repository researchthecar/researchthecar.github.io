The 2011 Lexus LS600h is a luxury hybrid sedan known for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and advanced technology. It features a 5.0L V8 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 438 horsepower. While owners often praise its comfort, reliability, and fuel efficiency for a car of its size, some common complaints revolve around the hybrid system's complexity, the high cost of repairs, and certain electrical gremlins. Some may also find the hybrid system and CVT-like transmission provide a less engaging driving experience compared to traditional luxury sedans.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**

*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the hybrid battery's capacity diminishes, leading to reduced electric-only range, decreased fuel economy, and potential warning lights on the dashboard. The vehicle may rely more heavily on the gasoline engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hybrid battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inverter converts DC power from the hybrid battery to AC power for the electric motor. Failure can result in a complete loss of hybrid system functionality, illuminated warning lights, and the vehicle being unable to start or drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hybrid inverter assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT)**

*   **Transmission Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing occasional jerking or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be attributed to the complex interplay between the gasoline engine and electric motor within the ECVT system.
    *   Solution: This can be addressed with a software update to the transmission. If the problem persists, you may need to have the transmission replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for a software update; $6,000 - $8,000+ for a transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LS600h often comes equipped with air suspension, which can be prone to issues such as air leaks, compressor failure, or sensor malfunctions. Symptoms include a sagging vehicle (particularly overnight), a noisy compressor, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty air struts, the air compressor, or associated sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per strut; $800 - $1,500+ for the compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System/Display Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system screen can become unresponsive, freeze, or display incorrect information. The navigation system can also drain the battery if it is not shut down properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the navigation unit or software update.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ for replacement; $100 - $300+ for a software update.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the car battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can be attributed to the complex electronics and hybrid system components continuing to draw power even when the car is off.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the parasitic draw, potentially involving replacement of faulty modules or components. Also ensure the navigation system is shut off completely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Issues (Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning parking sensors are a common issue, leading to false alarms or a complete lack of functionality.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HID headlights can experience issues with flickering, dimming, or outright failure. This could be due to faulty bulbs or ballast.
    *   Solution: Replacing the HID bulbs or ballast.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per bulb/ballast.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat motors can fail preventing seat adjustment.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Lexus LS600h offers a luxurious driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of potential issues, particularly those related to the hybrid system, suspension, and electrical components. The cost of repairs can be significant, especially when dealing with the hybrid battery or inverter. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended to identify any existing problems before purchase. Overall, the LS600h is a solid and dependable vehicle, but it does require a dedicated owner who is prepared for the potential high cost of ownership.
