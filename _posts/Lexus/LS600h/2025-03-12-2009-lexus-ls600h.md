The 2009 Lexus LS 600h is a luxury hybrid sedan, offering a unique blend of performance and fuel efficiency for its time. It's powered by a 5.0L 2UR-FSE V8 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 438 horsepower. The LS 600h only came with an electronically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). The LS600h is praised for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and advanced technology features for the time. Some common criticisms include the higher price tag compared to non-hybrid luxury sedans and the added complexity of the hybrid system potentially leading to more costly repairs.
