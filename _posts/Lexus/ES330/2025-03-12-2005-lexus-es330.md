The 2005 Lexus ES330 is a comfortable and reliable luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, quiet interior, and reputation for dependability. It came standard with a 3.3-liter V6 engine (3MZ-FE) producing 218 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised its comfortable ride, luxurious features, and Toyota-derived reliability. Criticisms often focused on its somewhat bland styling and lack of sporting performance compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.3L V6 (3MZ-FE)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, most commonly the valve cover gaskets or the crankshaft/camshaft seals. Symptoms include oil spots on the ground, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (depending on the location of the leak and labor rates)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **VVT-i Oil Line Leak (Specific to early 3MZ-FE engines)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Valve Timing intelligent (VVT-i) oil line, specifically a rubber hose component in earlier versions of the 3MZ-FE, could develop cracks and leak oil. This is a less common issue in the 2005 model year, but possible if the original hose is still in place.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rubber hose with an updated, all-metal line.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission may exhibit harsh or delayed shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. In some cases, slipping can occur, where the engine revs up but the car doesn't accelerate properly.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid flush and filter change may help. More severe cases might require valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn struts or shocks can cause a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances. Noises such as clunking or rattling over bumps are also common.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per axle (depending on brand and labor rates)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sway bar links connect the sway bar to the suspension components. When they fail, they cause a clunking noise over bumps, especially at lower speeds. It will negatively affect handling by allowing more body roll in corners.
    *   Solution: Replacement of sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty oxygen sensors (O2 sensors) can trigger the check engine light and lead to poor fuel economy and rough engine running.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty O2 sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per sensor (depending on location and labor rates)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows may fail to operate, or they may operate slowly or erratically. This is often due to a failed window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per window
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation and reduced visibility.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlight assembly and drying it out (temporary fix). A more permanent solution involves resealing the headlight housing or replacing the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (resealing) - $300+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system screen may freeze, become unresponsive, or fail to boot up.
    *   Solution: Depending on the issue, possible solutions include software updates (if available), fuse replacement, or replacement of the navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$100 (fuse replacement) - $500+ (unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the dashboard can develop cracks, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacing the entire dashboard is the ideal solution, but is expensive. Dashboard covers or repair kits offer alternative (but less aesthetically pleasing) solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (dashboard cover) - $1500+ (dashboard replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Lexus ES330 is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it is prone to certain issues. Oil leaks, suspension wear, and electrical problems are some of the more common concerns. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can be more costly to address. Dashboard cracking is a known aesthetic issue. Repair costs vary depending on the specific problem and the shop performing the work. Overall, the ES330 presents reasonable maintenance costs for a luxury sedan of its age, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
