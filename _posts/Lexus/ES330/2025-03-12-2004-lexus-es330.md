The 2004 Lexus ES330 is a luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and Toyota-derived reliability. It was only available with one engine option: a 3.3-liter V6 (3MZ-FE) producing 218 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the ES330 for its quiet cabin, comfortable seats, and reputation for longevity.

**Summary**

The 2004 Lexus ES330 is generally a reliable car, but like any vehicle, it's prone to certain issues as it ages. Engine oil leaks and suspension wear are common maintenance items. Electrical issues, while less frequent, can be more expensive to address. The dashboard cracking issue is primarily cosmetic but detracts from the car's luxury feel. The transmission is reliable, however, issues can arise that would likely require replacement or rebuild of the transmission. While some repairs, like valve cover gaskets, are relatively inexpensive, others, like a transmission rebuild or dashboard replacement, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
