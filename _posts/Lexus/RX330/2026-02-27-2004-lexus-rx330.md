### Summary Verdict

Suspension components like strut mount bearings and sway bar links can wear over time and may require attention. Electrical issues, while not pervasive, can sometimes involve the Body Control Module or alternator failure. Interior components, especially the navigation system and climate control actuators, may also develop faults. Overall, the RX330 offers excellent long-term value and dependability, with most potential issues being manageable and not indicative of fundamental design flaws.
