Oil leaks, transmission shudder, and suspension problems (particularly with the air suspension if equipped) are the most significant concerns. Electrical issues, like door lock actuator failure, can also occur. While the dashboard cracking is largely cosmetic, it is a common complaint. Repair costs can vary considerably depending on the specific issue and whether OEM or aftermarket parts are used.
