**Summary**

The 2006 Lexus RX330 is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it is prone to certain issues. Engine oil leaks and catalytic converter failure are notable concerns, as are potential transmission problems related to harsh shifting or torque converter issues. Suspension wear and electrical glitches can also occur. While some repairs, like strut replacement, are relatively inexpensive, others, such as catalytic converter replacement or transmission work, can be costly. The severity of these issues varies from vehicle to vehicle and depends largely on prior maintenance and driving conditions.
