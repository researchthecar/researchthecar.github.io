The 2004 Lexus RX330 is a luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, reliability, and upscale interior. It's powered by a 3.3-liter V6 engine producing 230 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the RX330 for its smooth and quiet operation, luxurious features, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes include a somewhat floaty suspension, less-than-sporty handling, and dated technology compared to newer vehicles.

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, timing cover, and oil pan. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine or ground, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location of the leak and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the VVT system, specifically the VVT-i actuator, can lead to rough idling, decreased performance, and a check engine light with codes related to VVT malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VVT-i actuator and potentially the oil control valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the parts and labor.
