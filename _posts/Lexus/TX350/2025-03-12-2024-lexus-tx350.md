The 2024 Lexus TX350 is a brand-new mid-size SUV offering from Lexus, positioned as a more spacious and family-friendly option. The TX350 is powered by a 2.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 275 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options include a hybrid TX500h and a plug-in hybrid TX550h+. The TX is praised for its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and ample cargo space. However, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's complexity and the perceived lack of responsiveness in certain driving situations.
