**Summary**

The 2024 Lexus GX 550 is a newly redesigned model, and as such, some early adopters are experiencing a range of issues. Some of the most concerning issues are turbo lag, a loud ticking sound from the HPFP, and harsh shifting, which could be considered moderate in severity and could be costly to repair if it requires engine or transmission replacement. Minor issues such as infotainment glitches and sunroof rattles are more common, less severe, and cheaper to fix. As the model year progresses and Lexus gathers more data, it's expected that many of these issues will be addressed through software updates and revised parts.
