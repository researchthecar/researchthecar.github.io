**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking Upon Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a hesitation or slight jerking sensation upon initial acceleration, particularly from a stop or at low speeds. This is often described as the CVT taking a moment to "find" the right gear ratio, resulting in a less-than-smooth takeoff.
    *   Solution: While there isn't a single definitive fix, some dealers have suggested software updates to the CVT control module, which may improve the responsiveness. In some cases, fluid changes have helped alleviate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (depending on if the update is covered by warranty or not)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: In some cases, tightening or replacing the rear suspension components, such as the stabilizer bar links or bushings, has resolved the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the extent of the repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or even crash, requiring a restart. This may affect navigation, audio, and other features controlled by the system.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often released by Lexus to address these issues. Applying the latest update can improve the system's stability. In some cases, a complete system reset or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $1,000+ (for unit replacement, potentially covered by warranty)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunction (Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the blind spot monitoring system or parking sensors, resulting in false alerts or complete system failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement of the affected sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the sensor and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic High Beam System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic high beam system can be overly sensitive, failing to dim the high beams when approaching other vehicles or in well-lit areas, or become disabled.
    *   Solution: Recalibration of the sensor or replacement of the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (covered by warranty) - $300+ (if not covered by warranty)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Reflection in Windshield**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The light-colored dashboard can reflect significantly in the windshield, especially in bright sunlight, potentially creating a visual distraction for the driver.
    *   Solution: This is a design issue, not a defect. Some owners use dashboard covers or apply a matte finish to the dashboard to reduce the reflection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100 (for a dashboard cover)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Lexus UX 250h generally has few serious issues. The most common complaints revolve around the CVT transmission's behavior, infotainment system glitches, and sensor malfunctions. Suspension noise and dashboard reflections are also reported. Most fixes can be resolved with software updates or sensor replacements, but some may require more costly component repairs. Severity of issues range from minor annoyances to more substantial functionality problems, and the cost of repairs can vary accordingly.
