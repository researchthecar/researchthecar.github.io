The 2019 Lexus UX 250h is a hybrid compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior for its class. The UX 250h comes exclusively with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine paired with Lexus's hybrid drive system, producing a combined 181 horsepower. While owners appreciate its nimble handling, fuel economy, and Lexus reliability, common complaints include the limited rear cargo space, the infotainment system's touchpad interface, and the slightly underpowered feel during aggressive acceleration.

**Electric Motor**

**2.0L Inline-4 Hybrid**

*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported inverter failures. Symptoms include warning lights illuminating on the dashboard, reduced power, and the vehicle potentially entering "limp mode." In some cases, the vehicle may not start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid inverter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ECVT (Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or a slight jerking sensation, particularly during low-speed acceleration or when transitioning between electric and gasoline power. This can sometimes be more pronounced on cold starts.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can improve shift quality. In other cases, replacement of the transmission may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $5,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, controlled by a touchpad, has been reported to freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot.
    *   Solution: A software update to the infotainment system may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the infotainment system unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,500+ (Infotainment System Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera image may not display, appear distorted, or flicker intermittently. This can occur randomly or after prolonged use.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections. If that doesnâ€™t fix it, replace the backup camera.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sensor Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Issues with the vehicle's sensors can cause a variety of problems, including malfunctioning safety systems (such as blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, and pre-collision system) and inaccurate readings on the dashboard. Symptoms may include warning lights, error messages, and inconsistent performance of these features.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is malfunctioning. This may involve using a diagnostic scan tool to read error codes and inspecting the sensor and its wiring for damage or corrosion. Once the faulty sensor is identified, it should be replaced with a new or refurbished unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or it may stop mid-operation. This can be due to issues with the liftgate motor, sensors, or struts.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Touchpad Controller Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners find the infotainment system's touchpad controller difficult and distracting to use while driving. It can be overly sensitive or unresponsive, making it challenging to navigate menus and select options accurately.
    *   Solution: Some drivers adjust the touchpad sensitivity in the system settings to improve usability. There is no hardware fix available, as this is a design complaint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (Software adjustments may be possible)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2019 Lexus UX 250h presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While the hybrid powertrain is generally reliable, potential inverter failures can be quite costly. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and backup camera, are common and range from minor annoyances to requiring component replacement. Interior complaints mostly center around the touchpad interface. Overall, the issues range from relatively minor (software glitches) to potentially expensive (inverter failure), so a thorough inspection and pre-purchase diagnostic check is recommended.
