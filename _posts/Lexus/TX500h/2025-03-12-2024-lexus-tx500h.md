The 2024 Lexus TX500h is a mid-size luxury SUV that offers a blend of comfort, performance, and technology. The TX500h, in particular, features a hybrid powertrain centered around a turbocharged 2.4-liter inline-4 engine. In the TX500h, this engine is paired with electric motors to produce a combined 366 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. It is important to note that Lexus also offers the TX350 which is powered by the same 2.4-liter turbocharged engine but without the hybrid system. The TX550h+ is also available, and it is a plug-in hybrid option with a 3.5-liter V6 engine and electric motors. The Lexus TX is generally praised for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and abundant features. Some common criticisms include a less engaging driving experience than some competitors and a complex infotainment system.
