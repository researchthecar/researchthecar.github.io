The 2010 Lexus HS250h is a dedicated hybrid vehicle that offered a blend of luxury and fuel efficiency. It was only offered with a single engine option: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 187 horsepower and 138 lb-ft of torque. This powertrain was exclusively mated to an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). Owners generally appreciated the vehicle's comfortable ride, fuel economy, and Lexus reliability. Common complaints revolved around the vehicle's somewhat uninspired styling, limited rear passenger space, and occasionally quirky handling.
