The 2011 Lexus HS250h is a hybrid luxury sedan known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable ride. It came with only one engine and transmission option: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine paired with an electric motor, delivering a combined 187 horsepower. Some owners appreciate the car's quiet operation, spacious interior, and Lexus reliability. However, others found the styling bland, the acceleration underwhelming compared to other luxury cars, and the infotainment system dated.
