The 2021 Lexus IS350 is a luxury sports sedan known for its refined driving experience, comfortable interior, and Lexus reliability. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (IS300 RWD), a 3.5L V6 (IS300 AWD & IS350 RWD/AWD). The IS350's 3.5L V6 produces 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque.

    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and refill *may* alleviate minor symptoms. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild/replacement might be necessary. Check solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush ($200 - $400), valve body replacement ($1,200 - $2,500+), transmission rebuild/replacement ($3,500 - $6,000+).

**Summary**

The 2021 Lexus IS350 is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the infotainment system's occasional freezing/lagging and potential transmission issues in AWD models with the 6-speed automatic. Engine problems like fuel injector leaks and water pump failure can occur, but are not widespread. Interior rattles are a nuisance but typically do not impact vehicle functionality. While some repairs like transmission rebuilds can be costly, many issues can be resolved relatively inexpensively. As with any used vehicle, a thorough inspection is recommended before purchase.
