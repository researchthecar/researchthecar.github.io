The 2018 Lexus IS350 is a popular luxury sport sedan known for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and reliable performance. The IS350 is equipped with a 3.5L V6 engine producing 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission in rear-wheel drive models or a 6-speed automatic in all-wheel drive models. Some owners appreciate the vehicle's smooth and quiet ride, upscale cabin, and reputation for dependability. Common complaints include the infotainment system, which can feel dated, and the somewhat cramped rear seating. Other engine options for the 2018 IS include the 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder in the IS300 and a lower-output version of the 3.5L V6 in the IS300 AWD.
