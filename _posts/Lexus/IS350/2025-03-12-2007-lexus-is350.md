The 2007 Lexus IS350 is a popular luxury sport sedan known for its blend of performance, reliability, and comfort. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.5L V6 (IS250) and a 3.5L V6 (IS350), with the 3.5L engine producing 306 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, though the IS250 was also available with a 6-speed manual. Owners often praise the IS350 for its smooth and powerful engine, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. However, some common complaints include issues with the dashboard cracking, carbon buildup, and potential for oil leaks.
