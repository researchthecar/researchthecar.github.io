The 2017 Lexus IS350 is a popular luxury sports sedan known for its comfortable ride, stylish design, and reliability. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 306 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While the IS350 is generally well-regarded, some owners have reported certain issues. What people tend to like about the car is its reliability, interior styling, and exterior styling.
