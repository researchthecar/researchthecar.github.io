The 2013 Lexus IS350 is a popular luxury sport sedan known for its blend of performance, reliability, and comfort. It offers a refined driving experience and a well-appointed interior. Along with the IS350, the 2013 Lexus IS lineup also included the IS250, which features a smaller 2.5L V6 engine. The IS350 is powered by a 3.5L V6 engine that produces 306 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. A common point of praise is its smooth and powerful engine, comfortable ride, and sporty handling. Some common dislikes include the somewhat cramped rear seats and an infotainment system that feels dated compared to newer models.
