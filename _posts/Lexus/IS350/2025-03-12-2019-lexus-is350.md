The 2019 Lexus IS350 is a popular compact executive sedan known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and sporty handling. Its primary engine option is a 3.5L V6 engine producing 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. A less common engine option available is a 2.0L Turbo Inline-4. Both engines are available in either Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) or All-Wheel Drive (AWD). The 3.5L V6 RWD is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.5L V6 AWD and 2.0L Turbo Inline-4 are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the IS350's luxurious interior, smooth ride, and Lexus's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated infotainment system and the less-than-spacious rear seats.
