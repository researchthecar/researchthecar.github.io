Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2020 Lexus IS 350, categorized by major components.

The 2020 Lexus IS 350 is a compact luxury sport sedan known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. It is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. All models use a six-speed automatic transmission for rear-wheel-drive models and an eight-speed automatic transmission for all-wheel-drive models. What people often like about the IS 350 is its smooth engine, comfortable interior, and Lexus' reputation for reliability. Some common dislikes include the somewhat dated infotainment system, smaller rear seat space compared to competitors, and not the most fuel efficient engine.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (2GR-FKS)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with fuel injectors failing prematurely. Symptoms include rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per injector, depending on location and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the valve spring being out of spec. Symptoms include rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Rear-Wheel Drive)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted occasional harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or during downshifts. This might be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update might resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush and software update. $800-$2000+ for valve body, $3000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (All-Wheel Drive)**

*   **Hesitation or Delay in Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported a lag or delay when shifting from a stop or during passing maneuvers. This can feel like the transmission is "hunting" for the right gear.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update may improve the shifting behavior. If the issue persists, a more in-depth diagnosis of the transmission control module (TCM) and valve body might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush and software update. More in-depth diagnostics can add additional cost.

*   **Backup Camera Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure of the backup camera, resulting in a blank or distorted image on the infotainment screen when reversing.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. If the wiring is in good condition, the camera itself may need to be replaced.
