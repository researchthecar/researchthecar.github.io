## 2018 Lexus IS350 3.5L V6 311hp, 280lb-ft

The 2018 Lexus IS350 is a luxury sport sedan that offers a blend of performance, comfort, and style. It boasts a powerful 3.5L V6 engine that delivers 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While the IS350 is praised for its responsive handling and refined interior, it has faced some reported issues.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**
* **Oil Cooler Leak:** A fault in the design of the oil cooler lines inside the rear engine bank can lead to an oil leak. Symptoms include burning oil smell, oil puddle under the car, and low oil level warnings. The solution involves replacing the faulty lines. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000
* **Valve Body Control Solenoid Failure:** This issue affects the 8-speed automatic transmission used with the 3.5L V6 engine. A faulty valve body control solenoid can cause harsh shifting, delayed gear engagement, or transmission slipping. The repair typically involves replacing the solenoid and reprogramming the transmission control module. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500
* **Transmission Control Module Malfunction:** Another issue related to the 8-speed automatic transmission is a malfunctioning transmission control module (TCM). This can result in erratic shifting, transmission overheating, or even complete transmission failure. The solution involves reprogramming or replacing the TCM. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**
* **Torque Converter Noise:** Some early model year IS350s equipped with the 8-speed automatic transmission have reported a whining or grinding noise coming from the torque converter. This issue can worsen with increasing vehicle speed. The fix involves replacing the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $3500

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Mount Noise:** Owners have complained about a clunking noise coming from the front suspension, specifically the strut mounts. This noise is usually noticeable when driving over rough roads or bumps. Replacing the strut mounts can resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000

**Electrical**

* **Electrical Short in Passenger Front Footwell:** A faulty wiring harness in the passenger front footwell can cause a short circuit. This can result in electrical problems such as blown fuses, dimming lights, or even a fire. The solution involves repairing or replacing the damaged wiring harness. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000
* **Keyless Smart Entry System Malfunction:** The keyless smart entry system on some IS350s has experienced issues with unlocking the doors or starting the car. The problem may lie with faulty door lock actuators or a malfunctioning key fob. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000

**Exterior**

* **Rear Spoiler Vibration:** The rear spoiler on some IS350s has been reported to vibrate at high speeds. This can be annoying and distracting for drivers. The fix involves adding a spoiler stabilizer or adjusting the spoiler's alignment. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Leather Rippling:** Owners have noticed a problem with the leather on the dashboard rippling or wrinkling. This is a cosmetic issue that does not affect the functionality of the dashboard. The solution may involve replacing the dashboard or having it reupholstered. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500

**Summary**

The 2018 Lexus IS350 is a reliable and luxurious sedan, but it is not without some reported issues. The engine and transmission issues can be concerning, but the other issues are generally minor and less costly to fix. Overall, the severity and cost of the problems are not significant enough to deter most buyers.
