The 2015 Lexus IS350 is a popular luxury sports sedan known for its sleek styling, comfortable ride, and reliable performance. It comes equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 306 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. While the IS250 was available with a 2.5L V6, the IS350 exclusively features the 3.5L. The rear-wheel-drive (RWD) models are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive (AWD) models utilize a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the IS350 for its smooth engine, comfortable interior, and Lexus's reputation for reliability. Common dislikes include the somewhat cramped rear seating and the infotainment system, which some find less intuitive than competitors.

**Summary**

The 2015 Lexus IS350 is generally a reliable vehicle. The most commonly reported issues involve the engine (carbon buildup and water pump failure), transmission (rough shifting, especially on the 8-speed), suspension (control arm bushing wear), and electrical system (infotainment glitches and battery drain). While dashboard cracking and sunroof issues are possible, they are less common. Most of these issues are not considered severe, but the cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the specific problem. Carbon cleaning, water pump replacement, control arm bushings, and infotainment repairs can all lead to costs of several hundred dollars or more.
