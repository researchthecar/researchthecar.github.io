The 2024 Lexus IS350 is a luxury sport sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and responsive handling. The IS350 comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission (RWD) or a six-speed automatic transmission (AWD). Other available engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a 3.5-liter V6 with lower output. Owners often praise the IS350 for its reliability, refined interior, and engaging driving experience. Common complaints center around the somewhat dated infotainment system, limited rear passenger space, and fuel economy that is not as good as some competitors.
