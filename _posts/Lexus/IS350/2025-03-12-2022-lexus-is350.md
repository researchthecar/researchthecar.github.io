Alright, here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Lexus IS 350, formatted for your website.

The 2022 Lexus IS 350 is a popular choice for those seeking a sporty and luxurious compact sedan. It features a distinctive design and a comfortable interior. The IS 350 is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission in the rear-wheel-drive configuration, or a 6-speed automatic in the all-wheel-drive configuration. Other engine options include the IS 300’s 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder and the IS 300’s 3.5-liter V6. Owners often praise its responsive handling, smooth ride, and the reliability expected from the Lexus brand. However, some criticisms include its somewhat dated infotainment system, smaller rear seats, and some have found the styling to be polarizing.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (2GR-FKS)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and potential engine damage. Faulty fuel injectors may not properly atomize fuel, leading to incomplete combustion.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per injector, depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Engine oil level drops significantly between oil changes.  May be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust. This can lead to premature wear of engine components.
    *   Solution:  First, perform an oil consumption test to quantify the issue.  Potential fixes range from replacing PCV valve to piston ring replacement or engine replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV valve) to $3,000 - $8,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (AWR8AR - RWD)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Rough or jerky shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, and potential hesitation when accelerating from a stop.  This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn valve body components, or software issues.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition.  Perform a transmission fluid flush.  If the issue persists, valve body replacement or software reprogramming may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) to $800 - $2,000+ (valve body replacement/reprogramming).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (AW30-80LE - AWD)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps.  This is more common in areas with poor road conditions. Bushings can crack and degrade prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per corner, depending on the specific bushing and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Leakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible fluid leaking from the struts/shocks, bouncy ride, reduced handling performance.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking strut/shock absorber.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800 per strut, depending on labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, lags, or becomes unresponsive.  This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions. It can occur more frequently in hot or cold weather.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reboot (if possible). Update the infotainment software to the latest version. If the issue persists, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,000 - $3,000+ (infotainment unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The backup camera displays a blank screen, distorted image, or fails to activate when the vehicle is in reverse.
    *   Solution:  Check the camera's wiring and connections. Replacement of the camera unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattling/Wind Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive rattling or wind noise from the sunroof, especially at higher speeds. This can be caused by loose seals or a misaligned sunroof mechanism.
    *   Solution:  Adjustment of the sunroof mechanism. Replacement of the sunroof seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Lexus IS 350 generally exhibits good reliability, consistent with the Lexus brand. The most significant potential issues revolve around the engine (fuel injector failure, oil consumption) and transmission (harsh shifting), although these are not widespread. Electrical issues like infotainment glitches and backup camera malfunctions are also reported. Suspension bushing wear is possible, particularly in areas with rough roads.  The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences (infotainment lag) to potentially costly repairs (engine rebuild). While the IS 350 has a solid reputation, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase.
