The 2023 Lexus IS350 is a luxury sport sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and engaging driving dynamics. It offers a blend of performance and refinement, appealing to drivers who desire a sporty yet sophisticated vehicle. The IS350 comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque.
