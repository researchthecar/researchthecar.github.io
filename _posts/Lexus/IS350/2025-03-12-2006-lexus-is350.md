The 2006 Lexus IS350 marked a significant step for Lexus in the sport sedan market. It featured a sophisticated design, a well-appointed interior, and a powerful engine. The IS350, in particular, packed a punch with its 3.5-liter 2GR-FSE V6 engine, producing 306 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2006 IS included the IS250 with a 2.5-liter V6. Both models were equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the IS350 for its smooth power delivery, comfortable ride, and Lexus reliability. However, some common complaints include the small rear seat, limited trunk space, and some specific mechanical issues that can arise with age.

**Engine**

**3.5L 2GR-FSE V6**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing the valves. This buildup can lead to rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: A manual cleaning of the intake valves, often involving walnut blasting, can remove the carbon deposits. Chemical treatments exist but are less effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Timing Cover/Valve Cover)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from the timing cover and valve cover gaskets as the engine ages. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets with new ones.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on location and complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found
