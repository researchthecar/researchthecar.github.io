The 2008 Lexus RX400h is a hybrid luxury SUV, powered by a 3.3-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 268 horsepower. There were no other engine options available for this model year. Known for its smooth ride, fuel efficiency, and luxurious interior, it's a popular choice for those seeking a comfortable and reliable hybrid SUV. However, some owners have reported issues related to its hybrid system and other components. Common praises include its quiet cabin and ample features, while complaints often revolve around the cost of hybrid system repairs and occasional issues with certain electronic components.

**Electric Motor**

* **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint is a failing or completely failed hybrid battery. Symptoms include reduced fuel economy, decreased acceleration, warning lights (check hybrid system, master warning light), and eventual inability to start the vehicle.
    * Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack is the typical solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ depending on if you use a new battery or refurbished.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Inverter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Failure of the hybrid inverter is less common but can occur. Symptoms include a sudden loss of power, warning lights, and potentially a complete shutdown of the vehicle.
    * Solution: Replacement of the inverter assembly is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

* **CVT Transmission Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The RX400h utilizes an Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT).  Some owners report issues such as hesitation, jerking, or a general lack of responsiveness, especially during acceleration or deceleration. These issues can sometimes be attributed to degradation of the transmission fluid or software glitches.
    * Solution: Fluid flush and refill, or transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400 (fluid) or $4,000 - $7,000+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some RX400h models were equipped with air suspension.  The compressor can fail, leading to the vehicle sitting low, uneven ride height, or the suspension not adjusting properly.
    * Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Air Suspension Leak (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Air leaks in the air suspension system can cause the compressor to run excessively, eventually leading to its failure. Symptoms are similar to compressor failure.
    * Solution: Locate and repair the air leak (often at the air struts/shocks) and possibly replace the compressor if it's been overworked.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per strut/shock, plus compressor cost if needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Navigation System/Display Screen Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation system can experience issues such as freezing, inaccurate GPS positioning, or a completely black screen.
    * Solution: Attempting a system reset or software update. If this fails, replacing the unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reset/update) or $500 - $2000+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power door locks may fail to operate correctly, sometimes locking or unlocking sporadically, or not responding at all.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard is a common complaint, especially in warmer climates. This is often due to the sun's UV rays and the materials used in the dashboard construction.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200 (cover) or $1,000 - $2,000+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation and reduced visibility.
    * Solution: Removing the headlights, drying them out, and resealing them.  Sometimes the headlight assembly needs to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (reseal) or $500 - $1,000+ (replacement, per headlight)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Lexus RX400h, while generally reliable, can suffer from issues, particularly related to the hybrid system (battery and inverter). These repairs can be expensive. Other less severe, but still common, problems include suspension issues, electrical glitches, and interior cosmetic concerns. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the hybrid system and be prepared for potentially high repair costs associated with it.
