The 2019 Lexus RC F is a high-performance coupe known for its naturally aspirated V8 engine and engaging driving dynamics. While it shares the RC platform with other RC models that offer a turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 and a 3.5L V6, the RC F is exclusively equipped with a 5.0L V8 engine producing 472 horsepower and 395 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People like the RC F for its distinctive exhaust note, comfortable interior, and Lexus reliability, although some find the infotainment system outdated and the fuel economy relatively poor. Others note that the handling, while good, isn't as sharp as some of its competitors.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may develop from various areas, including the valve cover gaskets and timing chain cover. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. Proper diagnosis is needed to pinpoint the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the source of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct-injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, which can reduce performance, fuel economy, and cause rough idling.
    *   Solution: Intake valve cleaning through methods like walnut blasting or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**
*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report occasional harsh shifting, particularly between certain gears, or hesitation when accelerating. This could be related to the transmission control module (TCM) or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a TCM reflash can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (TCM reflash) - $4000+ (Transmission rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**
*   **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of one or more of the AVS dampers. Warning lights on the dash indicate an issue, and the ride quality becomes noticeably worse.
    * Solution: Damper replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per damper (depending on labor rates and specific damper)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, reboot unexpectedly, or experience software glitches.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Lexus can sometimes address these issues. In more severe cases, the head unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can occur if the vehicle sits for extended periods, or due to parasitic draws from electrical components.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to isolate the component causing the drain. Replacing the battery with an updated or larger capacity battery can help prevent this issue in the future.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (battery replacement) / $100+ (parasitic draw diagnosis and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
*   **DRL (Daytime Running Light) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the DRL lights, most commonly the LED DRLs. One or more of the LED lights will fail and the DRL will appear dimmer than normal.
    * Solution: DRL replacement. If the DRL is integrated into the headlight assembly, the whole assembly may have to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000+ (headlight assembly replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**
*   **Dashboard Discoloration/Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners in hotter climates have reported the dashboard developing discoloration or cracking over time.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard panel.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000-$3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Lexus RC F is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported issues ranging from minor electrical glitches to more significant concerns like oil leaks and potential transmission problems. While the infotainment and battery issues are relatively common and less severe, engine and transmission problems can be more costly to repair. The Adaptive Variable Suspension dampers also appear to be a potential weak point. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection to assess the vehicle's condition.
