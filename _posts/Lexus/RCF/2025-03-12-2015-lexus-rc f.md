Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2015 Lexus RC F, organized by category and component.

The 2015 Lexus RC F is a high-performance coupe featuring a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 467 horsepower and 389 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the RC F for its powerful engine, engaging driving experience, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include its relatively high price point, less than stellar fuel economy, and somewhat dated infotainment system compared to newer competitors.

**Engine**

**5.0L 2UR-GSE V8**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The direct injection fuel system can lead to carbon buildup on the intake valves, especially with extended use or improper maintenance. This buildup restricts airflow, leading to rough idling, decreased performance, misfires, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: A walnut blasting service to clean the intake valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, particularly under spirited driving conditions. While some oil consumption is normal for performance engines, excessive consumption could indicate a potential issue.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and consider using a higher viscosity oil if consumption is significant. If consumption is extreme, a compression test and leak-down test can help identify the source of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil change) - $3,000+ (for engine repair or rebuild if necessary, depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**AWR8A 8-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or jerky shifts, particularly during low-speed maneuvers or when the transmission is cold. This can be more noticeable in Sport or Sport+ modes.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush, and a software reflash may resolve the issue. In some cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $1,500+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Freezing or Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may require restarting the system or, in some cases, a software update.
    *   Solution: Try restarting the system first. If the problem persists, check for available software updates from Lexus or consult a dealer.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (restart/update) - $500+ (for unit replacement if necessary)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing devices, dropped connections, or poor audio quality over Bluetooth can occur.
    *   Solution: Ensure the device is compatible, clear paired devices from the system and re-pair, or check for software updates.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (troubleshooting) - $200+ (for hardware replacement if necessary)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Folding Mirrors Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic folding side mirrors may occasionally fail to fold or unfold properly. This can be due to a motor issue or damage to the mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected mirror assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (per mirror)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dash Warping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard material can sometimes warp or bubble, especially in hotter climates. This is more of a cosmetic issue but can be unsightly.
    *   Solution: Dash replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Lexus RC F is a generally reliable performance car, but like any vehicle, it has potential issues to be aware of. The carbon buildup and oil consumption concerns with the engine are perhaps the most significant potential problems, and can be costly to address if left unmanaged. Infotainment glitches and minor trim issues can also occur. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs, emphasizing the importance of regular maintenance and thorough inspection before purchase.
