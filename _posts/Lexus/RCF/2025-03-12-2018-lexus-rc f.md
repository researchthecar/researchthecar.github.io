The 2018 Lexus RC F is a high-performance coupe known for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and engaging driving experience. Equipped with a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 467 horsepower and 389 lb-ft of torque, it offers a unique driving experience compared to its turbocharged competitors. Paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, the RC F delivers strong acceleration and confident handling. Owners often praise its distinctive styling, comfortable seats, and Lexus reliability. Common criticisms include its relatively heavy weight, which impacts agility compared to some rivals, and its infotainment system, which is often considered less user-friendly than those of other luxury brands.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    * Solution: In some cases, Lexus dealerships have performed oil consumption tests. If the vehicle exceeds the acceptable consumption rate, potential solutions include replacing valve stem seals or piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    * Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines, like the 5.0L V8 in the RC F, can be prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves. This can cause rough idling, reduced performance, and decreased fuel economy.
    * Solution: A professional intake valve cleaning service, such as walnut blasting, can remove the carbon deposits.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (AA80E)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing occasional harsh shifts, particularly during low-speed driving or when the transmission is cold. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop has also been noted.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can improve shift quality. If the issue persists, a transmission fluid flush may be beneficial. For more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $3,000+ (valve body repair/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Creaking Noises from Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported creaking or squeaking noises emanating from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning the steering wheel at low speeds. This can be caused by worn bushings, ball joints, or sway bar links.
    * Solution: Inspection of the suspension components to identify the source of the noise. Replacement of worn bushings, ball joints, or sway bar links as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the specific components needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot.
    * Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In other cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or requiring a jump start.
    * Solution: Inspection of the charging system and parasitic draws. Replacement of the battery if it is failing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (battery replacement) - $100-$300+ (diagnostics for parasitic draw)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: The dashboard of certain 2018 Lexus RC F vehicles is known to develop cracks over time, especially in hotter climates or vehicles parked outside for extended periods.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Navigation/Multimedia Screen Delamination**
    * Description/Symptoms: The thin anti-glare coating on the navigation screen can separate and bubble resulting in poor visibility and delamination.
    * Solution: Replacement of the multimedia screen
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Lexus RC F is generally a reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues. The excessive oil consumption and carbon buildup on intake valves are potentially costly engine-related problems. The transmission can experience harsh shifting, while the suspension can develop creaking noises. The electrical system can suffer from infotainment glitches and battery drain issues. Finally, owners have reported cracked dashboards and delamination of the navigation/multimedia screen. While these issues can range in severity and cost, potential buyers should be aware of them and carefully inspect any used RC F before purchasing.
