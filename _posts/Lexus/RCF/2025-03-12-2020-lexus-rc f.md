This engine delivers 472 horsepower and 395 lb-ft of torque and is paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The RC F appeals to enthusiasts who appreciate the sound and feel of a naturally aspirated V8 in a world increasingly dominated by turbocharged engines. Some common praises of the RC F include its engaging driving experience, comfortable seats, and premium interior materials. Some common complaints are that the infotainment system is difficult to use with the touchpad, and the fuel economy is relatively poor.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8 (2UR-GSE)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gaskets, and front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, the smell of burning oil, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty oxygen sensors can cause the engine to run poorly, resulting in reduced fuel economy, rough idling, and potentially triggering the check engine light. The oxygen sensors monitor the amount of unburned oxygen in the exhaust and signals the engine control unit (ECU) to make adjustments to the air-fuel mixture.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the location of the sensor and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (AA80E)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported occasional harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during downshifts. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can resolve the issue. In other cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (TCM Update), $1,000 - $2,000+ (Valve Body Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter shudder or vibration, especially at low speeds and light throttle. This can feel like a hesitation or rumbling sensation.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. A transmission flush may help in mild cases, but torque converter replacement is often the only permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The RC F is equipped with AVS, which can experience issues with the sensors or actuators. Symptoms include a warning light on the dashboard, a noticeably stiffer or softer ride than usual, or uneven handling.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific component causing the issue (sensor, actuator, or control module) and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on the failed component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system's touchpad interface can be unresponsive, glitchy, or difficult to use. Software glitches can also cause connectivity issues with smartphones.
    *   Solution: Software updates may address some issues. Component replacement may be necessary in some situations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,000+ (Component Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with various sensors, such as the parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring sensors, and tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensors. Symptoms can include error messages, warning lights, or malfunctioning systems.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Creaking/Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported creaking or rattling noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating and addressing the source of the noise. This may involve tightening fasteners, adding felt padding, or replacing worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the source of the noise. $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2020 Lexus RC F is a performance-oriented vehicle that, while generally reliable, can experience issues with its engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. Engine issues such as oil leaks can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, especially harsh shifting and torque converter issues, can impact the driving experience and lead to significant repair expenses. Suspension and electrical issues can also contribute to the overall cost of ownership. While the RC F offers an engaging driving experience and a luxurious interior, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially expensive repairs.
