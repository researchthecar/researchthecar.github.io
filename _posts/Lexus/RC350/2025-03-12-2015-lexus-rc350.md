The 2015 Lexus RC 350 is a stylish luxury coupe known for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and reliable performance. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 306 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. A less powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine was also available. The RC 350 is lauded for its smooth ride, comfortable seats, and distinctive styling. Some criticisms include the rear seats being cramped, the infotainment system being cumbersome to use, and the steering lacking some feedback. The RC 350 came with an 8-speed automatic transmission in the RWD configuration, and a 6-speed automatic transmission in the AWD configuration.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (2GR-FSE)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines, like the 3.5L V6 in the RC 350, can suffer from carbon buildup on the intake valves, as there is no fuel washing over the valves to clean them. This buildup can cause rough idling, decreased fuel economy, misfires, and a loss of power.
    *   Solution: A professional intake valve cleaning service, such as walnut blasting, is typically required to remove the carbon buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump can fail, leading to coolant leaks and potential engine overheating. Symptoms include a visible coolant leak near the water pump, engine overheating, and a whining noise coming from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**AWD 6-Speed Automatic (AWR)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or hesitant shifting, particularly when shifting between gears at lower speeds. This can manifest as a noticeable jerk or delay during gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush: $200-300, Valve Body Replacement: $1500+, Transmission Rebuild: $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**RWD 8-Speed Automatic (AA80E)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or hesitant shifting, particularly when shifting between gears at lower speeds. This can manifest as a noticeable jerk or delay during gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush: $200-300, Valve Body Replacement: $1500+, Transmission Rebuild: $3000+

**Suspension**

*   **Creaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report hearing creaking noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning at low speeds. This can be caused by worn-out bushings, ball joints, or sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components, such as bushings, ball joints, or sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the component(s) needing replacement, but typically $200 - $800+ per corner.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Freezing or Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation and infotainment system can sometimes freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot while driving.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Identification and repair of the parasitic draw. In some cases, the battery may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis: $100+, Battery Replacement: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Lexus RC 350 is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it has some potential issues. The most significant concerns relate to carbon buildup on the intake valves of the engine, which can affect performance. Transmission issues such as rough shifting can occur. Some owners have reported issues with the infotainment system freezing or rebooting. Dashboard cracking is another commonly cited issue that is prevalent. While the majority of these issues aren't catastrophic, they can be costly to repair, especially if a full transmission rebuild or dashboard replacement is needed. Addressing issues promptly and performing regular maintenance can help keep the RC 350 running smoothly.
