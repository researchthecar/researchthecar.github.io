The 2020 Lexus RC350 is a luxury coupe known for its comfortable ride, stylish design, and reliability. The RC350 is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 and a 3.5L V6 paired with a hybrid electric motor. The 3.5-liter V6 is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission (RWD) or a 6-speed automatic transmission (AWD). Owners often praise the RC350 for its smooth ride, upscale interior, and Lexus's reputation for dependability. Criticisms often focus on the infotainment system's usability, the relatively small rear seats, and the somewhat uninspiring handling compared to some sportier rivals.
