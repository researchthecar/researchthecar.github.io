Here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Lexus RX450hL, organized by category and powertrain configuration.

The 2019 Lexus RX 450hL is a luxury crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency (thanks to its hybrid powertrain), and upscale interior. The "L" designation signifies a longer wheelbase and a third-row seat, albeit a somewhat cramped one. The sole powertrain option for the 450hL is a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with a hybrid system. The engine produces 259 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque, while the total system output is 308 horsepower. Owners generally appreciate the smooth and quiet ride, the high-quality interior materials, and the reliability associated with the Lexus brand. Criticisms often include the less-than-spacious third-row seating, the somewhat dated infotainment system (controlled by a touchpad), and the higher price point compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 Hybrid (2GR-FXS)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the "low oil" warning light illuminating and the need to add oil quarts before the next service. The cause can be attributed to piston ring design or valve stem seal issues.
    *   Solution: A dealer oil consumption test to verify the issue. Depending on the results, the fix could involve replacing the piston rings or valve stem seals. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary, although rare.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported slow coolant leaks which need to be topped off periodically. If left alone, it could result in overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**eCVT (Electronically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh shifting, particularly at low speeds or when accelerating from a stop. This may be more noticeable in colder weather.
    *   Solution: Begin by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change may resolve the issue. In some cases, a software update for the transmission control module (TCM) may be available. If the problem persists, valve body issues may be present requiring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid change), $1,500 - $3,000+ (valve body replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (navigation, audio, climate controls) may freeze intermittently or spontaneously reboot while driving. This can be frustrating and distracting.
    *   Solution: A software update for the infotainment system is often the first step. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update if under warranty), $800 - $2,000+ (head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Touchpad Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system touchpad is unresponsive or inaccurate, making it difficult to navigate menus and control system functions.
    *   Solution: Try recalibrating the touchpad in the system settings. If that doesn't work, the touchpad may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ (touchpad replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Tailgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power tailgate may fail to open or close properly. The motor may sound weak, or the tailgate may stop mid-cycle.
    *   Solution: Check the tailgate struts for wear. Replace the tailgate struts. Check the tailgate motor or the sensors that detect obstructions, if these are damaged, replace them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on part(s) replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noise from Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling noises emanating from the dashboard area, particularly when driving on rough roads. The source of the rattle can be difficult to pinpoint.
    *   Solution: A careful inspection by a technician is required to identify the source of the rattle. The fix may involve tightening loose components, adding padding, or replacing damaged parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source and complexity of the fix)
    * Recalls: None Found
