The 2021 Lexus RX450hL is a popular luxury hybrid SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior (especially in the 3-row L version), and fuel efficiency. The RX450hL comes with a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with a hybrid system, producing a combined 308 horsepower. Unlike the standard RX models, there is no gasoline-only model option for the RX450hL. Reviewers often praise the RX450hL's smooth powertrain and quiet cabin but sometimes criticize its somewhat numb handling and dated infotainment system. Common owner dislikes also include the third-row seating being cramped and cargo space compromised when the third row is in use.
