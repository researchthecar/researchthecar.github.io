The 2022 Lexus RX 450hL is a hybrid SUV offering three rows of seating. Its hybrid powertrain combines a 3.5-liter V6 engine with electric motors, delivering a combined output of 290 horsepower. Unlike the standard RX, the 450hL provides additional seating, although the third row is best suited for children or smaller adults. Common praises for the RX 450hL include its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and Lexus's reputation for reliability. Criticisms often focus on its somewhat dated infotainment system, limited cargo space behind the third row, and the less-than-thrilling driving experience. The RX450hL only comes with the 3.5-liter V6 hybrid motor.
