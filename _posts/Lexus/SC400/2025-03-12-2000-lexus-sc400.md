The 2000 Lexus SC400 is a luxurious grand tourer known for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and reliable performance. It came exclusively with a 4.0L 1UZ-FE V8 engine producing 300 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the SC400 for its build quality, dependability, and timeless design. Some criticisms include its slightly dated technology, fuel economy compared to modern cars, and limited rear seat space.

**Engine**

**4.0L 1UZ-FE V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common around the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal. This can lead to reduced oil levels, visible oil spots under the car, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. Thoroughly clean the affected area before installing new parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location of the leak and labor rates.

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Degradation of rubber hoses and plastic components in the cooling system can lead to leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage. The radiator itself can also develop leaks over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing aged hoses, the thermostat, radiator, and performing a coolant flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the components replaced.

**Transmission**

**A650E 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the transmission fluid can degrade, or the valve body can become worn or clogged, leading to delayed shifts, harsh shifting, or slipping.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush (if the fluid is not severely degraded) and replacing the filter. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush and filter. $800 - $2000+ for valve body work or transmission rebuild.

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shock absorbers can wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and increased braking distances.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ for all four corners, depending on the brand of parts used and labor rates.

*   **Control Arm Bushings Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per control arm, depending on whether just the bushings are replaced or the entire arm.

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The capacitors in the instrument cluster can fail, leading to dim or flickering displays, inaccurate readings, or complete failure of the cluster.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding or replacing the instrument cluster. Some repair shops specialize in capacitor replacement, which can be a more affordable option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the repair method.

*   **Power Antenna Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power antenna motor can fail or the antenna mast can become bent or damaged, preventing the antenna from extending or retracting properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the antenna motor or the entire antenna assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the repair.

**Exterior**

*   **Weather Stripping Deterioration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weather stripping around the doors and windows can dry out and crack over time, leading to wind noise and water leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected weather stripping.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per piece, depending on location.

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Lid Hinge Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hinge on the center console lid is prone to breaking, preventing the lid from staying closed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the entire center console lid or repairing the hinge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the solution.

**Recalls:** None Found

**Summary:**

The 2000 Lexus SC400 is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it is prone to certain issues. Common problems include oil leaks, cooling system degradation, and transmission shifting issues. Suspension components and electrical issues can also arise. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission work or instrument cluster repair, can be more costly. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more serious problems that can impact drivability and require significant investment to address.
