**Engine**

**4.0-liter V8**

* **Cam Position Sensor Failure**
  * Description/Symptoms: The cam position sensor monitors the position of the camshafts and sends signals to the engine control unit. A faulty sensor can lead to rough idling, hesitation, and poor engine performance.
  * Solution: Replace the cam position sensor.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $250
  * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
  * Description/Symptoms: The valve cover gasket seals the valve cover to the cylinder head, preventing oil leaks. A worn or damaged gasket can cause oil leaks, which can lead to engine damage if left unattended.
  * Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500
  * Recalls: None Found

* **Exhaust Manifold Leak**
  * Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold connects the engine to the exhaust system. A cracked or warped manifold can cause exhaust gases to leak, leading to a noticeable exhaust noise and reduced engine performance.
  * Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
  * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Solenoid Failure**
  * Description/Symptoms: Transmission solenoids control the flow of fluid in the transmission, allowing for smooth gear changes. A faulty solenoid can cause shifting problems, such as delayed shifts, harsh shifts, or a lack of response from the transmission.
  * Solution: Replace the faulty solenoid.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
  * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Lockup Issue**
  * Description/Symptoms: The torque converter locks up to improve fuel efficiency at highway speeds. A malfunctioning torque converter can cause shuddering or vibration during acceleration, or a lack of power transfer at high speeds.
  * Solution: Replace or repair the torque converter.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000
