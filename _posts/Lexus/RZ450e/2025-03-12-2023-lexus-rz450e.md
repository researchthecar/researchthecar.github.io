The 2023 Lexus RZ450e is Lexus's first dedicated battery-electric vehicle, offering a blend of luxury and eco-consciousness. It features a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system, delivering a combined output of 308 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. While praised for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and luxurious interior, some owners have voiced concerns over range limitations, infotainment system quirks, and certain build quality issues. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential drawbacks alongside the vehicle's strengths.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Motor AWD**

*   **Reduced Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners report the actual range of the RZ450e falling significantly short of the EPA estimated range of 220 miles. Real-world conditions such as cold weather, highway driving, and aggressive acceleration can drastically reduce the available range. This causes anxiety when planning longer trips.
    *   Solution: There is no mechanical fix for this issue, and owners are mostly encouraged to adjust their driving habits to maximize range. Some owners are using aftermarket software/applications to get a more accurate reading.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery/Charging**

*   **Slow DC Fast Charging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have complained about the slow DC fast charging speeds compared to other EVs in its class. While the car can theoretically charge at up to 150 kW, many owners report lower charging speeds in real-world conditions, especially when the battery is above 50% capacity. This can make road trips and quick top-ups less convenient.
    *   Solution: None, this is an inherent limitation of the vehicle's charging system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, including the large touchscreen display, can sometimes freeze or lag, making it unresponsive to inputs. This can affect navigation, audio controls, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from Lexus may resolve this issue. Some owners have reported temporary fixes by restarting the system (typically by holding the power button).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update may be free, but labor costs at a dealer may apply.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Connectivity Issues (Wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent disconnections or difficulty connecting to wireless Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. This can disrupt navigation, music streaming, and phone calls.
    * Solution: Check for software updates for both the car and your smartphone. Try using a different USB cable or a wired connection as a troubleshooting step. In some cases, a dealer software update might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update may be free, but labor costs at a dealer may apply.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Spoiler Alignment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported minor misalignments in the rear spoiler.
    *   Solution: This would likely require adjustment or replacement of the spoiler assembly by a Lexus dealer.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Warranty Repair if applicable
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Panel Gaps**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported inconsistent gaps between exterior body panels, particularly around the doors, hood, and trunk.
    *   Solution: Body panel adjustments by a qualified technician.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Warranty Repair if applicable
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Creaking/Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported creaking or rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Locating and insulating the source of the noise. This may require dealer intervention to properly diagnose and address.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Depends on the source. May be covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occasional problems with the sunroof mechanism, including sticking, slow operation, or unusual noises when opening or closing.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the sunroof tracks or replacing the sunroof motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Lexus RZ450e, while luxurious and technologically advanced, has encountered some notable issues. The primary concerns revolve around the electric motor's reduced range compared to its advertised numbers and slow DC fast charging speeds.
