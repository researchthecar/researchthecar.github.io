The 2024 Lexus RZ450e is Lexus's first global all-electric vehicle, offering a blend of luxury and zero-emission driving. The RZ450e comes standard with a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system producing a combined output of 308 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. Many owners praise the RZ450e for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and Lexus's reputation for reliability. However, some criticisms include the relatively short driving range compared to competitors and the somewhat uninspired interior design. The RZ450e doesn't have traditional engine and transmission options as it is a fully electric vehicle.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Electric Motor AWD**

*   **Reduced Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the actual driving range of the RZ450e is significantly lower than the EPA-estimated range of 220 miles (depending on the trim). Factors like driving style, weather conditions, and use of climate control can heavily impact the range. This is a common complaint, especially in colder climates.
    *   Solution: There is no immediate fix for this issue, as it is inherent to the vehicle's battery capacity and energy consumption. Owners are advised to adjust driving habits, pre-condition the battery when possible, and optimize climate control settings to maximize range. Lexus has not yet offered a software update to specifically address range concerns.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inconsistent Power Delivery**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some drivers have noted that the power delivery from the electric motors can feel inconsistent or surge unexpectedly, particularly in certain drive modes or at specific speeds. This can make smooth acceleration challenging.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration could potentially smooth out the power delivery curve. Check with the Lexus dealership for any available software updates for the power control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates performed under warranty are typically free.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Slow DC Fast Charging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Compared to some other EVs on the market, the RZ450e's DC fast charging speeds have been criticized as being slower than expected. This can lead to longer charging times when using public fast chargers.
    *   Solution: This issue is limited by the vehicle's charging architecture. There is no easy fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported occasional glitches in the infotainment system, including screen freezes, slow response times, and Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Try restarting the infotainment system by holding down the power button. If the problem persists, a software update from the dealership might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Typically covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Software Bugs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various minor software bugs have been reported, such as incorrect data display, issues with the Lexus app connectivity, and occasional error messages.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Lexus should address these issues. Keep the infotainment system updated to the latest version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Typically covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Alignment**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported minor misalignment issues with the rear hatch, leading to uneven gaps or difficulty closing the hatch smoothly.
    *   Solution: The dealership can adjust the hatch alignment to ensure proper closure and even gaps.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Adjustments are typically covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Creaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced creaking noises from the dashboard or other interior trim pieces, particularly in colder weather.
    *   Solution: Dealership technicians can apply felt tape or other noise-dampening materials to the affected areas to reduce the creaking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Minor adjustments are typically covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver Monitoring System Errors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous alerts from the driver monitoring system (if equipped), such as falsely detecting driver inattentiveness, have been reported.
    *   Solution: The system's sensitivity can be adjusted in the vehicle settings. If the problem persists, the sensor may need to be recalibrated or replaced by the dealership.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Typically covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Lexus RZ450e is generally a reliable vehicle, typical of the Lexus brand. The most common issues reported are related to the vehicle's electric powertrain, particularly the reduced real-world range and slower DC fast charging speeds. Other reported issues are more minor in nature, such as infotainment glitches, software bugs, and interior creaking noises. The majority of these issues are likely to be covered under warranty, and the severity of the problems is generally low to moderate. However, potential buyers should be aware of the range limitations and ensure that the RZ450e's charging characteristics meet their needs.
