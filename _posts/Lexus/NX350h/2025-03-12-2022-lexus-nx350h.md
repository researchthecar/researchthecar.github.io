The 2022 Lexus NX350h is a luxury compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and smooth ride, thanks to its hybrid powertrain. The NX series also offers a NX250 with a 2.5L Inline-4 with 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. There is also a NX350 that is equipped with a turbocharged 2.4L Inline-4 with 275 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. The NX450h+ is a plug in hybrid with a 2.5L Inline-4 and an electric motor. The NX350h features a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 240 horsepower. Drivers generally appreciate its comfortable interior, user-friendly technology (after software updates), and Lexus's reputation for reliability. Common criticisms include the initial learning curve of the infotainment system, some road noise at higher speeds, and the sometimes-uninspiring acceleration compared to non-hybrid competitors.
**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or randomly reboots. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control features integrated into the system. Some users report this occurring frequently, while others experience it sporadically.
    *   Solution: Lexus released several software updates to address these issues. Owners should ensure their system is running the latest software version. In some cases, a complete system reset or hardware replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: If software update does not fix it, infotainment replacement is $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wireless Charger Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wireless phone charger does not consistently charge devices, or stops charging intermittently. Some users have also reported the charger overheating their phones.
    *   Solution: Try a different phone or phone case. In some cases, the wireless charger unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling noises coming from the dashboard, doors, or rear cargo area. These noises are often more noticeable on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle is crucial. Dealership technicians can use specialized tools to pinpoint the location and apply sound dampening material or tighten loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may not open or close properly, or may stop mid-operation. This can be due to sensor malfunctions, motor problems, or issues with the liftgate struts.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate sensors for obstructions. Resetting the system by disconnecting the car battery for a short period may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the motor or struts may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the component replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Hybrid**
*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported engine misfires, particularly during cold starts or under heavy acceleration. This can cause rough idling, loss of power, and illumination of the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking spark plugs, ignition coils, and fuel injectors. A faulty sensor could also be the cause. Replacement of the affected component is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a hesitation or lag in acceleration, especially from a stop or when trying to pass another vehicle. This can be attributed to the CVT's programming and response characteristics.
    *   Solution: A software update from Lexus might improve the CVT's responsiveness. In some rare cases, a transmission replacement may be necessary if the issue is due to internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: If software update does not fix it, $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Lexus NX350h presents a mix of minor and potentially more significant issues. The infotainment system problems and rattling noises are relatively common but often addressed with software updates or minor repairs. The engine misfires and transmission hesitation can be more concerning, potentially leading to higher repair costs. Overall, while the NX350h generally lives up to Lexus's reputation for reliability, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and ensure any used models have been properly maintained and updated.
