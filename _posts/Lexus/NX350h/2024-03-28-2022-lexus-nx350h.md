**Introduction: Lexus NX350h**

The 2022 Lexus NX350h is a hybrid luxury compact SUV powered by a 2.5L four-cylinder engine paired with electric motors. It boasts 240 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. The NX350h is known for its smooth ride, comfortable cabin, and impressive fuel efficiency. However, some owners have reported various issues with their vehicles.

**Engine**

**2.5L Hybrid**

* **Engine oil leaks:** Oil can leak from the rear main seal or the valve cover gasket. Symptoms include a burning oil smell, oil spots under the vehicle, and low oil levels. The fix involves replacing the affected gasket, which costs approximately $500-$1,000.
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket may fail, causing rough idling, power loss, and check engine light illumination. The solution is to replace the gasket, which costs around $300-$500.

**Transmission**

* **CVT transmission issues:** The continuously variable transmission (CVT) can develop problems, such as slipping, shuddering, or hesitation during acceleration. Repair or replacement of the CVT can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000.

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension noise:** Some vehicles may experience knocking or popping noises from the front suspension. The issue is typically caused by worn or damaged upper control arms. Replacing the control arms costs around $500-$800 per side.
* **Rear suspension spring failure:** The rear suspension springs may fail prematurely, leading to a bouncy ride and uneven handling. The solution is to replace the springs, which costs approximately $200-$300 per spring.

**Electrical**

* **Battery depletion:** The 12V battery can prematurely discharge, causing the vehicle to lose power or not start. The issue can be caused by a faulty battery or parasitic drain. Replacing the battery costs $150-$250, while diagnosing and repairing electrical issues can vary depending on the cause.
* **Infotainment system glitches:** The infotainment system may experience occasional glitches, such as freezing, lagging, or displaying incorrect information. Software updates or module replacements can resolve the issues.

**Exterior**

* **Headlight condensation:** Condensation can form inside the headlight assemblies, which can affect visibility at night. The headlights need to be replaced, costing around $400-$600 per assembly.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard creaks and rattles:** The dashboard or center console may develop creaks or rattles, particularly over rough roads. The issue can be addressed by applying foam padding or tightening loose screws.
* **Panoramic sunroof wind noise:** Owners have reported excessive wind noise coming from the panoramic sunroof. The problem can be resolved by adjusting or lubricating the sunroof tracks.

**Summary**

The 2022 Lexus NX350h is generally a reliable vehicle, but it has experienced some issues, particularly with its engine and transmission. While most repairs are not excessively expensive, the cost can vary depending on the extent of the problem. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and have their vehicles regularly inspected to prevent or address them as necessary.
