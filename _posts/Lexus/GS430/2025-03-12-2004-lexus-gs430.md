**Engine**

**4.3L (3UZ-FE) V8**

*   **Oil Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, the front crankshaft seal, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil spots on the ground beneath the vehicle, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the typical solution. Depending on the location of the leak, the repair can be relatively straightforward (valve cover gaskets) or more involved (rear main seal, requiring transmission removal).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,500+ depending on the location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensors Failing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensors can fail over time, leading to a check engine light and potentially reduced fuel economy and performance. The car might experience rough idling or hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor(s) is the standard fix. Diagnostic tools are used to identify the specific sensor(s) that need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT-i) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the VVT-i system can lead to rough idling, reduced power, and a check engine light. This can be due to oil sludge buildup or failing VVT-i solenoids.
    *   Solution: Flushing the engine to remove sludge and replacing the VVT-i solenoids are common solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (A650E)**

*   **Shifting Problems/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or delayed shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can sometimes be attributed to low transmission fluid or worn-out solenoids within the transmission.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, replacing the affected solenoids or rebuilding the transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system, if equipped, can develop leaks in the air struts or compressor failure. This can lead to the car sitting unevenly or not maintaining the correct ride height, and the "Check Suspension" light illuminates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air struts or a faulty compressor is the typical solution. Converting to a traditional coilover suspension system is another (often more reliable) option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut, $500 - $1,500+ for compressor, $1,000 - $3,000+ for coilover conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Deteriorated control arm bushings can cause clunking noises in the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can also negatively affect the car's handling and alignment.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly is the fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$800+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen can fail or become dim, making it difficult to use. In some cases, the entire unit might stop functioning.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the navigation screen or entire unit. Some owners opt for aftermarket replacements.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on repair vs. replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Seat Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power seats may stop functioning correctly, with motors failing or switches malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty motors or switches.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation and reduced visibility.
    *   Solution: Sealing the headlight housings to prevent moisture intrusion. Some owners drill small drain holes to allow moisture to escape.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (sealing), potentially much more for replacing the entire headlight assembly.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacing the dashboard (expensive) or installing a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ (replacement), $50 - $200+ (cover).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Lexus GS430 is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any car of this age, it is prone to certain issues. The most common problems revolve around oil leaks, suspension components (especially air suspension), and electrical malfunctions. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others, such as air suspension repairs or dashboard replacements, can be costly. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the car for these potential issues and factor in the cost of potential repairs when considering a purchase. Overall, the severity of issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially significant expenses, making a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic highly recommended.
