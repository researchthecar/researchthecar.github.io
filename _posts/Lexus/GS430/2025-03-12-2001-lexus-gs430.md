The 2001 Lexus GS430 is a luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and reliable performance. The GS430 comes equipped with a 4.3-liter V8 engine (300 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque). Other engine options for the 2001 Lexus GS series include the GS300, which features a 3.0-liter inline-six engine. Both engines are paired with a five-speed automatic transmission.
