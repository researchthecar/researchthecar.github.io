**Overall Summary**

The 2006 Lexus GS430 offers a luxurious and reliable driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues related to its age. Engine oil leaks and torque converter shudder are relatively frequent, but typically not catastrophic. Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension (if equipped), can be costly to repair. Electrical problems with the navigation screen and power windows are also possibilities. While some issues, like dashboard cracking, are cosmetic, others can affect performance and safety. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more significant repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the problem. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential issues.
