Here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2011 Lexus GS450h. This luxury hybrid sedan combines performance with fuel efficiency. The 2011 GS450h is only available as a hybrid model. The hybrid system combines a 3.5L V6 engine with an electric motor and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The hybrid system produces a combined 335 horsepower. Many owners appreciate the vehicle's smooth ride, luxurious interior, and relatively good fuel economy for its class.

**Battery**

* **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gradual decrease in fuel economy, warning lights on the dashboard (e.g., "Check Hybrid System"), reduced power, or complete failure of the hybrid system. This is a common issue as the battery ages.
    * Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack. Some owners opt for refurbished batteries as a more cost-effective alternative, but this may come with a shorter lifespan.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Lexus GS450h, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The most concerning and potentially costly issue is hybrid battery failure and CVT transmission issues. Air suspension failures can also be costly. Electrical problems with the infotainment system can be frustrating, but are typically less expensive to address. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of maintenance and potential repairs when considering this vehicle. Regular maintenance, especially of the hybrid system and cooling system, is crucial to extending the lifespan of the vehicle and minimizing potential problems.
