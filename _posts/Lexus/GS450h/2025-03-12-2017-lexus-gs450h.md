The 2017 Lexus GS 450h is a luxury hybrid sedan that blends performance with fuel efficiency. It features a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 338 horsepower. There were no other engine options available for the 2017 GS 450h. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is the only transmission available. Owners generally appreciate the GS 450h for its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and fuel economy for its class. Some common criticisms include a smaller-than-average trunk due to the hybrid battery, and the infotainment system's interface. While the GS 450h does not have a fully-electric motor, the following sections will address some of the issues people are having.

**Electric Motor**

**3.5L V6 Hybrid**

*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, decreased acceleration, and a warning light on the dashboard indicating a problem with the hybrid system. Over time, the hybrid battery's capacity diminishes, impacting the car's overall performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack. Sometimes individual modules can be replaced, but a full replacement is typically recommended for longevity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inverter converts DC power from the hybrid battery to AC power for the electric motor. Failure can result in the car not starting, a loss of power while driving, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the inverter assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a slight jerking or hesitation during low-speed acceleration, particularly when the electric motor and gasoline engine transition. This is often attributed to the unique characteristics of the CVT and the hybrid system's interaction.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can improve the CVT's performance. If the issue persists, a CVT fluid change might be recommended. In severe cases, CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $300 (fluid change) - $4,000 - $7,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (navigation, audio, climate control) can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or unexpectedly reboot.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealership may resolve the issue. In some cases, the head unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000 - $3,000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation System GPS Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: GPS stops working. The car does not know the location, and navigation is unavailable.
    *   Solution: The GPS unit will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **LED Headlight Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the LED headlights. This can manifest as flickering, dimming, or complete failure of one or more LED elements within the headlight assembly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire headlight assembly is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+ per headlight.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the dashboard material, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement is the only permanent solution. Some owners opt for dashboard covers as a temporary fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Lexus GS 450h is generally a reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with the hybrid system (battery and inverter), the CVT, the infotainment system, LED headlights, and dashboard cracking. The most potentially costly repairs involve the hybrid battery, inverter, or CVT replacement, which can range from $3,000 to $7,000 or more. Software updates and minor repairs are generally less expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and inspect the vehicle thoroughly, especially the hybrid system's performance, infotainment system functionality, and headlight condition.
