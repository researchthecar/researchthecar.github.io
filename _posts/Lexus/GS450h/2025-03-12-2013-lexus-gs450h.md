*   **eCVT**
    *   **Transmission Hesitation/Jerking**
        *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This may be related to the complex interaction between the electric motor and the gasoline engine within the eCVT.
        *   Solution: A software update to the hybrid control system may alleviate the issue. In some cases, a more extensive inspection of the eCVT may be required.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnostic fees can range from $100 - $200+. Software updates may be covered under warranty or cost around $100 - $300. If the transmission needs to be rebuilt or replaced, this could cost thousands.
