The 2009 Lexus GS450h is a luxury hybrid sedan that was known for its smooth ride, fuel efficiency, and advanced technology for its time. It features a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 335 horsepower and ample torque for responsive acceleration. While it's praised for its reliability and luxury features, some owners have reported certain issues over time. Unlike the standard GS models, the GS450h only came with one powertrain option. Dislikes often revolve around the higher maintenance costs associated with hybrid systems compared to traditional gasoline vehicles.
