The 2015 Lexus GS450h is a hybrid luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and excellent fuel economy for its class. It features a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 338 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque. The non-hybrid GS models offered a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder and a 3.5-liter V6. Owners generally praise the GS450h for its reliability, quiet cabin, and the seamless integration of the hybrid system. Some common criticisms include the smaller trunk space due to the hybrid battery pack and the somewhat dated infotainment system.

**Electric Motor**

**3.5L V6 Hybrid System**

* **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced electric-only range, decreased fuel economy, error messages related to the hybrid system, and the engine running more frequently.
    * Solution: Replacing the hybrid battery pack is often the only solution. Some owners explore rebuilding the battery pack by replacing individual cells, but this is less common.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Inverter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The inverter converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the motor. Failure can lead to a complete loss of hybrid system function, resulting in the car running only on gasoline if possible or becoming completely immobile. Error messages and warning lights will illuminate.
    * Solution: Replacing the inverter is the typical solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Failure (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The GS450h could be equipped with AVS. Failure of the system can result in a harsh or uneven ride, warning lights on the dashboard, and the system failing to adjust damping properly. Individual shock absorbers may leak or fail.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected shock absorbers or other AVS components. Diagnose which parts need replaced and replace them.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per shock absorber, depending on location and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Screen freezes, unresponsive touch controls, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and issues with the navigation system.
    * Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In more severe cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software updates (if available); $1,000 - $3,000+ for head unit replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Trunk Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power trunk may fail to open or close automatically, requiring manual operation. The trunk may get stuck or only work intermittently.
    * Solution: Replacing the power trunk actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking or warping of the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    * Solution: Dash replacement or dash cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ for replacement; $100 - $300 for a dash cover.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **LED Headlight Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Flickering, dimming, or complete failure of the LED headlights.
    * Solution: Replacing the LED headlight assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+ per headlight assembly.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Lexus GS450h is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues related to the hybrid system, particularly battery degradation and inverter failure, which can be costly to repair. Adaptive suspension components and electrical gremlins can also arise. Dashboard cracking and headlight malfunction are also potential issues. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs potentially ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. Overall, while reliable, the hybrid components and electronic features add complexity that can lead to relatively expensive repairs as the vehicle ages.
