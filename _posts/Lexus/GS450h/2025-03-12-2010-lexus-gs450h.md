**Electric Motor**

**3.5L V6 Hybrid System**

*   **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, warning lights on the dashboard (e.g., "Check Hybrid System"), diminished acceleration, and eventual inability to start the vehicle. The battery management system can also trigger false codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack. In some cases, individual modules within the battery pack can be replaced if the overall battery is in good condition, but a full replacement is more common.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, complete loss of hybrid system functionality, warning lights, and potential shutdown of the vehicle. Can also trigger the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid inverter assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**3.5L 2GR-FSE V6**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves (Direct Injection)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, hesitation upon acceleration, reduced fuel economy, and potential misfire codes. This is a common issue with direct injection engines as there is no fuel washing over the intake valves.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the intake valves through methods like walnut blasting or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, low oil level, and potential engine damage if not addressed. Common leak points include valve cover gaskets, timing cover, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the location of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ECVT (Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging, uneven ride height, prolonged compressor run time, warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor. It's often recommended to replace the relay at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to compressor failure â€“ vehicle sagging, uneven ride height, and a bouncy ride. Hissing sound may be audible from the strut.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut (depending on location and whether aftermarket or OEM parts are used)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System/Infotainment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response, inaccurate GPS, screen malfunctions, and Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available), replacement of the navigation unit, or repair of the screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity and solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mark Levinson Audio Amplifier Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: No sound from speakers, distorted sound, or intermittent audio output.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the Mark Levinson amplifier.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Lexus GS450h, while generally reliable, can present some costly issues related to its hybrid powertrain, particularly the hybrid battery and inverter. Carbon buildup on the engine and suspension issues (if equipped with air suspension) are also potential concerns. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and audio amplifier can be frustrating. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for expensive repairs, especially concerning the hybrid components.
