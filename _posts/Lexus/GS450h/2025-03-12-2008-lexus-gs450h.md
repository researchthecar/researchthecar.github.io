The 2008 Lexus GS450h is a luxury hybrid sedan known for its smooth ride, fuel efficiency, and relatively powerful hybrid powertrain. It combines a 3.5-liter V6 engine with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 335 horsepower. While the GS line also included the GS350 and GS460 with traditional gasoline engines and automatic transmissions, the GS450h was the only hybrid option. People generally praise the GS450h for its comfortable interior, quiet operation, and innovative technology for its time. Common complaints often revolve around the high cost of repairs, especially related to the hybrid system, and the relatively small trunk space due to the battery pack.
