The 2003 Lexus SC430 is a luxury coupe/convertible known for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and reliable Toyota/Lexus engineering. It came equipped with a single engine and transmission option: a 4.3L 3UZ-FE V8 engine producing 300 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's quiet operation, refined driving experience, and attractive styling. Some common complaints include limited rear seat space, dated technology features, and a somewhat soft suspension tuning that prioritizes comfort over sporty handling.
