**Engine**

**4.3L 3UZ-FE V8**

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common as the car gets older from the valve cover gaskets. You may notice oil dripping onto the exhaust manifold causing a burning smell. You may also notice oil accumulating around the valve covers.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oxygen sensors on the 4.3L 3UZ-FE V8 engine can fail over time, leading to poor fuel economy, rough idling, and the illumination of the check engine light. Diagnostic codes P0135, P0155, P0130, or P0150 might be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Transmission**

**Aisin A761E 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or delayed shifting, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, or occasional slipping. This can be due to low transmission fluid, worn solenoids, or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. If needed, perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system, if equipped, can experience issues such as compressor failure, leaking air struts, or ride height sensor malfunctions. This can result in a saggy ride, uneven ride height, or a failure to adjust the suspension.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific issue (compressor, strut, sensor) and replace the faulty component. It is important to have the air suspension system properly calibrated after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per strut depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises when driving over bumps, vibrations in the steering wheel, and imprecise handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm depending on if the full assembly or just the bushing is replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation Screen/Radio Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen can fail or become unresponsive. Radio controls may become intermittent or completely stop working.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component that is failing. It could be the navigation unit, amplifier, or individual controls. Component replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the failed component and if it can be repaired or needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Convertible Top Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power retractable hardtop mechanism can experience issues, such as getting stuck halfway, failing to open or close completely, or exhibiting slow operation. This can be due to hydraulic pump issues, faulty sensors, or worn gears in the mechanism.
    *   Solution: Inspect the hydraulic fluid level and pump. Check all sensors and wiring related to the convertible top mechanism. Lubricate moving parts and replace worn components as necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (minor repairs) - $2,000+ (major hydraulic component replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
