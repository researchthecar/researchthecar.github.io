*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various areas, including the valve cover gaskets, timing cover, and crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, the smell of burning oil, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VVTi (Variable Valve Timing) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the VVTi system, leading to rough idling, decreased engine performance, and the check engine light illuminating with codes related to VVTi solenoids or actuators.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty VVTi solenoid or actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin A761E 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a shudder or vibration during light acceleration, typically between 30-45 mph. This can be caused by wear in the torque converter or contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush might help in some cases, but often replacing the torque converter is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1500+, depending on whether a flush is sufficient or the torque converter needs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension System Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some SC430s were available with an optional air suspension system. Issues can include sagging suspension, a rough ride, and the air suspension compressor failing.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty air struts, the air compressor, or related components. Converting to a traditional coilover suspension is also a common alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+, depending on the components replaced and whether a coilover conversion is performed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Lower Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the front lower ball joints can lead to clunking noises, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory navigation screen can develop issues such as pixelation, dimming, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the screen or sending it out for repair. Aftermarket navigation upgrades are also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Retractable Hardtop Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the retractable hardtop mechanism are relatively common. These can range from slow operation and squeaking noises to complete failure to open or close. This can be caused by low hydraulic fluid, faulty sensors, or a failing motor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific issue and replacing the faulty components, such as hydraulic cylinders, sensors, or the motor. Ensure proper maintenance and lubrication of the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+, depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found
