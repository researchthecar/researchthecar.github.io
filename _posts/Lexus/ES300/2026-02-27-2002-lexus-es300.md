### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Lexus ES300 is a highly reliable vehicle with a strong track record. The powertrain is generally bulletproof, and most reported issues are minor and related to age rather than inherent design flaws. Common areas to inspect include the timing belt (ensure it's been replaced on schedule), potential oil leaks from valve cover gaskets, and age-related wear on suspension components like strut mounts and bushings. Electrical gremlins are infrequent but can include window regulators and alternators. Interior wear, such as dashboard cracking, is more cosmetic but can be costly to repair. Overall, it remains a solid choice for a dependable used luxury sedan, provided it has been reasonably maintained.
