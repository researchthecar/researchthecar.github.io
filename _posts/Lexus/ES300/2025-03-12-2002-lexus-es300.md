*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common as the car ages. Frequently the valve cover gaskets and the front crankshaft seal deteriorate over time, leading to oil dripping onto the exhaust manifold or pooling on the engine block. Symptoms include the smell of burning oil, visible oil leaks, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets and/or crankshaft seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on which seal or gasket needs to be replaced and if it is a DIY job or not.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a notorious issue with this engine if proper oil change intervals are not followed. Sludge can clog oil passages, leading to reduced oil pressure and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a ticking noise from the engine, especially on startup, and potentially a low oil pressure warning light.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil. If sludge is present, an engine flush may be necessary, or in severe cases, engine disassembly and cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1,000+ depending on the severity and approach.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shift Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may experience harsh or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid can sometimes alleviate minor shifting issues. However, more serious problems may require transmission repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll during cornering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ for all four struts/shocks and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The control arm bushings can crack and wear, causing clunking noises from the suspension, especially over bumps, and affecting alignment.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on if you replace the whole control arm assembly or just the bushings.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensors can fail, leading to poor fuel economy, rough idling, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor, depending on location and if it is a DIY job or not.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows may fail to operate, or operate slowly and erratically.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can occur in areas prone to moisture and salt exposure, such as the wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing rusted panels. Rust prevention measures, such as applying rust inhibitors, can help mitigate the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per area, depending on the extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard material can crack and split due to prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover to protect it from further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on replacement or repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found
