The 2001 Lexus ES300 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, reliability, and smooth operation. It was available with only one engine option: the 3.0-liter 1MZ-FE V6 engine, producing 210 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car for its quiet cabin, plush ride, and Toyota-derived reliability. However, common complaints include its somewhat bland styling, lack of sporty handling compared to competitors, and the age-related issues that come with owning a vehicle of this vintage.

**Engine**

**3.0L 1MZ-FE V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often stemming from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or the front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ depending on the location of the leak and whether it is being done by a dealership, private shop, or individually.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While not as prevalent as in some other Toyota engines, the 1MZ-FE can suffer from sludge buildup if oil changes are neglected. This can lead to poor engine performance, rough idling, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Performing engine flushes (with caution) or, in severe cases, engine cleaning or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 for a flush, $500+ for more extensive cleaning, $2000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The IAC valve can become clogged or malfunction, leading to rough idling or stalling, particularly when the engine is cold or when coming to a stop.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shift Flare**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shift flare occurs when the transmission momentarily slips between gears, resulting in a noticeable increase in engine RPMs before the next gear engages. This is most noticeable between 2nd and 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and/or replacement. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250 for fluid service, $1500 - $3000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, especially when shifting between gears at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by dirty transmission fluid, faulty solenoids, or internal damage. Start with a fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, further diagnostics may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250 for fluid service, $200+ for solenoid replacement, $1500 - $3000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn struts and shocks are common on vehicles of this age. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, excessive body roll when cornering, and bottoming out over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ for all four corners.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises in the suspension, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per control arm, depending on whether bushings or the whole arm is replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: O2 sensors can fail, leading to poor fuel economy, rough running, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty O2 sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate or operate erratically due to a failing regulator.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding/Yellowing**
