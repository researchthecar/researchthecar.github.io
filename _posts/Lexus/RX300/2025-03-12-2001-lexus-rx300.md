**Summary**

The 2001 Lexus RX300 is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car of this age, it's prone to certain issues. Engine oil leaks and transmission problems are fairly common and can be costly to repair. Suspension components also wear over time, requiring replacement. Electrical issues such as oxygen sensor failures and power window malfunctions are also potential concerns. Interior features like the navigation screen (if equipped) can also be problematic. Overall, while many issues can be minor and inexpensive, potential buyers should be aware that some repairs can be costly, especially if the vehicle has not been well-maintained.
