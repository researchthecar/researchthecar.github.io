The 2003 Lexus RX 300 is a popular luxury crossover SUV known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. It came with a single engine and transmission option: a 3.0-liter 1MZ-FE V6 engine producing 220 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the RX 300's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and Lexus dependability. However, some common complaints include the relatively low fuel economy for its class and age, some issues with the vehicle's age, as well as issues related to the car being driven for many years.

**Engine**

**3.0L 1MZ-FE V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common in older 1MZ-FE engines, often stemming from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the location of the leak and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 1MZ-FE engine uses a VVT-i system. Over time, the VVT-i actuator can fail. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the VVT-i actuator or solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can develop slippage, especially when shifting between gears. This is often due to worn clutch packs, low transmission fluid, or a failing valve body.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might temporarily alleviate the issue. However, a more permanent solution involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush and filter, $2000 - $4000+ for rebuild or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks can wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ for all four, depending on parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The control arm bushings can wear out causing clunking noises during bumps, vibrations at higher speeds, and poor alignment.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per control arm, depending on whether just the bushings or the entire arm is replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working or operate slowly due to a failing window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensor failure can cause a check engine light, poor fuel economy, and rough idling.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Lighting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bulbs in the instrument cluster can burn out, causing parts of the cluster to be unreadable in the dark.
    *   Solution: Replace the burnt-out bulbs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on labor and the number of bulbs needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof motor can fail, or the sunroof tracks can become clogged or damaged, leading to the sunroof not opening or closing properly.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the sunroof motor or clean/repair the sunroof tracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the severity of the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen can fail, display errors, or become unresponsive, rendering the navigation system unusable.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the navigation screen or unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Climate Control Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the climate control system, such as the AC not blowing cold air or the heater not blowing hot air, can occur. This may be due to a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Repair the refrigerant leak, replace the compressor, or replace the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on the specific issue and parts needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Lexus RX 300 is generally a reliable vehicle, but its age means that certain issues are more common. Engine oil leaks and transmission slippage are potential concerns. Suspension components like struts and control arm bushings are also prone to wear. Electrical problems such as window regulator failure and O2 sensor failure can occur as well. Interior components such as navigation screens may require repairs due to age. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major issues like transmission rebuilds can be costly. Addressing these common problems can help extend the life and reliability of a 2003 Lexus RX 300.
