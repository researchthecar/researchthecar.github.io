**Summary**

The 2002 Lexus RX300 remains a generally reliable vehicle, but its age means that certain issues are becoming more prevalent. Engine oil leaks, transmission shifting problems, and suspension wear are common concerns. Electrical issues, such as power window failures and instrument cluster lighting problems, can also occur. Interior components, like the navigation and climate control screens, may also fail due to age. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance items when considering purchasing a used RX300. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds, can be quite costly.
