**Summary**

The 2015 Lexus ES 350 generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but owners have reported a few common issues. Oil leaks, particularly from the timing cover and valve cover gaskets, are among the more costly engine concerns. The 6-speed automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and backup camera have also been noted. Dashboard cracking can occur. While these issues can be bothersome, they are not necessarily widespread and should be considered in the context of the vehicle's overall solid reliability. Repair costs range from relatively inexpensive fixes like fluid flushes and gasket replacements to more substantial expenses like timing cover resealing, transmission rebuilds, or head unit replacements.
