**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (2GR-FKS)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. The amount of oil consumed varies, but can be significant enough to warrant concern. This can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: In some cases, dealerships have performed oil consumption tests and, if deemed excessive, may replace piston rings or the entire engine under warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: If not under warranty, piston ring replacement could range from $2,000 - $4,000+, and engine replacement could cost $6,000 - $10,000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing issues with fuel injectors failing. This may lead to rough idling, misfires, and/or stalling.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic to determine which fuel injector has failed and replace the faulty injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+, depending on the injector and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (AWR80E)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update of the transmission control module (TCM) can improve shifting smoothness. In more severe cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update $100 - $200. Valve body replacement $1,000 - $2,000+.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Rattles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises coming from the dashboard, often related to the dashboard materials expanding and contracting with temperature changes.
    *   Solution: Locating and isolating the source of the rattle, and then using felt tape or other sound-dampening materials to secure the loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on severity and location of rattle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Lexus ES 350, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The most concerning relate to excessive oil consumption and potential transmission issues, which could be costly to repair if not under warranty. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and backup camera are also relatively common.
