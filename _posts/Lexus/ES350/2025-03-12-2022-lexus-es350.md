The 2022 Lexus ES 350 is a popular luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, elegant styling, and reliability. The most common engine option is the 3.5-liter V6, producing 302 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. An ES 250 with a 2.5-liter inline-4, 203-horsepower engine is also available, and an ES 300h hybrid combines a 2.5-liter inline-4 with an electric motor. All ES 350 models use an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically appreciate the ES 350's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample features. Some common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired handling, infotainment system interface, and conservative styling (depending on the trim level).
