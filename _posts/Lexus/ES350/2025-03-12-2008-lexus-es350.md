The 2008 Lexus ES 350 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, reliability, and luxurious interior. It was offered with only one engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 272 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the smooth ride, quiet cabin, and reputation for longevity, but some dislike the somewhat bland styling and less engaging driving experience compared to some competitors.
