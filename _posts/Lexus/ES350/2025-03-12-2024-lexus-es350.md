Here's a comprehensive compilation of reported issues and complaints for the 2024 Lexus ES 350, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2024 Lexus ES 350 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and reputation for reliability. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 302 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some appreciate its smooth and quiet operation, luxurious features, and strong resale value. However, some criticisms include its somewhat uninspired handling, less sporty driving dynamics compared to some competitors, and a infotainment system that some find less intuitive than others. A hybrid version, the ES 300h, is also available, featuring a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine coupled with an electric motor. This report focuses primarily on the ES 350 with the V6 engine.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (2GR-FKS)**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of rough idling, misfires, and reduced fuel economy. There's speculation that these issues might be related to direct fuel injectors experiencing premature failure or clogging.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injectors with updated versions. A thorough cleaning of the fuel system may also be advised.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover gaskets onto the engine. Symptoms include a burning oil smell, visible oil around the valve covers, and potentially low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Aisin AWF8F35)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hard or jerky shifts, especially during lower gear changes (1st to 2nd, 2nd to 3rd). Hesitation or delay when accelerating from a stop has also been reported.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM) resolves the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $100 - $300, Valve Body Replacement: $800 - $1500+, Transmission Rebuild: $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Knocking or clunking noises coming from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Inspection reveals excessive play or cracking in the suspension bushings (control arms, sway bar links).
    * Solution: Replacing the worn suspension bushings. In some cases, the entire control arm may need to be replaced if the bushings are not available separately.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner, depending on which bushings/arms are replaced
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (navigation, audio, climate control interface) occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or spontaneously reboots.
    *   Solution: Checking for software updates. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: $0 - $200, Unit Replacement: $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitor, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alarms or complete failure of sensors like the blind spot monitor, parking sensors, or lane departure warning system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor(s) and replacing them. Calibration of the sensor system may also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, plus calibration costs.

**Summary**

While the 2024 Lexus ES 350 maintains a reputation for reliability, some owners have reported issues ranging from minor annoyances to more significant mechanical problems.
