The 2021 Lexus ES 350 is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, refined interior, and strong reliability. It is most commonly equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 302 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. While other engine options exist, such as the 2.5-liter inline-4 available in the ES 250, the ES 350 with its V6 is the more popular choice. A hybrid version, the ES 300h, is also available. Owners often praise the ES 350 for its smooth and quiet ride, luxurious interior, and comprehensive suite of standard safety features. Some common dislikes include the somewhat uninspiring driving dynamics and the infotainment system's touchpad interface, which can be distracting to use while driving.
