The 2007 Lexus LS460 is a luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, quiet interior, and comfortable features. The LS460 was offered with a 4.6L V8 engine producing 380 horsepower and 367 lb-ft of torque, coupled with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some owners praise the car's reliability and luxurious appointments, while others have reported issues with suspension, electrical components, and interior features. The LS460 aimed to provide the ultimate luxury experience, but like all vehicles, it has its potential problem areas.

**Engine**

**4.6L 1UR-FSE V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between changes. The engine might emit blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Addressing excessive oil consumption can range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive repairs like replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. A leak-down test can help determine the source of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV valve) to $3000+ (piston rings/valve stem seals)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT-i) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VVT-i system might develop problems, leading to rough idling, decreased performance, and potentially a check engine light. Common causes include faulty VVT-i solenoids or oil control valves.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific VVT-i component at fault and replace it. Regular oil changes with the correct viscosity can prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the specific component and labor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **8-Speed Automatic Transmission (A760E)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh shifting, particularly between certain gears, or delayed engagement. This can sometimes be attributed to a worn valve body or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might resolve minor issues. A valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild may be necessary for more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) to $4000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system, designed for a smooth ride, can develop leaks in the air struts, a failing compressor, or issues with the height sensors. Symptoms include the car sitting unevenly, a "suspension height low" warning light, or a noisy compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air struts, the air compressor, or the height sensors is the typical solution. Converting to a coilover suspension is also an option that eliminates the air suspension system entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per strut, $400-$1000+ for the compressor, $1500-$3000+ for coilover conversion
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen can fail, become unresponsive, or display incorrect information. The Mark Levinson sound system can also have issues.
    *   Solution: Depending on the issue, the navigation system might need to be reset, updated, or replaced. Repair or replacement of the head unit, amplifier, or individual speakers may be necessary for audio problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience a parasitic drain on the battery, causing it to die prematurely, especially if the car sits unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the drain (e.g., a faulty module, a light left on) is key. This often requires a professional electrical diagnosis.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (diagnosis and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Trunk Lid Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic trunk lid may fail to open or close properly, or it might make unusual noises during operation. This can be due to a faulty motor, struts, or sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty trunk motor, struts, or sensors can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard is prone to cracking, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Dash replacement or using a dash cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (dash cover) to $1500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Lexus LS460 presents a mix of potential issues. Suspension and electrical problems tend to be the most common and costly to repair, with air suspension issues being a frequent concern. While engine and transmission issues are less common, they can still be expensive if they arise. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential pitfalls and factor them into their purchasing decision, including budgeting for thorough pre-purchase inspection and potential repairs.
