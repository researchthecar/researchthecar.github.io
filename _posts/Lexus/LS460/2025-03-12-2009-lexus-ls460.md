**Engine**

**4.6L 1UR-FSE V8**

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing valve spring failure, leading to misfires, rough idling, and potentially engine damage. This issue may be more prevalent in earlier models.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty valve springs is the standard fix. In severe cases, the cylinder head may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of damage.

*   **Timing Cover Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks originating from the timing cover are not uncommon as the engine ages. The leak may start small but can worsen over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing cover gasket and resealing the cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+ depending on the labor rate.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leak at Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported oil leaks developing at the VVT actuator located near the front of the engine. Symptoms include visible oil leaks and a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replacing the VVT actuator and associated seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1500+

**Transmission**

**A761E 8-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, or slipping between gears. This can be attributed to wear or malfunction of the valve body.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body is the common fix. In some cases, a transmission flush and fluid replacement can temporarily alleviate the issue, but a new valve body is required for a long-term fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ depending on whether the valve body is rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LS460 offered an optional air suspension system. Problems include sagging, uneven ride height, or a completely deflated suspension. This is typically caused by leaks in the air struts or a failing air compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts and/or air compressor. Converting to a coilover suspension system is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per strut, $800-$1,500+ for the compressor. Coilover conversion can range from $2,000 - $4,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose or wandering steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn control arm bushings or, in some cases, the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may become unresponsive, flicker, or completely fail. This can be due to a faulty LCD screen or a problem with the navigation unit itself.
    *   Solution: Replacing the navigation screen or the entire navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the component replaced and whether it's a new or refurbished unit.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mark Levinson Amplifier Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of sound from one or more speakers, distortion, or complete amplifier failure.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains overnight or within a short period, leading to difficulty starting. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.

**Summary**

The 2009 Lexus LS460 offers a luxurious driving experience but can experience some issues common to older, high-end vehicles. The most concerning issues are engine-related, specifically valve spring failure and timing cover leaks, due to the high cost of repair. Air suspension problems, if equipped, and electrical glitches can also contribute to higher maintenance costs. While not all LS460s will experience these issues, potential buyers should be aware of them and factor potential repair costs into their purchasing decision.
