The 2016 Lexus GS200t is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and reputation for reliability, though it isn't without its potential issues. The GS200t is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 2016 Lexus GS was also available as the GS 350 which came with a 3.5L V6 and the GS 450h which came with a 3.5L V6 Hybrid. Owners appreciate the GS200t's smooth handling and comfortable seats, but some have cited the infotainment system as unintuitive and the engine as lacking the power of some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (8AR-FTS)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct-injection engines, like the 2.0L turbo in the GS200t, can experience carbon buildup on the intake valves. Symptoms include rough idle, decreased fuel economy, hesitation during acceleration, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: A walnut blasting or chemical cleaning of the intake valves to remove carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant may leak from the water pump. Symptons include loss of coolant and white smoke coming from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**AWR8AR 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can manifest as a noticeable clunk or hesitation during acceleration or deceleration.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush/software update) - $1,000+ (valve body/rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The suspension bushings (especially on the lower control arms) can wear prematurely, leading to clunking noises when going over bumps or during turning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings or, in some cases, the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per corner depending on the extent of the damage and whether the entire control arm needs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. If not, the infotainment system unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update, if available) - $1,000+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Oxygen Sensor**
    * Description/Symptoms: The O2 sensors are known to fail. They can be diagnosed by using an OBDII scanner.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Summary**

The 2016 Lexus GS200t is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues like carbon buildup, rough shifting, and infotainment system glitches. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. While some repairs like suspension bushings are relatively inexpensive, problems with the infotainment system or transmission can be significantly more costly. Overall, most issues are not severe and can be resolved with proper maintenance.
