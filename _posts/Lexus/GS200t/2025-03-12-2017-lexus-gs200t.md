The 2017 Lexus GS 200t is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and reliability. The 200t designation signifies the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine, which produces 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2017 GS model year include a 3.5-liter V6 (GS 350) and a hybrid variant (GS 450h). Owners generally appreciate the GS 200t's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and Lexus' reputation for dependability. Common complaints include the somewhat small rear seat and the infotainment system's less-than-intuitive interface.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (8AR-FTS)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines, like the 8AR-FTS, are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over the valves to clean them. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased fuel economy, hesitation during acceleration, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: A walnut blasting service or chemical cleaning of the intake valves is typically required to remove the carbon buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure. Symptoms include a loss of power, whistling or whining noises from the engine bay, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A8 (8-Speed Automatic)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly when the transmission is cold. In some cases, this can also occur when shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and refill with the correct type of fluid might resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a software update or valve body replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $1,500+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (including the navigation and audio controls) can occasionally freeze or reboot unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: A software update from the Lexus dealership often resolves this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Typically covered under warranty or a nominal fee for software update if out of warranty (around $100-$200).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the car sits unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: A parasitic drain test can help identify the source of the drain. Possible causes include faulty door actuators, lights not turning off properly, or a failing battery. Replacing the battery may be necessary, along with addressing the source of the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic High Beam Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Automatic high beams may not turn on or off as expected, or may flicker intermittently.
    *   Solution: This issue may stem from the windshield-mounted camera sensor or the automatic high beam module. Replacement of the sensor or module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation Screen Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The anti-glare coating on the navigation screen can delaminate, creating a cloudy or blotchy appearance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the navigation screen unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Lexus GS 200t is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners may encounter issues such as carbon buildup on the engine, harsh shifting in the transmission, infotainment system glitches, battery drain, delamination of the navigation screen, and possible turbocharger failures. Most of the issues are considered moderate in terms of severity and can range in cost from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars to repair. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase.
