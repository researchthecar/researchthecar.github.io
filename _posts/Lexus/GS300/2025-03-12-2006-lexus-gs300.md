The 2006 Lexus GS300 is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a blend of comfort, reliability, and performance. The GS300 is equipped with a 3.0L 3GR-FE V6 engine, producing 245 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. The other engine options available for the 2006 GS series were the GS430 (4.3L V8) and the GS450h (3.5L V6 Hybrid). The GS300 came equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the GS300 for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and Lexus's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes often revolve around the somewhat dated technology compared to newer vehicles, and sometimes the less-than-thrilling performance compared to its V8 counterparts.

**Engine**
