**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder (8AR-FTS)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing the valves. This buildup can restrict airflow, leading to rough idling, decreased performance, reduced fuel economy, and potentially trigger the check engine light.
    *   Solution: A walnut blasting service to clean the intake valves. Chemical intake cleaners can also help but are not as effective as walnut blasting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

The most common issues reported involve the infotainment system and potential carbon buildup on the engine's intake valves. Infotainment glitches, while annoying, can often be resolved with software updates, while the carbon buildup issue, common to direct-injection engines, may require periodic cleaning. LED Headlight failure is also not uncommon. Most of these issues are not considered extremely severe, but repairs can be moderately expensive, especially for headlight and infotainment-related fixes.
