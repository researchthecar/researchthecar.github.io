The 2004 Lexus GS300 is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride, a well-appointed interior, and Lexus reliability. The primary engine option for the 2004 GS300 is the 3.0L 2JZ-GE inline-six engine, producing around 220 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. A small amount of GS430s were produced with a 4.3L 3UZ-FE V8 producing around 300 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. All models of the GS300 were available with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's smooth ride, build quality, and overall dependability. Common complaints include a somewhat dated interior, and in the case of the GS300, a less powerful engine compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**3.0L 2JZ-GE Inline-Six**

* **VVTi Gear Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: A rattling or knocking sound coming from the front of the engine, especially on cold starts. This is caused by wear in the Variable Valve Timing (VVTi) gear.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ depending on labor rates and shop.

* **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets & Camshaft Seals)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket or camshaft seals. Visible oil drips or oil smell.
    * Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets and camshaft seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

* **Ignition Coil Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, check engine light with codes indicating a cylinder misfire.

**Transmission**

**A650E 5-Speed Automatic**

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement into gear, harsh shifts between gears, especially when cold. This is often due to worn valve body components or low transmission fluid.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change may help. Valve body rebuild or replacement is sometimes necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush) to $800 - $2000+ (valve body or transmission replacement)

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration.
