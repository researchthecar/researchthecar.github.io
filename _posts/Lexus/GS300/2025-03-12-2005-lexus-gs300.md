The 2005 Lexus GS300 marked the beginning of the third generation for this luxury sedan. It was available with two engine options: a 3.0-liter inline-6 (2JZ) and a 4.3-liter V8. The 2005 GS300 came equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission. For this breakdown, we will focus specifically on the 3.0-liter inline-6 engine option. The engine produced 245 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the car's comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and reliability. Common complaints include the somewhat dated infotainment system and the car's fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.0L Inline-6 (2JZ)**

*   **Valve Stem Seal Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blue smoke upon startup, especially after the car has been sitting for a while. This indicates oil leaking past the valve stem seals into the cylinders while the engine is off.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve stem seals. This is labor-intensive as it may require removing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine rattle upon startup, reduced engine performance, and a check engine light with codes related to the VVT system. This may indicate issues with the VVT-i actuator or the oil control valve.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific issue with the VVT system, which could involve replacing the VVT-i actuator or the oil control valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on the specific part and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the car, especially near the front. Common leak points include the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially during light acceleration or cruising. This can be a sign of torque converter lock-up clutch failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose or vague steering feel. Uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings. Sometimes, replacing the entire control arm assembly is more practical.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm, depending on whether the bushings are replaced separately or the entire arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and longer stopping distances. Fluid leaks from the strut/shock absorber.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts/shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ for a set of struts/shocks and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or displays incorrect information. The GPS may lose its signal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the navigation unit or sending it in for repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on repair vs. replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**

**Summary**

The 2005 Lexus GS300, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. The engine can experience valve stem seal leaks and VVT system problems, while the transmission might develop torque converter issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts are also prone to wear. Electrically, the navigation system and power window regulators can fail. Finally, cosmetic issues like headlight lens clouding and dashboard cracking can occur. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to more costly repairs. It's wise to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems before buying a used 2005 GS300.
