The 2002 Lexus GS300 is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, elegant styling, and Toyota reliability. It was offered with one engine choice: a 3.0-liter inline-six (2JZ-GE) producing 220 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and overall build quality. However, common complaints include the age-related issues that come with a 20+ year old vehicle, such as failing sensors, worn suspension components, and interior trim pieces that can become brittle. Additionally, the fuel economy is not as competitive as newer vehicles, and the infotainment system is outdated by today's standards.

**Engine**

**3.0L Inline-Six (2JZ-GE)**

*   **Oil Leaks from Valve Cover Gasket**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning oil smell. Visible oil seepage around the valve cover is also common.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VVT-i Gear Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Valve Timing intelligent (VVT-i) system can sometimes develop issues due to wear or oil sludge. This can lead to rough idling, decreased performance, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly inspect the VVT-i system. Replace the VVT-i gear, OCV (oil control valve), and clean or replace any clogged oil passages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the water pump or radiator. Can lead to overheating and engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the water pump or radiator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A650E 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit delayed engagement, especially when shifting into drive or reverse. Harsh shifting between gears is also a common complaint.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be needed, including inspection of the valve body and solenoids. A transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, and strut mounts can cause clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. The car may also exhibit vague steering or wandering.
    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension bushings. A complete suspension refresh may be necessary for optimal performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaking Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking struts or shocks result in a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the struts or shocks. Replacing them in pairs is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oxygen sensors (O2 sensors) can fail due to age and exposure to exhaust gases, leading to a check engine light, reduced fuel economy, and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty O2 sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Actuator Issues**

**Summary**

The 2002 Lexus GS300 is generally a reliable car, but as with any vehicle of this age, it is prone to certain issues. The most common problems involve oil leaks from the valve cover gasket and worn suspension components. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster lighting issues and O2 sensor failures, are also relatively common. Transmission issues, such as delayed or harsh shifting, can be expensive to fix if a rebuild or replacement is required. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
