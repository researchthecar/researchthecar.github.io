The 1999 Lexus LS400 is a luxury sedan powered by a 4.0L V8 engine and paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. With 290 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, it offers a refined driving experience along with high levels of comfort and technology. Despite its overall reliability, the LS400 has some notable issues.

**Engine**

- **4.0L V8**
  - **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gaskets, specifically the lower intake manifold gasket, can fail over time causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include a coolant leak, oil leak, or a decrease in coolant level. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket, which typically costs $500 - $1,000 including labor. 
  - **Oxygen Sensor Failure:** The oxygen sensors monitor the exhaust gases and help regulate the air-fuel mixture. Over time, they can become faulty, leading to decreased engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and potential catalytic converter damage. Replacing an oxygen sensor can cost around $200 - $500 including labor. 
  - **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure:** A faulty crankshaft position sensor (CKP) can cause intermittent stalling, difficulty starting, or a lack of power. Replacing the sensor costs around $200 - $400 including labor. 

**Transmission**

- **5-Speed Automatic**
  - **Shift Solenoid Failure:** The shift solenoids control the transmission's shifting operation. A failing solenoid can cause harsh shifting, delayed shifts, or transmission slipping. Replacing the solenoid typically costs between $300 - $600 including labor.

**Suspension**
  - **Rear Suspension Bushing Wear:** The rubber bushings in the rear suspension can deteriorate over time, leading to excessive noise, vibrations, and decreased handling performance. Replacing these bushings can cost around $400 - $800 including labor. 

**Electrical**
  - **Alternator Failure:** The alternator generates electricity for the vehicle's electrical system. A failing alternator can cause dim lights, battery discharge, or electrical system malfunctions. Replacing an alternator typically costs between $500 - $1,000 including labor. 
  - **Starter Failure:** The starter motor is responsible for turning over the engine. A faulty starter can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or a complete failure. Replacing a starter costs around $300 - $600 including labor.
     - **Recall: NHTSA Campaign number 99V168000 - Starter motor malfunction**

**Exterior**
  - **Headlight Lens Fogging:** The plastic headlight lenses can become foggy or yellowed, reducing light output and visibility. Polishing the lenses can restore clarity, but replacing the lenses is a more permanent solution. Replacing headlight lenses can cost $400 - $800 including labor. 

**Interior**
  - **Climate Control Module Failure:** The climate control module regulates the temperature and airflow in the cabin. A faulty module can cause erratic temperature control, fan issues, or a complete failure of the system. Replacing the climate control module can cost $500 - $1,000 including labor. 
  - **Power Window Motor Failure:** The power window motors can fail over time, leading to difficulty or failure in operating the windows. Replacing a power window motor typically costs $200 - $400 including labor. 

**Overall Summary**

The 1999 Lexus LS400 generally exhibits good reliability, but the potential issues mentioned above can impact its performance and comfort. The severity and cost of these issues vary depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage. Regular maintenance and timely repairs can help minimize the chances of encountering these issues and ensure the vehicle's continued reliability.
