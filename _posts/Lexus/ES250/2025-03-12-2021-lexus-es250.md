Okay, here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2021 Lexus ES 250, formatted as requested.

The 2021 Lexus ES 250 is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and reputation for reliability. The ES 250 is the only trim level to come with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, coupled with an 8-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Other ES trims are available with a more powerful 3.5-liter V6 or as a hybrid. Drivers often praise the ES 250 for its smooth ride, fuel efficiency for a luxury car, and upscale interior. Some criticisms include the somewhat uninspired handling compared to sportier competitors and the infotainment system's touchpad interface.
