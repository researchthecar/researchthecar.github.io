The 2023 Lexus ES 250 is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and reputation for reliability. The ES 250 is powered by a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine producing 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options available for the 2023 ES include the ES 350, which features a 3.5-liter V6 engine, and the ES 300h, a hybrid model with a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine and electric motor. What owners generally appreciate about the ES 250 is its smooth ride quality, quiet cabin, fuel efficiency (especially in the hybrid model), and Lexus's renowned reliability. Some common criticisms include the somewhat uninspired driving dynamics, the infotainment system's touchpad interface, and the relatively small trunk space compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This may manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: There is currently no official fix. Oil consumption is monitored by Lexus service technicians to determine if it falls within acceptable ranges. Some owners have reported improved oil consumption after switching to different oil brands or weights. In extreme cases, engine replacement may be considered under warranty, although this is rare.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during low-speed acceleration or downshifting. Others have noted a hesitation or delay when accelerating from a stop.
    * Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can address this issue. In some cases, a more thorough inspection of the transmission may be necessary, and repair or replacement of components like valve bodies may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0-$200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, including the navigation, audio, and climate control interfaces, may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash entirely. This can be intermittent or occur more frequently.
    *   Solution: A software update to the infotainment system is the first step to address this issue. A hard reset of the system may also provide temporary relief. In more severe cases, replacement of the infotainment system hardware may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update), $500 - $2000+ (hardware replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Wireless Charging Pad Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent or unreliable wireless charging of smartphones. The charging pad may fail to recognize the device, or charging may be interrupted frequently.
    *   Solution: Ensuring the phone is properly positioned on the charging pad and removing any obstructions (e.g., phone case) can sometimes resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the charging pad module may need to be inspected and replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear deck. These noises can be particularly noticeable on rough roads or at highway speeds.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and applying felt tape or other sound-dampening material to the affected areas. Tightening loose trim pieces or fasteners may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic High Beam Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic high beam system may not function correctly, failing to dim the high beams when approaching oncoming traffic or vehicles ahead.
    *   Solution: Recalibration of the automatic high beam system or replacement of the sensor responsible for detecting other vehicles.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Lexus ES 250 generally enjoys a reputation for reliability. However, like any vehicle, it's not immune to issues. The most commonly reported problems include electrical glitches with the infotainment system and wireless charging pad, and occasional rattling noises in the interior. Some owners have also reported harsh shifting with the 8-speed transmission, and a few have mentioned excessive oil consumption with the 2.5L engine. While most of these issues are relatively minor and can be addressed with software updates or minor repairs, more serious problems like transmission or infotainment system failure can be costly to fix. Overall, the 2023 ES 250 appears to be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
