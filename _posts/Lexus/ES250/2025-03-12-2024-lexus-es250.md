The 2024 Lexus ES250 is an entry-level luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reputation for reliability. The ES250 is powered by a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine producing 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options available in the ES lineup include the ES350 with a 3.5-liter V6 and the ES300h with a hybrid powertrain. Owners often praise the ES250 for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and fuel efficiency, but some find the acceleration to be somewhat lackluster compared to its V6-powered sibling. Common complaints often revolve around the infotainment system's complexity and the somewhat conservative styling.

    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting, especially during low-speed acceleration and deceleration. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or hesitation when shifting between gears.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement might be necessary.
