Here's a breakdown of the common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2015 Lexus NX 300h, categorized by major components.

The 2015 Lexus NX 300h is a compact luxury hybrid SUV known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and Lexus reliability. The NX 300h features a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine paired with an electric motor, delivering a combined 194 horsepower and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). It's generally praised for its upscale interior, smooth driving experience, and good fuel economy.
