The 2024 Lexus LS 500 is a flagship luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, opulent interior, and refined driving experience. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 engine producing 416 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid version, the LS 500h, is also available, combining a 3.5-liter V6 with an electric motor. Owners often praise the LS 500 for its comfortable seats, quiet cabin, and advanced technology. However, some criticisms include the infotainment system's touchpad interface, which can be distracting to use while driving, and the car's somewhat conservative styling compared to some of its rivals. This analysis focuses on common issues reported specifically for the 2024 LS 500, categorized for clarity.

**Engine**

**3.5L Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Turbocharger Wastegate Actuator Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may exhibit reduced power, hesitation during acceleration, or unusual whistling noises from the engine bay. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) related to turbocharger boost pressure may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected turbocharger wastegate actuator or, in some cases, the entire turbocharger assembly. A software update may be available to optimize the wastegate control.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ depending on whether just the actuator can be replaced or the entire turbo needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced fuel economy, and potential difficulty starting the engine. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to fuel injector performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty injector(s) followed by replacement. Cleaning the fuel injectors may offer a temporary solution in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+ depending on the number of injectors that need to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable harshness during gear changes, particularly between lower gears (1st-3rd). The transmission may exhibit jerking or shuddering during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution:  A transmission control module (TCM) software update can often improve shift quality.  If the problem persists, a more detailed inspection of the transmission may be required, including checking fluid levels and condition. Replacement of valve body components or the entire transmission may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 for software update, $500-$1500+ for valve body repair, $5000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into Drive or Reverse and the vehicle actually moving. This can be accompanied by a slight "clunk" sound.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and refill with the correct type of fluid may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, internal transmission damage may be present, requiring more extensive repairs or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 for fluid flush, $3000+ for internal repairs, $5000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle may sit unevenly or lower than normal.  A warning light related to the air suspension system may be illuminated. The air suspension compressor may be excessively noisy or fail to activate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor. Check for leaks in the air lines and struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+ depending on the shop labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Malfunction (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Stiff or unusually harsh ride, regardless of the selected drive mode.  A warning light may be illuminated.
    *   Solution:  Diagnosis to identify the faulty AVS component (shock absorber, sensor, or control module). Replacement of the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ depending on the failed component.
    *   Recalls: None Found
