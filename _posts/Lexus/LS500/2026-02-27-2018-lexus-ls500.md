# 2018 Lexus LS500

### Overview
The 2018 Lexus LS500 represents the fifth generation of Lexus's flagship sedan, introducing a completely redesigned platform and powertrain. This model year marked a significant shift with the adoption of a twin-turbocharged V6 engine and a 10-speed automatic transmission as standard across all trims. The LS500 is engineered for luxury, performance, and, as is typical of Lexus, a high degree of reliability. While the new powertrain and platform were generally well-received, early production models can sometimes exhibit unique issues as kinks are worked out. This analysis focuses on documented technical reliability concerns beyond routine maintenance, aiming to provide a clear picture of potential owner experiences.

However, potential owners should be aware of isolated reports concerning the adaptive air suspension, which can develop leaks or compressor problems, and some electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system's responsiveness and occasional 12V battery drain issues. These are not universal but represent the most commonly cited technical concerns beyond standard maintenance. Overall, the LS500 remains a robust luxury sedan, but vigilance regarding suspension and electrical systems is advised.
