The 2021 Lexus LS500 represents the pinnacle of Lexus luxury, offering a smooth ride, a meticulously crafted interior, and a host of advanced technologies. However, even with Lexus's reputation for reliability, some owners have reported issues. The LS500 is powered by a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 engine producing 416 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. While many appreciate the LS500 for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and luxurious features, some criticisms include the somewhat controversial exterior styling, infotainment system complexity, and the lack of a V8 engine option that was a hallmark of previous LS models.
