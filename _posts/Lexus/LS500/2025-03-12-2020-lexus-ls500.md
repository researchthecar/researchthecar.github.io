The 2020 Lexus LS500 is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, opulent interior, and advanced technology. Available in rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive configurations, it boasts a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 engine producing 416 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque. The engine is mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Some of the highlights of the LS500 are its quiet cabin, smooth ride, and user-friendly infotainment system (despite some criticisms, as mentioned below). Common complaints center around the Remote Touch interface, which some find clunky and distracting, as well as the somewhat uninspired engine sound for a luxury vehicle in this class.
