The 2011 Lexus IS250 is a luxury compact sedan known for its comfortable ride, refined interior, and Lexus reliability. It comes standard with a 2.5L V6 engine producing 204 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the IS250 for its nimble handling and upscale features, while others find its acceleration to be underwhelming and the rear seats cramped. A more powerful IS350 with a 3.5L V6 (306 hp) was also available, along with all-wheel drive options on both models.

**Engine**

**2.5L V6 (4GR-FSE)**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines, like the 2.5L V6 in the IS250, can experience carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel sprayed behind the valves to clean them. This can lead to rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: A professional carbon cleaning service is required to remove the buildup. This may involve walnut blasting or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Recall**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2006-2011 IS250 models were affected by a recall for potentially defective valve springs. This could lead to engine misfires, unusual engine noise, or even engine failure in extreme cases.
    *   Solution: Replacement of all engine valve springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Recall work performed free of charge by Lexus dealerships.
    *   Recalls: Recall Number SSC 90L
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may develop over time from valve cover gaskets or other engine seals. These leaks can result in a burning oil smell, visible oil drips, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the location of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A960E 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a shuddering or vibrating sensation, especially at lower speeds (around 40 mph) under light acceleration. This is often attributed to wear in the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (torque converter only), $3000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, some owners have reported experiencing delayed or harsh shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be caused by worn valve body components or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush, valve body replacement, or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (fluid flush), $800 - $1500 (valve body), $3000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn lower control arm bushings can cause clunking noises when going over bumps, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lower control arm bushings or the entire lower control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side (depending on whether just the bushings or the entire control arm is replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may experience flickering, dimming, or complete failure. This can be due to a faulty screen, connections, or the navigation unit itself.
    * Solution: Replacement of the screen or navigation unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete loss of Bluetooth connectivity. Difficulty pairing devices or maintaining a stable connection.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture accumulating inside the headlight housings. This can reduce headlight effectiveness and potentially damage the bulbs or electrical components.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per headlight
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Lexus IS250 is a generally reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues. The most significant concern is carbon buildup in the engine, which can lead to performance problems and costly repairs. Other issues, such as torque converter shudder, suspension wear, and electrical problems, are less frequent but should be considered when evaluating a used IS250. Overall, the IS250 offers a good balance of luxury and reliability, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
