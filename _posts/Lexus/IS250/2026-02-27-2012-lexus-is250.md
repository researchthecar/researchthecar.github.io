### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Lexus IS250 is a highly reliable vehicle with a strong track record. The primary documented concern relates to potential carbon buildup on the intake valves of the 2.5L V6 engine, a common issue for direct-injection engines of this era, which can affect performance if left unaddressed. Minor oil leaks from valve cover gaskets are also occasionally reported. However, the transmission, suspension, electrical systems, and interior/exterior components are generally very durable and do not present widespread reliability concerns. Regular maintenance is key, but significant, unexpected repairs are uncommon for this model, making it a solid choice for those seeking dependable luxury transportation.
