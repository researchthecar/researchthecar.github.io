The 2009 Lexus IS250 is a compact luxury sedan known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and sleek styling. The base model comes equipped with a 2.5-liter V6 engine producing 204 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Some people appreciate the Lexus's smooth ride and luxurious interior, while others find the engine underpowered compared to competitors. A more powerful 3.5-liter V6, the 2GR-FSE, producing 306 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque was available in the IS350. The IS250 came standard with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often complain about the limited rear seat space and the infotainment system's dated interface.

**Engine**

**2.5L 4GR-FSE V6**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over them to keep them clean. This can cause rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and a loss of power. Symptoms worsen over time.
    *   Solution: Walnut blasting the intake valves or using chemical cleaners to remove carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Cover Oil Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the timing cover gasket, usually seen as oil stains on the engine block or oil drips under the car. Can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A960E 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. The valve body controls the flow of transmission fluid, and issues can disrupt proper gear engagement.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can also cause vibrations or uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the lower control arm bushings or the entire lower control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may freeze, glitch, or fail to power on. This is typically due to a failure of the navigation system's ECU.
    *   Solution: Replacing the navigation system ECU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

**Summary**

The 2009 Lexus IS250 has some common issues, including carbon buildup on the engine valves, timing cover leaks, valve body issues, and suspension wear. While some issues, like carbon buildup, are relatively common in direct injection engines, others, like valve body issues, can be more expensive to repair. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially significant mechanical problems, so it's important to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
