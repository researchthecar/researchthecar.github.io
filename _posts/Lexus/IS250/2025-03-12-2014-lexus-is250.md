**Summary**

The 2014 Lexus IS250 is generally reliable, but owners should be aware of the potential for carbon buildup, oil leaks, and cooling system issues on the 2.5L V6 engine. Harsh shifting in the transmission can also occur. Suspension components, particularly control arm bushings, are susceptible to wear. Electrical issues like infotainment problems and battery drain, along with exterior headlight condensation and interior dashboard cracking, are also potential areas of concern. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more costly repairs, but overall, the IS250's problems are typically less severe and expensive compared to some other luxury cars in its class.
