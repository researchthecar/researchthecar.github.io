The 2006 Lexus IS250 marked the beginning of the second generation for the IS line. Available with either a 2.5L V6 (204 horsepower, 185 lb-ft of torque) or a 3.5L V6 (306 horsepower, 277 lb-ft of torque), the IS250 came with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the IS350 came with only a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the IS250 for its comfortable ride, sporty handling, luxurious interior, and reliability. Criticisms often include the relatively underpowered engine of the IS250, the small rear seats, and the lack of storage space.

**Engine**

**2.5L V6 (4GR-FSE)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 4GR-FSE are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over them to clean them. This buildup restricts airflow, leading to rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the intake valves through methods like walnut blasting or chemical cleaning. Installing an oil catch can can help prevent further buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ depending on the cleaning method and shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks commonly develop from the valve cover gaskets or the front timing cover. Signs include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets or resealing the front timing cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gaskets $200-$500. Front timing cover $800-$1500.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (A960E)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration, typically between 30-45 mph. This is often caused by deterioration of the torque converter fluid or wear within the torque converter itself.
    *   Solution: Performing a complete transmission fluid flush using the correct fluid type (Toyota WS). If the shudder persists, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission fluid flush $200-$400. Torque converter replacement $800-$1,500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Steering may feel loose or vague. The lower control arm bushings are prone to cracking and deteriorating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the lower control arms or just the bushings if possible. After replacement, an alignment is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Lower control arm replacement $400-$800 per side. Bushing replacement $200-$500 per side, plus alignment.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may flicker, dim, or completely fail. This can be caused by a faulty LCD screen or a problem with the navigation system module.
    *   Solution: Replacing the LCD screen or the entire navigation system module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: LCD screen replacement $300-$600. Navigation system module replacement $800-$1,500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes related to oxygen sensors. Poor fuel economy and/or rough engine running may also be present. Oxygen sensors can fail due to age and exposure to exhaust gases.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400 per sensor, depending on location (upstream vs. downstream).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks developing in the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire dashboard. This is very labor-intensive and expensive. Some owners opt for aftermarket dashboard covers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dashboard replacement $1,500-$3,000+. Dashboard cover $50-$200.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Certain interior trim pieces, such as the door handles or center console, becoming sticky or tacky to the touch. This is due to the breakdown of the coating used on these parts.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the affected parts with a degreaser and potentially reapplying a new coating or replacing the parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Cleaning and recoating $100-$300. Parts replacement varies.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **HID Headlight Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or both HID headlights failing to illuminate or flickering. This can be caused by a faulty HID bulb, ballast, or igniter.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty HID bulb, ballast, or igniter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: HID bulb replacement $100-$300 per bulb. Ballast or igniter replacement $200-$500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Lexus IS250, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. The carbon buildup issue on the 2.5L engine is a prevalent concern that can lead to performance problems and costly repairs. Other notable issues include torque converter shudder, suspension bushing wear, and electrical issues. The interior dashboard cracking and sticky trim are cosmetic concerns that can detract from the ownership experience. Overall, addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand for engine work or complete dashboard replacement. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify any potential problems early on.
