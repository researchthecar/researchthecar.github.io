However, it does have some potential issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

**2.5-liter V6**

* **Oil consumption:** Excessive oil consumption can occur due to worn piston rings or valve guide seals. Symptoms include a burning oil smell, blue smoke from the exhaust, and low oil levels on the dipstick. The solution involves replacing the affected parts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
* **Water pump failure:** The water pump can fail prematurely, leading to coolant leaks and engine overheating. Symptoms include a coolant leak, high coolant temperature gauge readings, and a whining noise from the water pump. The solution is to replace the water pump. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to skip or break. This can result in catastrophic engine damage.

**Six-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission shifting issues:** The transmission may experience shifting problems, such as hesitation, slipping, or delayed engagement. These issues can be caused by worn solenoids, faulty sensors, or transmission fluid leaks. Symptoms include rough shifting, difficulty shifting gears, and a check engine light. The solution is to diagnose and repair the affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,000+
