The 2024 Lexus LS 500h is a luxury hybrid sedan known for its refined ride, opulent interior, and advanced technology. It combines a 3.5-liter V6 engine with an electric motor, producing a combined 354 horsepower and delivering smooth, near-silent acceleration. A 10-speed automatic transmission works in conjunction with the hybrid system. There is also a non-hybrid LS 500 that uses a 3.4-liter twin-turbo V6. Common praises for the LS 500h include its fuel efficiency for its class, comfortable seating, and quiet cabin. Criticisms often focus on the infotainment system's complexity and the somewhat detached driving experience compared to sportier rivals.
