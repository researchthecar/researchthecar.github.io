The 2022 Lexus LS500h is a full-size luxury hybrid sedan, representing Lexus's commitment to combining refined luxury with fuel efficiency. In addition to the hybrid powertrain, the LS500 is also available with a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 engine producing 416 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The LS500h, however, features a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, delivering a combined system output of 354 horsepower, routed through a unique Lexus multi-stage hybrid transmission. Owners often praise the LS500h for its exceptionally comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and luxurious interior appointments. Criticisms tend to focus on the infotainment system's user interface and, for some, the somewhat understated exterior styling compared to more aggressively designed competitors.

**Electric Motor**

**3.5L V6 Hybrid Electric Motor**

* **Hybrid System Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The hybrid system warning light illuminates, and the vehicle may experience reduced power, hesitation during acceleration, or complete loss of hybrid function. Diagnostic codes might point to issues with the hybrid battery pack, inverter, or motor generator.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair by a certified Lexus technician are required. This may involve replacing faulty sensors, repairing wiring harnesses, or, in more severe cases, replacing the hybrid battery pack, inverter, or motor generator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $8,000+ (depending on the component needing replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system may fail to maintain proper ride height, leading to a sagging or uneven stance. The "air suspension" warning light may illuminate. Possible causes include leaks in the air struts, a failing air compressor, or a faulty height sensor.
    * Solution: Locate and repair any air leaks in the struts or lines. Replace the air compressor if it's not functioning correctly. Recalibrate or replace faulty height sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the component needing replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (including navigation, audio, and climate controls) may experience freezing, slow response times, or intermittent malfunctions. Apple CarPlay or Android Auto connectivity issues may also occur.
    * Solution: Try a system reset (consult the owner's manual). Check for and install any available software updates. In some cases, replacement of the head unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (head unit replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring, etc.)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors may give false alarms or fail to detect obstacles. The blind spot monitoring system may not function correctly. Other sensors related to safety systems (lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control) may also experience malfunctions.
    * Solution: Check sensor surfaces for dirt or obstructions. Diagnostic testing can pinpoint the faulty sensor(s), which should then be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on location and complexity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may not open or close smoothly, gets stuck, or makes excessive noise during operation. Water leaks can also occur.
    * Solution: Clean and lubricate the sunroof tracks and seals. Check the sunroof motor and mechanism for damage. If necessary, replace the sunroof motor or the entire sunroof assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (lubrication) - $1,500+ (assembly replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Automatic Trunk/Hatch Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The automatic trunk/hatch may fail to open or close properly, or may stop midway during operation. The motor may make unusual noises.
    * Solution: Check the trunk struts and hinges for damage. Inspect the trunk motor and wiring for faults. Replace the motor or struts as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Lexus LS500h generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but like any vehicle, it can experience issues. The most commonly reported problems relate to the hybrid system, electrical components (particularly the infotainment system), and air suspension. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, ranging from minor sensor replacements to more extensive work on the hybrid system or suspension. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing issues and should also check for any applicable Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) related to these common complaints.
