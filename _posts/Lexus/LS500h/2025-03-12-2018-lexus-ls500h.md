The 2018 Lexus LS500h is a luxury hybrid sedan that blends comfort, technology, and fuel efficiency. It features a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with two electric motors, producing a combined 354 horsepower. The LS500h uses a unique multi-stage hybrid system that incorporates a four-speed automatic transmission along with the continuously variable transmission (CVT) to simulate a 10-speed automatic. Other LS500 models are available with a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 producing 416 horsepower paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the LS500h for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and luxurious interior. Common dislikes include the infotainment system's trackpad interface and some driver-assistance features being overly sensitive.

**Electric Motor**

**3.5L V6 Hybrid Engine with Electric Motor**

* **Hybrid System Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The hybrid system may display a warning light or message on the dashboard. The vehicle may exhibit reduced power, poor fuel economy, or difficulty starting/running.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the hybrid system using a specialized scanner to pinpoint the faulty component. This could involve replacing the hybrid battery pack, inverter, or motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ depending on the component replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Multi-Stage Hybrid Transmission (Simulated 10-Speed)**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough or jerky shifts, especially during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. This issue often appears during the transition between electric and gasoline power.
    * Solution: Software update or recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, replacement of the transmission may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 for software update; $5,000-$7,000+ for transmission replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip, causing the engine RPM to increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This can be more noticeable under heavy acceleration.
    * Solution: Thorough inspection of the transmission for internal damage. Replacement of the transmission fluid and filter may resolve the issue in mild cases. More severe cases will require transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 for fluid and filter; $5,000-$7,000+ for transmission replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may sag on one or more corners, ride height may be uneven, or the suspension compressor may run constantly. A warning light may appear on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the air suspension system to identify the faulty component. This could include replacing the air struts, compressor, or ride height sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per air strut; $800-$1,500+ for compressor replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    * Solution: Software update of the infotainment system. In some cases, replacement of the head unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update is available); $1,500 - $3,000+ for head unit replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery may drain prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can result in difficulty starting the engine or hybrid system.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the electrical system to identify any parasitic draws. This could involve replacing a faulty module or component that is draining power.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause of the drain.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Navigation System Errors**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation system may display inaccurate location information or fail to find destinations.
    * Solution: Update the navigation system software and maps. If the problem persists, the GPS antenna or receiver may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update is available); $300 - $800+ for antenna or receiver replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may fail to open or close properly, or it may make excessive noise during operation.
    * Solution: Inspect the sunroof tracks and lubricate them. If the motor or other components are faulty, they may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for lubrication and minor repairs; $500 - $1,500+ for motor or component replacement.

**Summary**

The 2018 Lexus LS500h is generally a reliable luxury sedan, but owners have reported issues across various components. The most concerning issues relate to the hybrid system and transmission, which can be expensive to repair. Electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and potential battery drain are also areas to watch. Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension (if equipped), can also lead to significant repair costs. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars in some cases.
