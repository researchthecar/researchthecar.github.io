**Engine**

**3.5L Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, reduced power, check engine light. This issue seems to affect a small percentage of the early production models.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger(s). Some owners have reported that Lexus replaced both turbos as a precautionary measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak From Turbo Lines**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak near the turbochargers, white smoke from the exhaust, low coolant level.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the coolant lines associated with the turbocharger cooling system. Improved redesigned lines are used as replacements.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerky Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough shifts between gears, especially at lower speeds. Some owners describe a "clunking" sensation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update of the transmission control module (TCM) resolves the issue. If the problem persists, a transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: $150-$300; Transmission Replacement: $7,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between pressing the accelerator and the vehicle moving, particularly when starting from a stop.
    *   Solution: Similar to the harsh shifting issue, a TCM software update is the first step. If unsuccessful, a more in-depth transmission diagnosis is required, potentially leading to valve body replacement or transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: $150-$300; Valve Body Replacement: $2,000 - $4,000+; Transmission Replacement: $7,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning light on the dashboard, uneven ride, clunking noises from the suspension. This can be caused by a faulty sensor or actuator within the AVS system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty AVS component (sensor or actuator) and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per component replaced
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting unevenly, compressor running excessively, "Suspension Low" warning light. This is more common in areas with temperature extremes.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the air leak. This could involve replacing an air strut, air line, or the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air Strut Replacement: $1,500 - $3,000+ per strut; Compressor Replacement: $1,000 - $2,500+; Air Line Repair: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or randomly reboots.
    *   Solution: A software update is usually the first step. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: $0 - $200 (dealer dependent); Infotainment Unit Replacement: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Parking Sensor Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors not working, false alarms, error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Check for obstructions on the sensors. If clear, the faulty sensor needs to be identified and replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Running Board Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Running boards not deploying or retracting properly, making unusual noises, or getting stuck.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the hinges and moving parts may resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, the running board motor or the entire assembly may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Lubrication/Minor Repair: $100 - $300; Motor Replacement: $500 - $1,500+; Entire Assembly Replacement: $2,000 - $4,000+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof not opening or closing smoothly, getting stuck, making excessive noise, or leaking.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the tracks may resolve minor issues. For more complex problems, the sunroof motor or the entire assembly may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Lubrication/Minor Repair: $100 - $300; Motor Replacement: $500 - $1,200+; Sunroof Assembly Replacement: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Lexus LX600, while generally reliable, can experience issues ranging from minor software glitches to more significant mechanical problems. The most concerning issues appear to be related to the turbochargers, transmission, and potentially the adaptive suspension. While many reported issues seem to resolve with simple software updates, owners should be aware of the potential for costly repairs, particularly concerning turbocharger or transmission replacements.
