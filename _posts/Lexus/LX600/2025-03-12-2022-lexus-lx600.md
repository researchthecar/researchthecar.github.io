The 2022 Lexus LX600 marks a significant redesign for the flagship SUV, offering a blend of luxury, off-road capability, and modern technology. It is powered by a 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 409 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque, replacing the previous generation's V8. This engine is paired exclusively with a 10-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the LX600's opulent interior, smooth ride (especially with the available air suspension), and impressive off-road prowess. However, some criticisms include the complex infotainment system, the lack of a hybrid option, and the high price point.
