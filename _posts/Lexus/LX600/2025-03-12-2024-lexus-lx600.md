The 2024 Lexus LX600 is a full-size luxury SUV known for its opulent interior, off-road capabilities, and refined driving experience. It is powered by a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 engine producing 409 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often praise its comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and high-end features, but some have noted its large size can be cumbersome in urban environments. The infotainment system has also been a point of contention for some users.
