The 2024 Lexus NX350 is a luxury compact SUV known for its comfortable ride, stylish interior, and user-friendly technology. The NX350 comes standard with a 2.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 275 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other powertrain options for the 2024 NX include the NX250 with a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated inline-4, the NX350h hybrid with a 2.5-liter inline-4 and electric motors, and the NX450h+ plug-in hybrid with a similar hybrid setup but with a larger battery pack for extended electric range. Owners generally praise the NX for its luxurious features, smooth ride, and Lexus's reputation for reliability. Some common dislikes include the sometimes-frustrating infotainment system, the smaller cargo area compared to some competitors, and the somewhat uninspired driving dynamics compared to sportier rivals.
