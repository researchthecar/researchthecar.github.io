The 2022 Lexus NX350 is a compact luxury SUV that was completely redesigned for the 2022 model year. The NX350 is equipped with a 2.4L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 275 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. It's paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other powertrain options include the NX250 with a naturally aspirated 2.5L inline-4, the NX350h hybrid with a 2.5L inline-4 and electric motors, and the NX450h+ plug-in hybrid. Many owners appreciate the NX350's comfortable ride, stylish interior, and updated technology, especially the new infotainment system. Some common complaints include the touch-sensitive controls being distracting, the smaller cargo area compared to competitors, and the somewhat uninspired driving dynamics, although the NX350 is meant to be a comfortable daily driver and not a sporty SUV.
