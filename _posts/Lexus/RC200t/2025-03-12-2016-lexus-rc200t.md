The 2016 Lexus RC200t is a stylish luxury coupe that offered a blend of comfort, performance, and Lexus reliability. While known for its sleek design and comfortable ride, it's important to be aware of potential issues that owners have reported. The RC200t is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options for the 2016 RC included the RC 300 with a 3.5-liter V6 (255 hp) and the RC 350 with a more powerful version of the 3.5-liter V6 (306 hp). Owners generally appreciate the RC200t's comfortable ride and luxurious interior, while some find the engine performance adequate but not particularly sporty, and the rear seats somewhat cramped.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (2AR-FTS)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 2AR-FTS can experience carbon buildup on the intake valves due to the lack of fuel washing over them. This can lead to rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) or chemical induction cleaning. Installation of an oil catch can can help reduce the amount of oil vapor recirculated into the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ (depending on the method used and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (AA80E)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or when downshifting has also been noted. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn solenoids, or software issues.
    *   Solution: Check and top off transmission fluid level. If the fluid is dirty or contaminated, perform a transmission fluid flush. A software update from the dealer may be available to address shifting issues. In some cases, replacing the solenoids may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (for fluid check/flush), $500 - $1500+ (for solenoid replacement), $100+ (for software update)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some users have reported freezing, slow response times, or difficulty updating the navigation system.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealer are the most common fix. In some cases, replacement of the navigation unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100+ (for software update), $500 - $2000+ (for unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **DRL (Daytime Running Light) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the LED daytime running lights. This typically manifests as one or more LEDs going out or flickering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire headlight assembly is often required, as the DRL LEDs are typically integrated into the unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (per headlight assembly)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracking on the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard. Some owners have had success with aftermarket dashboard covers or repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+ (for dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Lexus RC200t, while generally reliable, has some potential issues to be aware of. Carbon buildup on the intake valves is a common concern with direct-injection engines and requires periodic maintenance. Potential transmission issues, like harsh shifting, should be addressed promptly. Some electrical and interior issues, such as navigation problems and dashboard cracking, can also occur, however exterior DRL issues are also common, and can be costly. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues can vary, but being aware of them can help potential buyers make informed decisions and budget for potential repairs.
