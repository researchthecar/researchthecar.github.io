The 2017 Lexus RC200t is a luxury sports coupe known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and refined interior. The RC200t is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The other engine options available in the RC line for that year include the RC300 with a 3.5-liter V6 and the RC350 with a more powerful version of the 3.5-liter V6. Owners generally appreciate the RC200t's sleek looks, smooth ride, and luxurious features. Common complaints include the relatively small back seat and trunk space, as well as the infotainment system's somewhat cumbersome interface.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (2AR-FTS)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 2AR-FTS are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over the valves to clean them. This can lead to rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: A walnut blasting service to remove carbon deposits from the intake valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various seals and gaskets on the engine, such as the valve cover gasket, timing chain cover gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected seals or gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (AA81E)**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifting, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. This can be caused by issues with the transmission control module (TCM) or internal components.
    * Solution: Recalibrating the TCM or replacing faulty components within the transmission. A fluid flush and fill with the correct fluid may sometimes help with minor shifting issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush and fill) - $200+ (TCM) - $2000+ (Transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Lexus infotainment system, particularly with the touchpad interface, can be frustrating to use. Some owners have reported freezing, slow response times, and difficulty navigating the menus.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1000+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. Replacing the battery may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the cause of the drain and the cost of a new battery.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In some vehicles, the dashboard material may be susceptible to cracking, especially in hot climates.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Lexus RC200t generally offers a reliable and enjoyable ownership experience. The most commonly reported issues relate to carbon buildup, infotainment system glitches, and the potential for oil leaks.
