**Summary**

The 2004 Lexus GX470 is generally considered a reliable vehicle, but age-related issues are common. The most concerning issues involve the suspension (AHC system), rust on the frame and the engine. Suspension and frame issues can be expensive to repair and may require specialized expertise. Valve cover gasket and exhaust manifold leaks are common and can be costly to fix due to labor. Interior and electrical issues such as cracked dashboards and power window failures, while not as critical to vehicle operation, can affect the overall ownership experience. Prospective buyers should have a thorough inspection performed by a qualified mechanic, paying close attention to the suspension system, frame rust, and engine condition.
