Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2008 Lexus GX 470, formatted for your website and focusing on accuracy and specific details:

The 2008 Lexus GX 470 is a body-on-frame SUV known for its off-road capability, reliability, and luxurious features. It was only available with a single engine option: a 4.7L V8 engine producing around 263 horsepower and 323 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its comfortable ride, robust build quality, and Toyota reliability. Common dislikes often include its relatively poor fuel economy and somewhat dated styling.

**Engine**

**4.7L 2UZ-FE V8**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common as the valve cover gaskets age and harden. Look for oil around the valve covers and potential burning oil smells.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Secondary Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The secondary air injection system helps reduce emissions during cold starts. The pump can fail, leading to a check engine light and potential rough running during startup. The pump itself is often the culprit.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the secondary air injection pump. Bypassing the system is also possible but can affect emissions compliance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Leaks (Water Pump, Radiator)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: As the GX470 ages, cooling system components can become brittle. Watch for leaks around the water pump, radiator, and hoses. Overheating can occur if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking component(s). A full cooling system service might be advisable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A750F 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: As the transmission ages, owners sometimes report delayed or harsh shifting, particularly between gears. This can be due to wear in the valve body or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes resolve minor issues. More severe cases might require valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush); $800 - $3000+ (valve body/rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension (RAS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The GX470's rear air suspension can develop leaks in the air springs or the compressor can fail. This leads to the rear of the vehicle sagging or failing to maintain proper ride height.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air springs or the air suspension compressor. Some owners opt to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (air springs/compressor); $500 - $1000+ (coil spring conversion)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **X-REAS (Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System) Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The X-REAS system, which links shocks diagonally to reduce body roll, is prone to leaks. If leaks are present, the ride quality and handling will suffer and the system will need repair
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking X-REAS shock absorber and any associated parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen can fail or develop dead pixels over time. This affects navigation, audio controls, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the navigation screen or repair of the unit. Aftermarket head units are also a common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mark Levinson Amplifier Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mark Levinson sound system's amplifier can fail, resulting in loss of audio.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the amplifier.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While not as pervasive as some other vehicles, rust can develop on the GX470's frame, especially in areas with heavy salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust prevention and treatment measures. Welding repair or frame replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard material is prone to cracking, especially in hot climates and on vehicles left outside.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Lexus GX470 is a generally reliable vehicle, but as with any older SUV, it's prone to certain age-related issues. The most common problems involve the engine (valve cover leaks, secondary air injection pump), suspension (air suspension issues), and electrical components (navigation screen). Frame rust is also a concern, particularly in areas with road salt. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive (valve cover gaskets), others like air suspension repairs or electrical replacements can be costly. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and factor in potential repair costs. Overall, the GX470 still remains a vehicle worth considering based on the fact that the severity and cost of the issues are average to low.
