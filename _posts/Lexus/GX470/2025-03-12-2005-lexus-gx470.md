The 2005 Lexus GX470 is a body-on-frame SUV known for its off-road capability, luxurious features, and Toyota reliability. It came with only one engine and transmission option: the 4.7L 2UZ-FE V8 engine producing 270 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the GX470's comfortable ride, strong V8 power, and Toyota's reliability track record. Common dislikes include its relatively poor fuel economy, dated interior design (for some), and body roll when cornering.

**Summary**

The 2005 Lexus GX470 is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues related to the engine (valve cover gaskets, exhaust manifolds, secondary air injection), transmission (shift solenoids, torque converter), and suspension (X-REAS, air suspension). Frame rust is a serious concern, especially in northern states. Electrical issues with the navigation screen and power windows are also not uncommon. The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major repairs like suspension overhauls or frame work. Due diligence, including a thorough inspection by a qualified mechanic, is recommended before purchasing a used 2005 GX470.
