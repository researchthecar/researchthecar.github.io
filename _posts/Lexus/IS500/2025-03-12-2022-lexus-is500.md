The 2022 Lexus IS 500 is a performance-oriented version of the IS sedan, powered by a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine that produces 472 horsepower and 395 lb-ft of torque. It is paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Many appreciate the IS 500 for its powerful engine, engaging driving dynamics, and classic Lexus refinement. Common criticisms include its dated infotainment system and smaller rear seat compared to some competitors. The other trim levels of the 2022 Lexus IS are the IS 300 and IS 350 with engine options being a 2.0L inline-4 or a 3.5L V6, respectively, paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission for the IS300 RWD, an 8-speed automatic transmission for the IS350 RWD, and both paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission for AWD models.

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption. The rate can vary but may manifest as needing to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings or the need to regularly top off the oil.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address any identified consumption issues with a Lexus dealer to determine the cause. There is no widespread known 'fix' at this time, as consumption can depend on driving style. Possible resolutions could include a faulty PCV valve, or in severe cases, piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis at a dealer is usually around $100-$200. PCV valve replacement is typically under $300. Piston ring replacement can range from $3,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the repair and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of one or more fuel injectors failing, leading to rough idling, misfires, and potential loss of power. Check engine light will likely illuminate.

**Summary**

The 2022 Lexus IS 500, while generally reliable, does have some reported issues. The most concerning issues relate to potential oil consumption and fuel injector failures on the 5.0L V8 engine which could lead to significant repair costs. Harsh shifting from the transmission, electrical issues with the infotainment system, and subpar factory paint quality are more minor but still noteworthy. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase and ensure all software updates have been performed.
