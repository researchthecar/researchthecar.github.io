The 2023 Lexus IS500 is a performance-oriented compact luxury sedan that boasts a powerful 5.0-liter V8 engine. This engine delivers 472 horsepower and 395 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the IS lineup include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 and a 3.5-liter V6, paired with either an 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed automatic transmission depending on the engine and trim level.
