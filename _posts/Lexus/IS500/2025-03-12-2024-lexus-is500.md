The 2024 Lexus IS500 is a performance-oriented sedan that distinguishes itself with a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine. Other IS models are available with a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4, or a 3.5-liter V6. The IS500's V8 produces 472 horsepower and 395 lb-ft of torque and is paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the IS500 for its engaging driving experience, potent engine, and relatively understated styling. However, some criticisms include the outdated infotainment system, limited rear seat space, and fuel economy expected from a V8.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add a quart of oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and potentially switching to a different oil viscosity. In severe cases, a dealer investigation is necessary, which may involve oil consumption tests and potentially internal engine repairs or component replacement if an underlying issue is identified.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for monitoring and topping off) to $1000+ (for dealer diagnostics and repairs if an underlying mechanical issue is found).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased performance and fuel economy, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted occasional rough or delayed shifts, particularly during low-speed acceleration or downshifts. The transmission might hesitate before engaging a gear, leading to a jerky driving experience.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and software update of the transmission control module (TCM) can often resolve these issues. In more severe cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (for fluid flush and software update) to $1500+ (for valve body replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or squeaking sounds coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspection of rear suspension components, specifically the bushings, joints, and stabilizer bar links. Lubricating or replacing worn bushings or links can eliminate the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or randomly reboots. This can disrupt navigation, audio playback, and other features.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or updating the infotainment software to the latest version. In some cases, a dealer visit may be required to diagnose and replace faulty hardware components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates and resets) to $500+ (for hardware replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing devices, dropped connections, or poor audio quality during Bluetooth calls or music streaming.
    *   Solution: Deleting and re-pairing the device, updating the infotainment software, or checking for compatibility issues with the device. In some cases, a dealer visit may be required to diagnose and replace the Bluetooth module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for re-pairing and software updates) to $300+ (for Bluetooth module replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic High Beam Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic high beam system may not function correctly, failing to activate or deactivate in appropriate situations. This can be due to sensor obstruction or software issues.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the windshield sensor, recalibrating the system, or updating the software. In some cases, the sensor itself may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for cleaning) to $300+ (for sensor replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or creaking noises emanating from the sunroof/moonroof area, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Inspecting the sunroof/moonroof seals, tracks, and components for looseness or debris. Lubricating the tracks and adjusting the seals can often resolve the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

While the 2024 Lexus IS500 is generally considered a reliable vehicle, some owners have reported issues ranging from minor annoyances to more significant mechanical concerns. The most common issues include excessive oil consumption with the 5.0L V8 engine, rough shifting from the 8-speed automatic transmission, and electrical glitches with the infotainment system. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some being easily resolved through software updates or minor adjustments, while others may require more extensive repairs and higher expenses. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase.
