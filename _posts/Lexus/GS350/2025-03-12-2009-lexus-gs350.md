The 2009 Lexus GS350 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, refined interior, and reliability. The primary engine option is a 3.5L V6 producing 303 horsepower and 274 lb-ft of torque. A 4.6L V8 engine producing 342 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque was available in the GS460, and a hybrid 3.5L V6 was available in the GS450h. The GS350 uses a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car's smooth power delivery and comfortable seats, but some dislike the somewhat dated technology and smaller rear seat compared to competitors. Common complaints involve navigation system issues and some electrical gremlins.

**Summary:**

The 2009 Lexus GS350 is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues with valve cover oil leaks and VVT-i system issues on the engine side, as well as possible torque converter or shifting issues with the transmission. Electrical problems, particularly those affecting the navigation system, are also common. Suspension component wear, such as control arm bushings and shocks, can contribute to ride quality issues over time. Dashboard cracking is a known problem that affects the vehicle's aesthetics. The severity of these issues varies, with some being relatively inexpensive to fix (e.g., fluid changes) while others can be more costly (e.g., transmission rebuild or navigation system replacement). Overall, careful inspection and preventative maintenance can help minimize the impact of these potential problems.
