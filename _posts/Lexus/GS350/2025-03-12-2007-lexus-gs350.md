**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (2GR-FSE)**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 2GR-FSE can be prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, leading to rough idling, decreased fuel economy, misfires, and a loss of power.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the intake valves via walnut blasting or chemical cleaning is a common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or delayed shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can sometimes be attributed to worn transmission fluid, but in other cases, it may indicate a problem with the valve body or solenoids.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush may help. In more severe cases, replacing the valve body or individual solenoids may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $1500+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**
