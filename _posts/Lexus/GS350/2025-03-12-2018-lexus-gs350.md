The 2018 Lexus GS 350 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and refined interior. It's generally praised for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some owners find the infotainment system's touchpad interface less intuitive compared to touchscreen systems, and the rear seat legroom can be a bit tight for taller passengers. The GS 350 comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While the GS 350 is the most common model, the GS also has other models that feature different engines and transmissions.
