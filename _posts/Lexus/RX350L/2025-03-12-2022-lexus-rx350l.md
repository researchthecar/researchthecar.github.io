The 2022 Lexus RX350L is a luxury three-row SUV known for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and reputation for reliability. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While appreciated for its smooth driving experience, quiet cabin, and standard safety features, the RX350L is sometimes criticized for its limited third-row space, less-than-sporty handling, and infotainment system interface. Common complaints often revolve around the infotainment system's complexity and lack of intuitiveness, as well as the somewhat cramped nature of the third-row seats, making it better suited for children or shorter adults.
