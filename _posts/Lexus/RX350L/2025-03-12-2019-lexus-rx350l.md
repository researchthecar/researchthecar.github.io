The 2019 Lexus RX 350L is a luxury crossover SUV offering a comfortable ride, a spacious interior (especially with the L's third row), and Lexus's reputation for reliability. It's powered by a 3.5L V6 engine, producing 290 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and luxurious appointments, some owners dislike the somewhat cramped third-row seating in the RX 350L and the infotainment system's usability. Some owners also report that the fuel economy is lower than advertised.

**Summary**

The 2019 Lexus RX 350L generally exhibits good reliability, consistent with the Lexus brand. The most commonly reported issues involve the engine (oil leaks, water pump), transmission (harsh shifting), and electrical systems (infotainment, battery drain). While some issues, like sunroof rattles or A/C problems, can be relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others, like engine resealing or transmission repairs, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and ensure that any used RX 350L has been properly maintained and inspected.
