The 2021 Lexus RX350L is a luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reputation for reliability. It offers a smooth and quiet driving experience. However, some owners find the handling less sporty than some competitors, and the infotainment system can be cumbersome to use. The 2021 RX350L comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While the RX is available as a hybrid (RX450hL), this request focuses on the non-hybrid RX350L.

*   **Engine Knocking/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine knocking, especially during cold starts. Other symptoms include a rough idle and a noticeable decrease in fuel economy. This has been attributed to carbon buildup on the intake valves, a common issue with direct-injection engines.
    *   Solution: A common fix is to perform a walnut blasting service to remove the carbon buildup from the intake valves. In more severe cases, the fuel injectors may need to be cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leak from Timing Cover**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak near the front of the engine, specifically around the timing cover. Can result in low oil levels and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing cover gasket and resealing the timing cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during passing maneuvers has also been noted. This can be caused by worn valve bodies, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush can sometimes resolve minor issues. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be replaced or rebuilt. In severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)

**Summary**

The 2021 Lexus RX350L is a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with the engine, transmission, electrical system, exterior trim, and interior. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, with some requiring minor repairs and others necessitating more extensive and costly work.
