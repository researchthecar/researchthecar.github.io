The 2005 Lexus LS430 is a luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and exceptional reliability. It came with one engine option: a 4.3L V8 (3UZ-FE) producing 290 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its comfort, build quality, and longevity, while some may find its styling understated and its technology slightly dated compared to newer vehicles. Some owners have reported wishing for better fuel economy and more engaging driving dynamics.

    *   Solution: Replace the failed air struts. Options include replacing with OEM air struts, aftermarket air struts, or converting to a traditional coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+ depending on the chosen solution. Coil spring conversion is generally the cheapest option.
