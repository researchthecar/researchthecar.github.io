The 2004 Lexus LS430 is a luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and reputation for reliability. It came standard with a 4.3L (3UZ-FE) V8 engine producing 290 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. The only available transmission option was a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise its comfortable ride, build quality, and longevity. Common dislikes include a somewhat dated interior, less sporty handling compared to some competitors, and fuel economy that isn't class-leading.

**Engine**

**4.3L (3UZ-FE) V8**

*   **VVTi Oil Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Valve Timing Actuator (VVTi) oil line can develop cracks and leak oil. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if left unaddressed. Symptoms include visible oil leaks near the VVTi actuator, oil spots under the car, and potentially a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking VVTi oil line with an updated metal line instead of the original rubber hose.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (General)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Older LS430s can develop oil leaks from various seals and gaskets, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots under the car and a burning oil smell if oil drips onto the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the location and severity of the leak; can range from $150 for a valve cover gasket to $1000+ for a rear main seal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin A761E 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience a shudder or vibration, particularly at low speeds and during light acceleration, indicating a torque converter issue.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission flush with the correct Toyota WS fluid. If the shudder persists, torque converter replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for a fluid change; $800 - $1500+ for torque converter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The optional air suspension system is prone to failure over time, resulting in a sagging vehicle, uneven ride height, or the inability to adjust ride height. This can be caused by leaks in the air struts, a failing compressor, or issues with the air suspension control module.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air struts with new OEM struts, aftermarket air struts, or convert to a coil-over suspension system. Replacing the compressor or control module may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per strut (OEM); $400 - $800 per strut (aftermarket); $200 - $500 for compressor; $300-$1000+ coilover conversion kit.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The lower control arm bushings can wear out, leading to clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can also affect handling and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn lower control arm bushings or the entire lower control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side, depending on whether just the bushings or the entire arm is replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen can fade, become dim, or fail completely. This is often due to aging capacitors in the screen's circuitry.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the navigation screen, or repair of the screen's circuit board (requires specialized skills).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on repair vs. replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks may fail to operate intermittently or completely, often affecting one or more doors. This is usually due to a faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **HID Headlight Ballast Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or both HID headlights may flicker, turn off intermittently, or fail to ignite. This is often due to a failing headlight ballast.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty headlight ballast.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per headlight.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dash Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In hotter climates, the dashboard can develop cracks over time due to sun exposure and heat.
    *   Solution: Dash cover, or dash replacement (expensive and labor-intensive).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100 for dash cover, $1000 - $2000+ for dash replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Lexus LS430 is generally a very reliable vehicle, but like any car of this age, it's prone to certain issues. The most common concerns revolve around oil leaks, air suspension failure (if equipped), and electrical components. The severity of these issues varies, but repairs can range from relatively inexpensive to quite costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the car for any signs of these common problems before purchasing.
