*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Clean the surrounding area to ensure proper sealing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ (depending on the location of the leak and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VVTi (Variable Valve Timing) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VVTi system can sometimes develop issues, leading to rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and a loss of power. This can be caused by a faulty VVTi solenoid or oil sludge buildup.
    *   Solution: Replace the VVTi solenoid, flush the engine with a cleaner if sludge is present, and perform regular oil changes to prevent future buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (A650E)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Hard Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported transmission slipping, particularly between gears, or hard/delayed shifts. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn clutch packs, or a faulty valve body.
    *   Solution: Check and top off transmission fluid, replace the transmission fluid and filter, or rebuild/replace the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3000+ (rebuild or replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some LS430s were equipped with an air suspension system. This system is prone to failure over time, with common issues including leaks in the air struts or lines, and a failing air compressor. Symptoms include a sagging vehicle (especially after sitting overnight), a warning light on the dashboard, and a noisy air compressor.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air struts, repair or replace the air lines, or replace the air compressor. Many owners choose to convert to a conventional coil-over suspension system as a more reliable and cost-effective long-term solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the component and whether converting to coil-over suspension)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The lower control arm bushings can wear out over time, leading to clunking noises when going over bumps, imprecise steering, and uneven tire wear.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen can sometimes fail, exhibiting symptoms like a blank screen, flickering, or distorted display. This is often due to a faulty screen or internal components.
    *   Solution: Replace the navigation screen or repair the internal components (if possible).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
