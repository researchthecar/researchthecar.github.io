The 2021 Lexus IS300 marked the beginning of the fourth generation of the IS line, though it's often considered a significant refresh of the previous generation. The IS300 comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four engine producing 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission in rear-wheel-drive configuration or a six-speed automatic in all-wheel drive. A more powerful 3.5-liter V6 engine is available in the IS350, generating 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Many appreciate the IS300 for its comfortable ride, stylish interior, and reputation for reliability. Criticisms often center around its somewhat dated infotainment system and the less-than-thrilling performance of the base engine compared to rivals.

Symptoms may include the low oil level warning light illuminating on the dashboard, visible blue smoke from the exhaust, and a noticeable drop in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels diligently and topping off as needed. In more severe cases, the issue may be caused by faulty piston rings or valve stem seals, requiring engine repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $7,000+ for engine repair or replacement.

    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, more extensive repairs, such as valve body replacement or transmission rebuild, may be necessary.
