The 2022 Lexus IS300 is a luxury sport sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and reputation for reliability. It offers a blend of engaging driving dynamics and Lexus's signature refinement. However, like any vehicle, it's not without its potential issues. Common positive points are the vehicle's comfortable interior, distinctive exterior styling, and smooth ride quality. Some common complaints focus on the somewhat dated infotainment system, smaller rear seat space compared to competitors, and the less-than-thrilling performance of the base engine. The 2022 IS300 is available with a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission for the rear-wheel-drive model. Alternatively, there's a 3.5L V6 engine in the IS350, producing 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. The IS300 AWD model also uses a variant of the 3.5L V6, tuned to 260 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
