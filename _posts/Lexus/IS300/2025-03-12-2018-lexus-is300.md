**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (8AR-FTS)**

*   **Excessive Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct-injected engines like the 2.0L turbo can experience carbon buildup on the intake valves over time, leading to rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves, or walnut blasting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak from Water Pump**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking from the water pump area. Overheating if coolant levels drop significantly.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump and coolant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A860E 8-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears. This may be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can improve shifting smoothness. In other instances, valve body replacement or more extensive transmission repair might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Lower Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can also lead to vague steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lower control arm bushings or the entire lower control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Discoloration/Cracking**

**Summary**

The 2018 Lexus IS300 with the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine generally exhibits good reliability. The most significant concerns involve potential carbon buildup on the intake valves, rough shifting in the 8-speed transmission, premature wear of lower control arm bushings, infotainment system issues, battery drain, and dashboard discoloration/cracking. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences like rough shifting (potentially solved with a fluid flush) to more costly repairs like dashboard replacement. Overall, while these issues exist, they don't appear to be widespread across all 2018 IS300 models. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have a pre-purchase inspection performed to identify any existing issues.
