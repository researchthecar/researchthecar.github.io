The 2003 Lexus IS300 is a sporty compact sedan known for its engaging driving dynamics, reliable Toyota engineering, and distinctive styling. It came equipped with a 3.0-liter 2JZ-GE inline-six engine, producing 215 horsepower and 218 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission (later years only). Owners appreciate the IS300 for its responsive handling, smooth engine, and overall build quality. Common complaints typically revolve around age-related issues, like worn suspension components and some electrical quirks.

**Engine**

**3.0L 2JZ-GE Inline-Six**

*   **VVTi Gear Failure (Variable Valve Timing)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. This is due to the wear or failure of the Variable Valve Timing (VVTi) gear, which controls the camshaft timing based on engine load and speed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VVTi gear. It's often recommended to replace the timing belt and water pump at the same time, as these components need to be removed for the VVTi gear replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket, Cam Seals, Rear Main Seal)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks under the car or around the engine, burning oil smell, low oil level. These are common issues with older engines due to gasket and seal degradation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets and seals. Valve cover gaskets are the most common and easiest to replace. Cam seals and the rear main seal require more labor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gasket $150 - $300, Cam seals $300 - $600, Rear main seal $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A650E 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. This can be due to worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush (if the fluid is dirty). In more severe cases, a valve body rebuild or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $100 - $200, Valve body rebuild $500 - $1000, Transmission replacement $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**W55 5-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and vague steering. The rubber bushings in the control arms, sway bar links, and other suspension components wear out over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings. It's often easier and sometimes cheaper to replace the entire control arm assembly rather than just the bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushing replacement $200 - $500+ per corner (depending on the bushing), Control arm replacement $300 - $700+ per corner
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll. The struts and shocks lose their damping ability over time, leading to a compromised ride.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the struts and shocks. It's recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent flickering or dimming of the instrument cluster lights. This can be caused by faulty capacitors or other components within the cluster.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster. Some owners opt to have the cluster rebuilt by a specialized repair shop.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Repair $200 - $500, Replacement $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, rough running engine. Oxygen sensors are used to monitor the exhaust gases and can fail over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor. There are typically multiple oxygen sensors on the IS300.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings. This can be caused by damaged seals or cracks in the housings.
    *   Solution: Removal of the headlights and resealing them. Replacement of the headlights is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Resealing $100 - $300, Replacement $300 - $800+ per headlight
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in warmer climates. This is a common issue with older vehicles and can be exacerbated by sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement (expensive and labor-intensive) or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dashboard cover $50 - $200, Dashboard replacement $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window not going up or down, or moving very slowly. The power window regulators can fail over time, especially with frequent use.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Lexus IS300 is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any older car, it's prone to certain issues as it ages. Engine and transmission issues tend to be less frequent than suspension and electrical problems, but can be more expensive to address when they do occur. Suspension bushing wear and electrical quirks are common and should be inspected carefully before purchase. Overall, the severity of potential problems ranges from minor inconveniences to more costly repairs. Addressing issues promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and driving enjoyment.
