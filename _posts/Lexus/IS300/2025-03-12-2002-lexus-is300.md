The 2002 Lexus IS300 is a sporty sedan known for its inline-six engine, rear-wheel drive, and overall reliability. It was available with only one engine option: a 3.0-liter 2JZ-GE inline-six engine producing 215 horsepower and 218 lb-ft of torque. It came standard with a five-speed automatic transmission, but a five-speed manual was offered starting in 2002. People appreciate the IS300 for its responsive handling, smooth engine, and comfortable interior. Common complaints revolve around its somewhat dated styling, fuel economy (relative to newer cars), and the age-related issues that come with owning a 20+ year old car.
