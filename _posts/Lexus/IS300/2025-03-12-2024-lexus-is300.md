The 2024 Lexus IS300 is a luxury sports sedan known for its comfortable ride, sleek styling, and refined interior. The IS300 comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 3.5-liter V6 producing 260 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque in the IS300 AWD model and a higher-output 3.5-liter V6 producing 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque in the IS350 models. All engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission, except for the IS350, which uses an eight-speed automatic. Owners often praise the IS300's comfortable seats, quiet cabin, and user-friendly infotainment system.

**Summary**

The 2024 Lexus IS300 appears to be a generally reliable vehicle, with most reported issues being relatively minor, primarily relating to the infotainment system or interior noises. The most concerning issue is the potential for rough shifting in the 8-speed automatic transmission paired with the higher-output V6 engine, which could lead to more significant repair costs if the valve body needs replacement. The cost of repairs appears to be fairly affordable but could potentially be costly if issues require more complex fixes.
