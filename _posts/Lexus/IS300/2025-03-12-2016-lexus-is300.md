The 2016 Lexus IS300 is a popular compact luxury sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and Lexus reliability. The IS300 comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 255 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission for rear-wheel drive models and a six-speed automatic with all-wheel drive. Other engine options for the 2016 IS include the IS200t, with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, and the IS350, with a more powerful version of the 3.5-liter V6. Owners often praise the IS300 for its smooth ride, attractive interior, and overall build quality. Common dislikes include the somewhat cramped rear seating and the infotainment system, which can feel dated compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, carbon deposits can accumulate on the intake valves, especially in direct-injection engines. This can lead to rough idling, reduced power, decreased fuel economy, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: A professional intake valve cleaning service, such as walnut blasting, is typically required to remove the carbon buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump may fail, leading to coolant leaks and overheating. Symptoms include a whining noise from the engine, visible coolant leaks near the water pump, and rising engine temperature.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump, often along with the thermostat and coolant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, especially between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during cold starts or in stop-and-go traffic.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, more extensive repairs such as valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) to $3,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Creaking/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported creaking or squeaking noises coming from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning at low speeds. This is commonly caused by worn or dry suspension bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings) can resolve the issue. Lubricating the bushings may provide temporary relief.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the specific bushings and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can occur, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly or if there is a parasitic drain from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Have the electrical system tested for parasitic drains. Replace the battery if it is old or weak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000+ for dashboard replacement; $50 - $200 for a dashboard cover
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Lexus IS300 is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it has its share of potential issues. Common problems include carbon buildup on the intake valves, water pump failure, harsh shifting, suspension noises, infotainment system glitches, and battery drain. While dashboard cracking can occur, the severity and cost of these issues vary. Overall, the IS300 is a well-regarded vehicle with a reputation for reliability, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing.
