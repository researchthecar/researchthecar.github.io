**Summary**

The 2011 Lexus GX460 generally exhibits good reliability, but owners should be aware of potential issues, especially concerning the air suspension, timing cover oil leaks, and interior components like the dashboard and navigation system. Repairs can be costly, particularly those involving the air suspension or replacing major components like the dashboard or navigation system. While the powertrain is generally robust, torque converter shudder is a concern on the transmission and valve cover or timing cover oil leaks are a concern on the engine. Potential buyers should inspect these areas carefully before purchasing and factor in the potential for these repairs when considering the overall cost of ownership.
