**Summary**

The 2010 Lexus GX 460 is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any car, it has its share of potential issues. The most common concerns involve the engine (valve cover leaks, secondary air injection system) and the suspension (air suspension and KDSS). Electrical gremlins with the navigation system can also occur. While some of these issues, like the valve cover leaks, are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others like air suspension or KDSS problems can be costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchasing, paying close attention to suspension components, engine bay leaks, and the functionality of the infotainment system.
