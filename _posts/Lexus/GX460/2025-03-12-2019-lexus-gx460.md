**Summary**

The 2019 Lexus GX 460, while generally reliable, is not without its potential issues. The most common problems involve the engine (valve cover leaks, water pump failure), transmission (torque converter shudder), and suspension (air suspension issues on equipped models). Electrical glitches in the infotainment system and parking sensors can also occur. Rust can be a concern in certain climates. While some issues like dashboard delamination are cosmetic, others like valve cover leaks or water pump failure can lead to significant repair costs if left unaddressed. Overall, issues are moderate in severity and can range widely in cost, from a few hundred dollars for a fluid flush to several thousand for a transmission replacement. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify and address any potential problems before acquiring a used 2019 Lexus GX 460.
