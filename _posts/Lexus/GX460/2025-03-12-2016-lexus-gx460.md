The 2016 Lexus GX 460 is a body-on-frame SUV known for its off-road capability, luxurious interior, and reliability. It comes with a single engine and transmission option: a 4.6-liter V8 engine producing 301 horsepower and 329 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the GX 460's comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and strong resale value. Common complaints include its relatively poor fuel economy, dated infotainment system, and somewhat cumbersome handling in tight spaces.

**Engine**

    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the water pump area, overheating, and possible engine damage.  A whining noise may be audible from the front of the engine.
    * Solution: Replacement of the water pump and potentially the thermostat and coolant.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report occasional harsh shifting, particularly when cold, or hesitation when accelerating. This is sometimes accompanied by a clunking noise.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and replacement can alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild)

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear air suspension can fail, causing the vehicle to sag in the rear. This is often indicated by a warning light on the dashboard.  The compressor may also run continuously or fail.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air springs or the air suspension compressor. Some owners opt to replace the air suspension with a traditional coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per air spring, $500 - $1000 for compressor replacement. Coil spring conversion varies widely.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **KDSS (Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System) Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: KDSS is standard on the GX460. The KDSS system can experience leaks, leading to reduced off-road articulation and potentially affecting handling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking KDSS components, such as seals, hoses, or accumulators.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, or complete failure of the navigation and infotainment system. The system is generally regarded as dated, which can lead to a perceived lack of responsiveness.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available) or replacement of the head unit. Aftermarket head units are a common upgrade.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Software Updates) $500 - $1500+ (Head Unit Replacement)

    * Description/Symptoms: Frame rust, particularly in areas with high road salt usage. This can weaken the frame and compromise vehicle safety.
    * Solution: Rust mitigation with rust converter and protective coatings. In severe cases, frame repair or replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (rust mitigation) - $5,000+ (frame replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Lexus GX 460 is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues with the air suspension, KDSS system, valve cover leaks, and infotainment system. Frame rust is also a concern, especially in areas with road salt usage. While some repairs can be costly, the GX 460's overall dependability and build quality often outweigh these potential issues. The severity of the issues can range from minor inconveniences like infotainment glitches to more serious problems like air suspension failure. Repair costs vary accordingly, with suspension and engine-related issues potentially costing several thousand dollars to resolve.
