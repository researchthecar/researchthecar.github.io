- **Cost:** $500 - $2,000


### Battery Drain
**Parasitic Battery Drain**
- **Symptoms:** Battery dies unexpectedly, requires frequent jump starts.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis to identify the source of the drain (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory). Repair or replace the faulty component.
- **Cost:** $200 - $800

### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Lexus LX570 is a highly reliable luxury SUV, particularly in its powertrain. The 5.7L V8 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission are known for their durability and longevity, with no widespread issues reported. The primary areas where owners might encounter problems are related to the advanced suspension systems (KDSS and AVS), which can develop leaks or component failures over time, leading to a less comfortable ride and potentially costly repairs. Electrical issues, such as infotainment glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted but are not pervasive. Interior wear on leather is typical for a vehicle of this age. Overall, the LX570 offers excellent long-term reliability, with most potential issues being manageable and repairable, especially when addressed proactively.
