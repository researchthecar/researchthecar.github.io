The most common problems relate to the air suspension system (compressor and struts) and the engine (oil leaks, water pump). Transmission shudder is a possibility. While the issues aren't necessarily widespread, the repair costs can be significant due to the vehicle's complexity and the use of specialized parts. The severity of potential issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more serious mechanical failures. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed to identify any existing or potential problems.
