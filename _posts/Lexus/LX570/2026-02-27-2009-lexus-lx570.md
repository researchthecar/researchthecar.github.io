### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Lexus LX570 is a highly reliable luxury SUV, largely due to its robust Toyota underpinnings. The powertrain (engine and transmission) is exceptionally durable with no widespread reported issues. The primary areas where owners might encounter costs are related to the advanced suspension systems (KDSS and AVS), which can develop leaks or component failures over time, and some electrical gremlins like infotainment glitches or parasitic battery drain. Interior and exterior components generally hold up well. Regular maintenance is key, but beyond that, the LX570 offers a strong track record for dependability, making it a solid choice for those seeking a long-lasting, capable luxury SUV.
