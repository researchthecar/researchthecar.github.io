The 2017 Lexus LX570 is a full-size luxury SUV known for its off-road capabilities, luxurious interior, and reliability. It comes equipped with a 5.7L V8 engine producing 383 horsepower and 403 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the LX570's smooth ride, comfortable seats, and quiet cabin. However, some have noted its dated infotainment system, lower fuel economy, and high price tag.

**Engine**

**5.7L V8 (3UR-FE)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, typically from the valve cover gaskets or timing cover gasket. This can lead to low oil levels, engine noise, and potential damage if left unaddressed. Visible oil drips under the vehicle can be an indicator.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the leak location.

*   **Secondary Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, and potential stalling. The secondary air injection system helps reduce emissions during cold starts. Failure of the pump or valves can trigger the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty secondary air injection pump and/or valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+

**Transmission**

**A760F 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable harsh or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears. This may be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and/or replacing the valve body. In some cases, complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300+ for fluid flush, $1500 - $4000+ for valve body replacement or transmission replacement.

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LX570's adjustable air suspension system can experience issues, including compressor failure, air leaks in the lines or airbags, and leveling problems. This can result in a sagging vehicle, a bumpy ride, or the inability to adjust the ride height.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor, air springs (bags), or air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ depending on the component that fails.

*   **Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) allows the vehicle to adjust the damping force of the shock absorbers in response to driving conditions. Failure of an AVS actuator can lead to a rough ride and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty AVS actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ per actuator.

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Freezing or Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software update. In more severe cases, the entire head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $2000+ (for head unit replacement).

*   **Power Tailgate Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power tailgate may fail to open or close properly, or may make unusual noises. This can be due to a faulty motor, sensor, or strut.
    * Solution: Replacing the tailgate motor, sensor, or strut.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Running Board Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic running boards may fail to deploy or retract properly. This can be caused by a faulty motor, sensor, or hinge.
    *   Solution: Replacing the running board motor, sensor, or hinge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per running board.

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement is the only true fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

**Recalls:**
*   **Recall Number 18V685000** - Description: Lexus is recalling certain 2017-2019 GX460 and LX570 vehicles. The subject vehicles may be equipped with a fuel tank which has an improperly welded vent pipe. Solution: Lexus will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the fuel tank, and if necessary, replace it, free of charge.

**Summary:**

The 2017 Lexus LX570 is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues with the engine (oil leaks, secondary air injection pump failure), transmission (harsh shifting), suspension (air suspension problems), electrical system (infotainment issues, power tailgate malfunctions), exterior (running board malfunctions), and interior (cracked dashboard). The severity and cost of these issues can vary, with some requiring relatively inexpensive repairs while others can be quite costly.
