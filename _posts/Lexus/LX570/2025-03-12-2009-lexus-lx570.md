The 2009 Lexus LX570 is a full-size luxury SUV known for its off-road capabilities, luxurious interior, and robust build quality. It came standard with a 5.7-liter V8 engine (383 horsepower and 403 lb-ft of torque), paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its reliability, comfortable ride, and spaciousness, while common complaints include poor fuel economy and the large size which makes it difficult to park.

**Engine**

**5.7L V8 (3UR-FE)**

*   **Secondary Air Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes related to the secondary air injection system (e.g., P0418, P2440, P2442). This system helps reduce emissions during cold starts. The pump can fail due to moisture intrusion, leading to corrosion and malfunction. This can also damage the valve.
    *   Solution: Replace the secondary air injection pump and potentially the valve. Some owners attempt to relocate the pump to a drier location to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve covers, leading to a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be caused by a failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle rides lower than normal, the air suspension warning light illuminates, and the compressor may be noisy or not functioning at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle sags on one or more corners, especially overnight. This indicates a leak in the air suspension struts.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air suspension struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+ per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may freeze, glitch, or become unresponsive. The system may have difficulty recognizing DVDs or CDs.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update may resolve the issue. More severe cases may require replacement of the navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the issue and solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not driven for several days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replace the faulty component. Common culprits include the navigation system, seat heaters, and door lock actuators.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Folding Mirror Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power folding mirrors may fail to open or close properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected mirror assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1,000+ per mirror
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking or splitting of the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500-$3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

In summary, the 2009 Lexus LX570, while generally reliable, has some common issues. The air suspension can be a costly repair due to potential compressor or strut failures. Electrical issues with the navigation system and parasitic battery drains can also occur. Engine issues, like secondary air injection pump failure, are also commonly noted. While most issues do not render the vehicle undriveable, the costs associated with these repairs can be significant, especially considering the vehicle's age.
