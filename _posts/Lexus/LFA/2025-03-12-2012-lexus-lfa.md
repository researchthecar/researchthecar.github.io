The 2012 Lexus LFA is a rare and iconic supercar, celebrated for its high-revving, naturally aspirated 4.8L V10 engine. This engine produces 553 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. There were no other engine or transmission options available for the LFA, as it came exclusively with a rear-mounted Aisin six-speed Automated Sequential Gearbox (ASG). Owners adore the LFA for its unique engine sound, exceptional handling, and exclusivity. Criticisms generally center around its relatively high price point, some feeling the interior appointments didn't quite match the supercar price tag, and some finding the single-clutch transmission less refined than modern dual-clutch systems.

**Engine**

**4.8L V10**

*   **Valve Spring Issue**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of valve spring failure, leading to misfires, engine knocking, and potential engine damage. This seems to be more prevalent in LFAs that see frequent high-RPM usage, such as track days.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve springs with updated, stronger units. A full engine inspection is recommended to assess any collateral damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ depending on collateral damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin 6-Speed ASG**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The single-clutch Automated Sequential Gearbox (ASG), while offering rapid shifts, can exhibit premature clutch wear, particularly with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slippage during gear changes, jerky engagement, and difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Actuator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electronic shift actuators in the ASG can sometimes experience issues, leading to delayed or failed gear changes. This can manifest as the transmission getting stuck in gear or refusing to shift altogether.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement or repair of the affected shift actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LFA's suspension utilizes advanced dampers that are prone to failure. Symptoms include diminished ride quality, uneven tire wear, and compromised handling. This is more common in LFAs that see regular track use or are driven on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+ for a set of four, depending on source and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The older navigation system is prone to failure, which causes issues with map displays, GPS tracking, and general system sluggishness.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the navigation unit or repair of the existing unit, depending on the nature of the failure. Replacement with an aftermarket option is also possible.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some LFA owners have reported delamination of the carbon fiber trim on the center console, causing the clear coat to peel or bubble.
    *   Solution: Refinishing or replacement of the delaminated carbon fiber trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Lexus LFA, while an exceptional supercar, isn't entirely immune to issues. The most concerning issues revolve around the engine (valve springs) and transmission (clutch wear, shift actuators), which can be costly to repair. Suspension damper failure and navigation system issues are also reported. Overall, given the rarity and specialized nature of the LFA, maintenance and repairs tend to be expensive. Careful inspection and preventative maintenance are crucial for LFA ownership. While the issues can be severe, the LFA's overall reliability is decent given the vehicle's complexity.
