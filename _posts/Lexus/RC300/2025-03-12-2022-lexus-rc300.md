**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (RC300)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.0L Turbocharged inline-4 engine consuming oil at a higher-than-expected rate. Symptoms include needing to add oil between scheduled oil changes and the low oil level warning light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Addressing excessive oil consumption can involve several steps. Initially, a dealer or qualified mechanic may perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of oil loss. If the consumption is deemed excessive, potential solutions range from replacing the PCV valve to address crankcase pressure issues or even replacing piston rings or the engine itself in more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$5000+ depending on the severity and the required repair.

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All RC300)**

* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can manifest as a noticeable lurch or hesitation during acceleration.
    * Solution: A potential fix involves performing a transmission fluid flush and software recalibration. In more severe cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$2500+
*   **Hesitation When Accelerating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners might encounter a noticeable hesitation when accelerating from a stop or at lower speeds. This can feel like a delay in response when pressing the accelerator pedal.
    *   Solution: The solution often involves software recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM) to improve shift timing and responsiveness. In some cases, inspecting and cleaning or replacing the mass airflow sensor (MAF) can also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, including the display screen and associated functions (navigation, audio, etc.), may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart.

**Summary:**

The 2022 Lexus RC 300 appears to have relatively few widespread, major issues. The most common concerns seem to revolve around the engine's oil consumption and transmission smoothness and infotainment system glitches.
