### Summary Verdict

The powertrain, including the 3.5L V6 engine and its associated automatic transmissions (8-speed for RWD, 6-speed for AWD), shows no significant widespread issues. Similarly, the suspension, exterior, and interior components are generally robust. The primary areas where minor concerns have been noted are within the electrical system, specifically occasional infotainment system glitches and, less commonly, premature battery failure. These issues are typically resolvable with software updates or component replacement and do not detract significantly from the vehicle's overall dependability. Owners can expect a reliable luxury coupe with minimal major technical concerns.
