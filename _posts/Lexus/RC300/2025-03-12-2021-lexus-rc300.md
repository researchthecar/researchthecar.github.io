The 2021 Lexus RC300 is a luxury coupe known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and Lexus's reputation for reliability. The RC300 is the base trim level, and comes with a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The RC is also available as the RC350, which features a 3.5L V6 producing 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. The RC300 RWD comes with an 8-speed automatic transmission.
