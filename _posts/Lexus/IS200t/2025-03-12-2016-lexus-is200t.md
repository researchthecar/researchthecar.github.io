**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (200t)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct-injection engines, like the 2.0L turbo in the IS200t, are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves. This occurs because fuel is directly injected into the cylinder rather than passing over the valves, which leaves no fuel to clean the valves. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased fuel economy, loss of power, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: A walnut blasting or chemical cleaning of the intake valves is typically performed to remove the carbon buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure. Symptoms include a loss of power, whistling or whining noises from the engine bay, and potentially an engine check light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. It's recommended to check the oil lines for blockages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 (300 and 350)**

* **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The water pump has been known to fail. Symptoms can include coolant leaking, overheating, and engine damage if not properly monitored.
    * Solution: Replacement of the water pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (AWR80)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough shifting, especially between lower gears, or hesitation when accelerating. This can manifest as jerky movements or a delay in response when pressing the gas pedal.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with the correct Lexus/Toyota WS fluid *may* alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild might be necessary. Start with the fluid flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush: $200 - $400. Valve Body Replacement: $1,500 - $3,000+. Transmission Rebuild: $3,000 - $5,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Creaking/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported creaking or squeaking noises coming from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning. This is often attributed to worn bushings or ball joints.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn suspension components, such as bushings, ball joints, or sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushings: $200 - $500 per corner. Ball Joints: $300 - $600 per corner. Sway Bar Links: $100 - $300 per corner.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: A software update or a system reset may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: Typically free at the dealership. Infotainment Unit Replacement: $1,000 - $3,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failure (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of parking sensors or blind spot monitoring systems can occur. Symptoms include inaccurate readings or the system not functioning at all.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: In some climates, the dashboard can develop cracks, especially in direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Repair: $300-$800. Replacement: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Lexus IS200t has some common issues, with the most prevalent being carbon buildup on the intake valves of the 2.0L turbo engine. Other potential problems include turbocharger failure, rough shifting with the 8-speed automatic transmission, and electrical glitches with the infotainment system. Suspension noises and dashboard cracking are also reported by some owners. The severity of these issues varies, with carbon buildup being a relatively common maintenance item, while turbocharger or transmission issues can be more costly to repair. Overall, while these issues can occur, the IS200t generally maintains a reputation for reliability, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. The water pump failure and the rough shifting/hesitation on the 8-speed are common issues on all IS models.
