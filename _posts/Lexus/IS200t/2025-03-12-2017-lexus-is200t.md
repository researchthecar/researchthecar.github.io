The 2017 Lexus IS200t is a luxury sport sedan known for its comfortable ride, sleek styling, and reliability. It's powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While the IS200t was the entry-level engine option for the IS line, higher trims such as the IS300 were offered with a 3.5L V6 engine, and the IS350, a higher output of the same 3.5L V6. Owners generally appreciate the IS200t's fuel efficiency, smooth ride, and Lexus's reputation for dependability. However, some criticisms include the relatively small rear seats, the somewhat dated infotainment system, and the less engaging driving experience compared to some of its rivals.
