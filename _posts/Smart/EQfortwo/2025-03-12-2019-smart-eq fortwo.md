The 2019 Smart EQ fortwo is a fully electric microcar designed for urban environments. It lacks a traditional combustion engine and instead relies on an electric motor. The 2019 model features an 80-horsepower electric motor producing 118 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Smart EQ fortwo for its exceptional maneuverability, ease of parking, and zero-emissions operation. Common dislikes include its limited range, small size, and compromised cargo space.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor (80 hp)**

*   **Reduced Range in Cold Weather**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report a significant decrease in driving range during colder temperatures. The battery's capacity is affected by the cold, leading to shorter trips and more frequent charging.
    *   Solution: Preconditioning the battery while plugged in can help mitigate the range loss. Parking in a garage or sheltered area can also help. There is no mechanical fix for this.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Degradation Over Time**
    *   Description/Symptoms: As the vehicle ages, the battery's maximum capacity gradually diminishes, resulting in a reduced driving range compared to the original specification. The rate of degradation can vary depending on usage and charging habits.
    *   Solution: While some degradation is inevitable, it can be minimized by avoiding frequent fast charging, and keeping the battery charged between 20-80% when possible. Replacement of the battery pack is the only permanent solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The small 12V auxiliary battery can drain quickly, especially if the car is left unused for extended periods. This can prevent the car from starting or accessing the charging system.
    * Solution: Use a trickle charger to maintain the 12V battery's charge, especially during periods of inactivity. Check the battery's health regularly and replace it when necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes entirely. This can affect navigation, audio playback, and other features.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. A hard reset of the system may also be necessary. In severe cases, replacement of the head unit might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $500+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Summary:**

The 2019 Smart EQ fortwo generally presents a mixed bag of common issues. The most concerning is the inevitable battery degradation, leading to reduced range and potential costly replacement down the road. Issues with the 12V battery and infotainment system are generally less severe and costly to address. While the limited range and small size are inherent to the car's design, potential buyers should carefully consider these factors and the impact of cold weather on battery performance before purchasing.
