**Introduction:**

The 2006 Smart Forfour was a subcompact hatchback available with two engine options: a 1.1-liter inline-three and a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-three. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 6-speed automatic transmission. Despite its compact size, the Forfour offered a spacious and configurable interior, but was criticized for its sluggish performance and high fuel consumption.
