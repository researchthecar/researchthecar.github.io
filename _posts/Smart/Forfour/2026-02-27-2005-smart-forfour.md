### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Smart Forfour presents a mixed reliability profile. While the petrol engines and manual transmissions are generally robust, the semi-automatic gearbox has known issues with its actuator and hydraulic system. Diesel models can experience turbocharger and glow plug problems. Suspension components, particularly bushings and shock absorbers, may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and fuse box issues, are not uncommon. Interior components like the air conditioning and central locking actuators can also be sources of concern. Owners should be aware of these potential issues, especially when purchasing a used model, and factor in potential repair costs.
