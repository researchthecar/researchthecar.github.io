### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Smart Forfour presents a mixed reliability profile. While the petrol engines are generally robust, the automated manual 'Softouch' transmission is a notable area for potential issues, particularly with the clutch actuator and gearbox operation. Suspension components like bushings and shock absorbers can wear, leading to common driving comfort and handling complaints. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and instrument cluster faults, are also reported. Interior components like the air conditioning and central locking can also require attention. Owners should be aware of these potential weak points, especially when considering a used model, and factor in potential repair costs for the transmission and electrical systems.
