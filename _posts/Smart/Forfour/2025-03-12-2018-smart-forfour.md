The 2018 Smart Forfour is a quirky and compact city car known for its nimble handling and ease of parking. Available engine options included a 1.0-liter naturally aspirated three-cylinder engine producing around 71 horsepower and 67 lb-ft of torque, a 0.9-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine generating approximately 89 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque, and an all-electric powertrain in some markets. Transmission choices typically included a five-speed manual or a six-speed dual-clutch automatic. Owners often appreciate its small size for urban environments and distinctive styling, while common complaints revolve around its limited cargo space, firm ride, and somewhat underpowered engine options.
