The 2004 Smart City-Coupe, also known as the Fortwo in some markets, is a microcar known for its compact size and fuel efficiency. The 2004 model was primarily offered with a 0.7-liter turbocharged inline-3 gasoline engine, producing around 60 horsepower and 59 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automated manual transmission. Some models had a diesel engine option. Owners often appreciate its maneuverability and parking ease in urban environments. However, common dislikes include its somewhat jerky transmission, limited cargo space, and unconventional styling.

**Summary**
The 2004 Smart City-Coupe, while charming in its design and practicality, can be prone to specific issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine's turbocharger and oil leaks, as well as the transmission's clutch actuator. Suspension and electrical problems, like spring failures and alternator issues, also commonly affect the vehicle. The instrument cluster and rear window can have issues as well. While some repairs may be relatively inexpensive, others, particularly those involving the turbocharger or transmission, can be costly, potentially ranging from several hundred to over a thousand dollars. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas or seek a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic.
