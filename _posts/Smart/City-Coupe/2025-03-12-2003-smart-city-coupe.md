The 2003 Smart City-Coupe (also known as the Fortwo in later years) is a quirky, ultra-compact car designed for urban environments. The most common engine option in the 2003 model is a 599cc turbocharged three-cylinder gasoline engine producing around 50 horsepower and 59 lb-ft of torque. It also came with a diesel engine as an option, though less common in some markets. The standard transmission is a 6-speed automated manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the City-Coupe's exceptional fuel economy and ease of parking in tight spaces, but criticize its jerky transmission, limited cargo space, and relatively high price for its size.
