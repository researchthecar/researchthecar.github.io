The 2005 Smart Roadster is a two-seater roadster produced by Smart. It was available with two engine options: a 0.7-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine and a 1.0-liter naturally aspirated three-cylinder engine. Both engines were paired with a five-speed automated manual transmission. The Smart Roadster was praised for its fuel efficiency and handling, but it was criticized for its cramped interior and lack of power.
