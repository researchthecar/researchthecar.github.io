The 2004 Smart Cabrio is a small, rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive city car known for its fuel efficiency and unique design. The 2004 Smart Cabrio came with a 0.7L turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing around 61 horsepower and 70 lb-ft of torque. The transmission available was a 6-speed automated manual transmission. People generally like the car's small size for easy parking and its fuel economy.
