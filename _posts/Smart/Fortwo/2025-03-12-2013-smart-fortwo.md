**Summary**

The 2013 Smart Fortwo has some known issues. The electric model batteries are degrading over time, which is normal for electric vehicles. The transmission, suspension, and electric components have the most common issues. The most serious and costly problems tend to be related to the transmission actuator failure and SAM unit failure, as well as potential battery replacement if the vehicle is electric. While some of these issues can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, especially transmission or battery related repairs, can be costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
