The 2009 Smart Fortwo is a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive two-passenger car known for its compact size and fuel efficiency. It was offered with a 1.0-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine producing 70 horsepower and 68 lb-ft of torque, paired with a five-speed automated manual transmission. The Smart Fortwo's appeal lies in its maneuverability in urban environments and its distinctive styling. However, owners often cite concerns about its ride quality, limited cargo space, and the quirky operation of the automated manual transmission.

**Engine**

**1.0L Three-Cylinder Gasoline Engine**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. Common areas include the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Catalytic converter failure is a common issue on these vehicles, often preceded by engine misfires or oil consumption. A failing catalytic converter may cause a check engine light with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420).
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automated Manual Transmission**
*   **Hesitation and Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automated manual transmission is known for its slow and jerky shifts. Owners often report hesitation when accelerating and abrupt shifts, especially between first and second gear.
    *   Solution: While a software update might improve the shift quality slightly, the fundamental design of the transmission is the main contributor to this behavior. Complete fixes may involve transmission replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software update. $1500 - $3000+ for transmission replacement or rebuild.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clutch actuator is responsible for engaging and disengaging the clutch in the automated manual transmission. Failure can result in difficulty shifting, inability to shift, or a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the car's short wheelbase and relatively stiff suspension, components such as shocks, struts, and bushings can wear out quickly, leading to a bumpy ride and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace worn shocks, struts, and bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the components replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Smart Fortwo's small battery can be prone to draining, especially in cold weather or if the car is not driven frequently.
    *   Solution: Replace the battery with a new, high-quality battery. Ensure proper charging system function.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Electrical Grounding Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to corrosion or loose connections, various electrical systems can experience intermittent problems, leading to issues with lighting, sensors, or starting the car.
    *   Solution: Clean and tighten all grounding points throughout the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the severity and location of the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Panel Alignment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported inconsistent panel gaps and alignment issues, potentially leading to wind noise or water leaks.
    *   Solution: Adjust or realign body panels as needed. This may require specialized tools and expertise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the extent of the adjustments needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows may fail to operate due to a faulty window regulator or motor.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator or motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Smart Fortwo presents a mixed bag of issues, with the automated manual transmission being a significant source of complaints due to its jerky shifting and potential for costly repairs like clutch actuator failure. Engine oil leaks and catalytic converter failures are also relatively common. Suspension wear and electrical gremlins can add to the ownership experience. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission work, can be costly. Overall, a potential buyer should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly.
