The 2011 Smart Fortwo is a quirky and compact two-seater known for its exceptional fuel economy and ease of parking in urban environments. It's powered by a 1.0-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine producing 70 horsepower and 68 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with a 5-speed automated manual transmission.
