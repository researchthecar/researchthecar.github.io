The 2005 Smart Fortwo, also known as the Smart City-Coup√©, is a microcar known for its compact size and fuel efficiency. The primary engine option for this model year is a 698cc three-cylinder turbocharged gasoline engine, producing around 61 horsepower and 70 lb-ft of torque. It was also available with a diesel engine in some markets, but we will focus on the gasoline model here. The 2005 Fortwo is generally liked for its parking ease in urban environments and its distinctive styling, but it receives criticism for its jerky automated manual transmission and limited cargo space.
