# 2010 Smart Fortwo

### Overview
The 2010 Smart Fortwo, known for its compact size and urban maneuverability, generally presents a decent reliability record for its class. As a city-focused vehicle, its design prioritizes efficiency and ease of parking over outright performance. While most owners report satisfaction with its day-to-day operation, like any vehicle, it has specific areas that have seen more attention from mechanics. The powertrain, particularly the automated manual transmission, can be a source of concern for some, and electrical gremlins, though not rampant, do appear. However, for its intended purpose, the Fortwo offers a generally dependable experience, with most issues being manageable and not indicative of systemic failure across the board.

### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Smart Fortwo is a niche vehicle best suited for urban environments. Its primary reliability concerns revolve around the automated manual transmission, specifically the clutch actuator and control module, which can lead to shifting problems. Engine-wise, while generally robust, turbocharger issues can arise on the turbocharged variants, and oil leaks are not uncommon. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and window regulator failures, are also reported. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components tend to be reliable. For its intended use, the Fortwo can be a dependable choice if these potential issues are understood and addressed.
