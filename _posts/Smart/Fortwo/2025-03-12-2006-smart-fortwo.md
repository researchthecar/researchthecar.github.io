The 2006 Smart Fortwo is a quirky and compact two-seater vehicle known for its exceptional fuel efficiency and maneuverability, making it a popular choice for urban environments. In the United States, only the 1.0L gasoline engine was available, producing around 70 horsepower and 68 lb-ft of torque. The Smart Fortwo generally appeals to drivers seeking a small footprint and easy parking, while some dislike its somewhat sluggish acceleration and limited cargo space. It is mated with a 6-speed automated manual transmission.
