The 2010 Smart Fortwo is a compact city car known for its fuel efficiency and small size, making it easy to park in crowded urban environments. It's equipped with a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine producing around 70 horsepower and 68 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automated manual transmission. While appreciated for its maneuverability and gas mileage, owners often dislike its jerky transmission, limited cargo space, and susceptibility to crosswinds at higher speeds.
