The 2012 Smart Fortwo is a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive subcompact car known for its small size and fuel efficiency. It was available as a coupe and a convertible. The only engine option was a 1.0-liter three-cylinder Mitsubishi 3B21 engine producing 70 horsepower and 68 lb-ft of torque. The transmission option was a 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT). Owners often appreciate the Fortwo for its maneuverability and parking ease in urban environments. Common complaints include its jerky transmission, limited cargo space, and susceptibility to crosswinds on the highway.
