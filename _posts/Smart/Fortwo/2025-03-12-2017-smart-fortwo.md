The 2017 Smart Fortwo is a small, two-passenger city car known for its maneuverability and fuel efficiency. It was available in both gasoline and electric versions. The gasoline version features a 0.9-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 89 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The electric version uses an electric motor that produces 80 horsepower and 118 lb-ft of torque. People often appreciate the Smart Fortwo for its small size, ease of parking, and unique styling. However, some criticisms include its limited cargo space, ride quality, and the somewhat quirky transmission in the gasoline model.
