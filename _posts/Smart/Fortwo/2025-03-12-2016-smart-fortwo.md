The 2016 Smart Fortwo is a quirky and compact two-seater car designed for urban environments. It offered a tight turning radius, easy parking, and fuel efficiency. For the 2016 model year, the Smart Fortwo was available with a 0.9L turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 89 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its small size and maneuverability, while downsides commonly cited are its limited cargo space, somewhat rough ride, and polarizing styling.
