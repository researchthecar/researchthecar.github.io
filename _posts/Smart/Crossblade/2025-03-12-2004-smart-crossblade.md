The 2004 Smart Crossblade is a unique and unconventional city car, known for its open-top, doorless design and minimalist approach. It was primarily offered with a 599cc turbocharged three-cylinder gasoline engine producing around 70 horsepower and 70 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automated manual transmission. Owners often appreciate its quirky styling, nimble handling, and fuel efficiency, while common criticisms include its lack of practicality in inclement weather, limited storage space, and potential for high maintenance costs due to its specialized nature.
