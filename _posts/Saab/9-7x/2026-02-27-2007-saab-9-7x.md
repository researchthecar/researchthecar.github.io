### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Saab 9-7x, particularly models equipped with the V8 engine, can be susceptible to issues related to Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter failure and torque converter problems within the automatic transmission. The inline-six engine, while generally reliable, has reported instances of intake manifold gasket leaks and timing chain wear. Suspension components, especially on models with air suspension, and electrical parts like window regulators are also areas to monitor. Despite these potential concerns, many 9-7x models remain dependable with proper maintenance. Owners should be aware of these common failure points and budget for potential repairs, especially as the vehicle ages.
