**Introduction:**

The 2007 Saab 9-7x is a mid-size SUV based on the Chevrolet TrailBlazer. It was offered with a choice of two engines: a 4.2L I6 and a 5.3L V8. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic (4L60E) for the I6 and a 4-speed automatic (4L65E) for the V8.

**Engine**

**4.2L I6**
* **Timing chain stretch:**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature timing chain wear can lead to stretched chains that cause the engine to run roughly, misfire, or lose power.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chains, guides, and tensioners is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: NHTSA Campaign Number: 06V474000
* **Intake manifold gasket leak:**
    * Description/Symptoms: A leaking intake manifold gasket can cause loss of vacuum, rough idling, and increased fuel consumption.
    * Solution: Replacing the gasket and cleaning the intake manifold is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500

**5.3L V8**
* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter failure:**
    * Description/Symptoms: The AFM system can cause lifters to fail, resulting in a ticking noise, misfires, and a loss of power.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected lifters and disabling the AFM system is recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2007 Saab 9-7x is a generally reliable vehicle, but it is not without its potential issues. Timing chain stretch and intake manifold leaks affect the I6 engine, while AFM lifter failure can occur in the V8. Transmission issues such as shift solenoid problems can also arise. Interior climate control problems are another common concern. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to more serious repairs with a moderate cost. However, it's important to note that these issues are not universal, and many 9-7x owners have not experienced any significant problems with their vehicles.
