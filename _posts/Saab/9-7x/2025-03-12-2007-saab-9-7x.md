The 2007 Saab 9-7x was an attempt by Saab to enter the SUV market, based on the GMT360 platform shared with the Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Isuzu Ascender, Buick Rainier, and Oldsmobile Bravada. The 2007 Saab 9-7x came with three engine options: a 4.2L Inline-6 producing 291 hp and 277 lb-ft of torque, a 5.3L V8 producing 300 hp and 321 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.0L V8 producing 390 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque (Aero model only). All engines were paired with a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often liked the Saab 9-7x for its comfortable ride, distinctive styling (compared to its platform siblings), and relatively powerful engine options. Common dislikes included its poor fuel economy, outdated interior, and reliability issues.
