The 2005 Saab 9-7x was Saab's first SUV, a rebadged version of the Chevrolet Trailblazer. Engine options included a 4.2L inline-6 producing 275 hp and 275 lb-ft of torque and a 5.3L V8 producing 300 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the 9-7x for its comfortable ride and handling, while common complaints included its fuel economy and some reliability issues stemming from its shared platform with other GM SUVs.
