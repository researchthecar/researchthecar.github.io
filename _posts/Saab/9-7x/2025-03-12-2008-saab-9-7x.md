**Summary**

The 2008 Saab 9-7x presents a mix of common SUV issues and unique Saab-specific concerns. Engine issues range from relatively minor sensor failures to more significant oil consumption and valve spring problems. Transmission problems, particularly with the 4L60-E, can be costly. Suspension issues, especially with the air suspension (if equipped), are also prevalent. Electrical gremlins with the instrument cluster and ignition switch can be frustrating. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, particularly engine and transmission work. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and budget accordingly for potential repairs.
