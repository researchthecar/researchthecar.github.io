### Engine

**2.0-liter Inline-4**

* **Head gasket failure:** The head gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak. Symptoms include overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and loss of coolant. The solution is to replace the head gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000.
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak. Symptoms include rough idling, poor acceleration, and increased fuel consumption. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500.
* **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt can fail, causing the engine to stop running. Symptoms include a sudden loss of power and a loud noise from the engine. The solution is to replace the timing belt. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000.

**2.3-liter Inline-4**

Symptoms include oil spots on the ground beneath the car and a burning oil smell from the engine. The solution is to replace the leaking gasket or seal. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500.
* **Coolant leaks:** The 2.3-liter inline-4 engine is also known to develop coolant leaks from the water pump, the radiator, and the hoses. Symptoms include overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and loss of coolant. The solution is to replace the leaking component. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $1,000.

**3.0-liter V6**

* **Valve train wear:** The 3.0-liter V6 engine is known to develop excessive wear on the camshaft and lifters. Symptoms include a ticking noise from the engine, poor performance, and increased fuel consumption. The solution is to replace the worn components. Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $4,000.
* **Transmission problems:** The 3.0-liter V6 engine is often paired with the 4-speed automatic transmission, which is known to develop problems. Symptoms include slipping gears, difficulty shifting, and a burning smell from the transmission. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $3,000.

### Transmission

**5-speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch can fail, causing the car to be unable to move. Symptoms include a burning smell, slipping gears, and difficulty shifting. The solution is to replace the clutch. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000.
* **Synchronizer failure:** The synchronizers can fail, causing difficulty shifting gears. Symptoms include grinding noises when shifting and difficulty getting the car into gear. The solution is to replace the synchronizers. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000.

**4-speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission can slip gears, causing the car to lose power. Symptoms include a lack of power when accelerating, a burning smell from the transmission, and a grinding noise when shifting gears. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $3,000.
* **Shift solenoid failure:** The shift solenoid can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically. Symptoms include harsh shifting, delayed shifts, and a lack of power when accelerating. The solution is to replace the shift solenoid. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500.

**5-speed Automatic**

* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing the car to lose power. Symptoms include a lack of power when accelerating, a shuddering sensation when shifting gears, and a burning smell from the transmission. The solution is to replace the torque converter. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000.
* **Valve body failure:** The valve body can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically. Symptoms include harsh shifting, delayed shifts, and a lack of power when accelerating. The solution is to replace the valve body. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000.

### Suspension

* **Strut failure:** The struts can fail, causing the car to ride rough and handle poorly. Symptoms include a bouncing ride, excessive body roll, and a clunking noise from the suspension. The solution is to replace the struts. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000.
