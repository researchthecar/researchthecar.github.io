**Introduction**

The 2005 Saab 9-5 is a midsize luxury sedan that offers a combination of comfort, performance, and safety. It came with two engine options: a 2.3L turbocharged 4-cylinder and a 3.0L turbocharged V6. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The car was praised for its sleek design, comfortable interior, and solid handling, but it also had its fair share of reported issues.

**Engine**

**2.3L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** Turbochargers can fail prematurely, leading to reduced engine power and increased oil consumption. The turbochargers used in the 2005 Saab 9-5 were manufactured by Mitsubishi and are known to have issues with their wastegate actuators. Symptoms include a loss of power, increased exhaust smoke, and oil leaks.
  * Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger is necessary.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
  * Recalls: NHTSA Campaign Number: 15V332000

**3.0L Turbocharged V6**

* **Oil Consumption:** Some V6 engines consume excessive amounts of oil, which can lead to engine damage if not addressed. This issue is most prevalent in engines produced before 2006. Symptoms include a low oil level indicator light, frequent oil changes, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
  * Solution: Replacing the piston rings or valve stem seals may be required to address the oil consumption issue.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Slipping:** Transmissions may slip or shudder during gear changes, especially when shifting into higher gears. This issue is more common in early production models. Symptoms include delayed or jerky gear changes, a lack of acceleration, and a whining noise.
  * Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid, filter, and solenoids may be necessary to resolve the issue. In more severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mount Failure:** Strut mounts, which connect the struts to the vehicle body, can fail prematurely, causing clunking noises and reduced handling performance. Symptoms include a clicking or clunking sound when driving over bumps, uneven tire wear, and a shaking steering wheel.
  * Solution: Replacing the strut mounts is necessary to resolve the issue.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per side
  * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Electrical System Problems:** Electrical issues are relatively common in the 2005 Saab 9-5, including problems with the battery, starter, alternator, and wiring. Symptoms can vary widely, including difficulty starting the vehicle, dimming or flickering lights, and electrical component failures.
  * Solution: Troubleshooting and repairing or replacing the affected electrical components is necessary.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the specific electrical issue
  * Recalls: NHTSA Campaign Number: 19V149000, 16V530000

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation:** Headlights may develop condensation or water accumulation inside the lenses, which can impair visibility and damage the electrical components. Symptoms include fog or water droplets inside the headlight housing.
  * Solution: Replacing the headlight assembly is necessary to resolve the issue.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per side
  * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Pixel Failure:** The pixels on the dashboard display may fail, causing sections of the display to become blank or distorted. Symptoms include missing or flickering pixels, lines or spots on the display, and difficulty reading the instrument cluster.
  * Solution: Replacing the dashboard display is necessary to resolve the pixel failure issue.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Saab 9-5 has a number of reported issues that can range in severity and cost. The most common issues include turbocharger failure, transmission slipping, electrical problems, and headlight condensation. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more serious and costly. It is important for owners to be aware of these potential problems and to have them addressed promptly to avoid further damage or safety concerns.
