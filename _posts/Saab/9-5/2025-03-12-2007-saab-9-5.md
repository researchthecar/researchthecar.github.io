The 2007 Saab 9-5 is a mid-size luxury car known for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and turbocharged performance. Engine options included a 2.3L turbocharged inline-4 producing 260 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6. Both engines were available with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People liked the 9-5 for its unique character and safety features, but disliked its reliability issues and relatively high maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**2.3L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **Sludge Buildup**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil sludge accumulation in the engine can lead to poor lubrication, reduced performance, and eventually engine failure. This is often accompanied by a check engine light and unusual engine noises.
    * Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and using the correct oil filter is preventative. If sludge is present, the engine may need to be flushed, or in severe cases, the oil pan may need to be removed and cleaned or the engine rebuilt/replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Direct Ignition Cassette (DIC) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The DIC is responsible for providing the spark to the spark plugs. Failure results in misfires, rough running, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacement of the DIC unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Crank Position Sensor Failure**
