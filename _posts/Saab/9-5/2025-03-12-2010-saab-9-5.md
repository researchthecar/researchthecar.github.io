The 2010 Saab 9-5 marked the return of the iconic nameplate after a hiatus. It was offered with a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4, producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A 2.8L Turbocharged V6, generating 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, was also available. Both engines were typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People often praised the 2010 9-5 for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and well-appointed interior. Some common complaints included limited rear seat headroom, a complicated infotainment system, and concerns about long-term reliability due to Saab's then-uncertain future.
