The 2005 Saab 9-5 is a mid-size luxury car known for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and turbocharged engines. The 2005 model year offered two primary engine choices: a 2.3L turbocharged inline-4 producing 260 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 (not turbocharged) producing 200hp and 229 lb-ft of torque. The 2.3L Turbo was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L V6 was only available with the 4-speed automatic. People appreciate the 9-5 for its unique design, spacious interior, and spirited performance, especially from the turbocharged engine. Some common dislikes include reliability issues, higher maintenance costs, and availability of parts, given Saab's discontinuation.
