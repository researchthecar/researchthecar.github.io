The 2003 Saab 9-5 is a mid-size luxury sedan and wagon known for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and turbocharged engines. Engine options included a 2.3L turbocharged inline-4 producing 185 hp and 207 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing 200 hp and 229 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic transmission were offered. Owners often praise the 9-5 for its comfortable seats, spacious interior, and unique character. Common complaints include reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system and engine, and the increasing difficulty of finding parts and qualified mechanics due to Saab's discontinuation.

**Summary**

The 2003 Saab 9-5 can be a rewarding car to own, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine sludge (especially with the 2.3L turbo), DIC failures, and timing belt issues (on the 3.0L V6) can lead to expensive repairs. Electrical issues with the SID, central locking, and ABS are also common. Suspension and transmission problems add to the potential ownership costs. Overall, while some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential. The increasing scarcity of parts and qualified Saab technicians can also add to the challenges of ownership.
