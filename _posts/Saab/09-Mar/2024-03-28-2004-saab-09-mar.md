**Introduction**

The 2004 Saab 09-Mar is a compact luxury sedan that was offered with multiple engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four with 150 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included a 2.3-liter turbocharged inline-four (175 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.5-liter V6 (185 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque).
