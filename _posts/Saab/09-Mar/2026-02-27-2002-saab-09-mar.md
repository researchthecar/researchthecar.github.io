### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Saab 9-3, while offering a unique driving experience, presents several common reliability concerns that owners should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly oil sludge in naturally aspirated models and turbocharger problems in turbocharged variants, require diligent maintenance. Transmission issues can range from clutch wear in manuals to torque converter and solenoid problems in automatics. Electrical gremlins, such as failing ignition coils and the SID display, are also noted.
