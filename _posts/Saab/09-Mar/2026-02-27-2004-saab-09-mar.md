### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Saab 9-3 is a stylish and engaging car, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine reliability is generally good, but the PCV system and turbochargers on the 2.0T models require attention. The V6 turbo has potential timing chain issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 5-speed, can develop torque converter problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and rear springs are known to wear. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or ignition coils, can also occur. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, proactive maintenance and awareness of these specific components are key to ensuring long-term reliability for this Swedish sport sedan.
