### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Saab 9-3, while offering a unique driving experience, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and segment. The diesel engines, particularly the 1.9L JTDm, are prone to DPF and turbocharger issues. Petrol engines, especially the 2.0T, can suffer from ignition coil and PCV system problems. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 6-speed TF-80SC, may develop valve body issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or ignition switch, can also occur.
