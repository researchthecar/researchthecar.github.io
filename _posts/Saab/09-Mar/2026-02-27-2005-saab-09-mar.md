### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Saab 9-3 is a capable vehicle with a distinct character. While the naturally aspirated engines and manual transmissions tend to be quite robust, the turbocharged variants and automatic transmissions present a few more potential reliability concerns. Common issues include turbocharger problems and PCV system clogging on the 2.0T engines, and torque converter or valve body issues on the automatic transmissions. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear over time, and electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM, can occur. Interior comfort features like seat heaters and HVAC blend doors are also known to fail. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these potential issues, the 2005 Saab 9-3 can still be a rewarding car to own, especially for enthusiasts who appreciate its unique appeal.
