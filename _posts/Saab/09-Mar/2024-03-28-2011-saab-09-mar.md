The 2011 Saab 09-Mar is a compact sedan that offers a comfortable ride and stylish design. It comes with a single engine option, a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 210 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with either a six-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic transmission. While the Saab 09-Mar received praise for its handling and performance, it fell short in terms of reliability.

**Engine**
- **2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder Engine**
 - **Head Gasket Failure:** Premature failure of the head gasket, leading to coolant and oil leaks, overheating, and engine damage. 
 - **Turbocharger Failure:** Premature wear of the turbocharger components, resulting in reduced power, excessive smoke, and oil leaks. 
 - **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** Failure of the timing chain tensioner, leading to chain noise, reduced engine power, and potential engine damage. 
 - **Oil Leaks:** Various oil leaks from gaskets, seals, and components, leading to loss of oil pressure and potential engine damage. 
 - **Carbon Buildup:** Excessive carbon buildup in the intake valves, leading to reduced performance and fuel efficiency.

**Transmission**
- **Six-Speed Manual Transmission**
 - **Transmission Noise:** Excessive noise from the transmission during operation, indicating worn or damaged gears or bearings.
 - **Shifting Problems:** Difficulty shifting gears, grinding noises, or popping out of gear, indicating worn or damaged shift forks or synchronizers.
 - **Clutch Problems:** Premature wear of the clutch plates or pressure plate, leading to slipping and difficulty engaging gears. 
- **Five-Speed Automatic Transmission**
 - **Transmission Slipping:** Transmission fails to engage properly, leading to loss of power or delayed gear shifts.
 - **Shift Solenoid Failure:** Failure of the shift solenoids, leading to delayed or erratic gear shifts.
 - **Torque Converter Problems:** Premature wear or failure of the torque converter, leading to reduced power and transmission overheating.

**Suspension**
 - **Strut Mount Failure:** Premature failure of the strut mounts, leading to excessive noise, vibration, and reduced handling performance. 
 - **Shock Absorber Failure:** Premature wear of the shock absorbers, leading to poor ride quality, excessive bouncing, and reduced stability. 
 - **Sway Bar Link Failure:** Failure of the sway bar links, leading to excessive body roll and reduced stability. 

**Electrical**
 - **Battery Drain:** Excessive electrical drain on the battery, leading to premature battery discharge and difficulty starting the vehicle. 
 - **Electrical Glitches:** Intermittent electrical issues, such as malfunctioning instruments, flickering lights, or power window failures. 
 - **Alternator Failure:** Premature failure of the alternator, leading to insufficient charging of the battery and potential electrical system issues. 

**Exterior**
 - **Wiper Motor Failure:** Premature failure of the wiper motor, leading to inoperative wipers or intermittent operation. 
 - **Door Lock Failure:** Failure of the door lock actuators or switches, leading to difficulty locking or unlocking the doors. 
 - **Sunroof Leak:** Leaks around the sunroof, leading to water intrusion into the cabin. 

**Interior**
 - **Climate Control Issues:** Malfunctioning climate control system, resulting in insufficient heating or cooling, or erratic fan operation. 
 - **Seat Heater Failure:** Failure of the seat heater elements, leading to inoperative seat heaters. 
 - **Dashboard Squeaks and Rattles:** Excessive interior noises, such as squeaks and rattles, indicating loose components or poor assembly. 

**Summary**
The 2011 Saab 09-Mar offers a comfortable ride and sporty performance but is plagued by a significant number of reliability issues. The engine is prone to head gasket failure, turbocharger issues, and oil leaks, while the transmission suffers from premature clutch wear, shifting problems, and transmission slipping. The suspension also experiences premature failure of strut mounts and shock absorbers, leading to poor ride quality and handling. Additionally, various electrical glitches, exterior component failures, and interior issues further diminish the overall reliability of the vehicle. The severity and cost of these issues can be substantial, making the 09-Mar a risky choice for buyers seeking a dependable vehicle.
