**Introduction:**

The 2006 Saab 9-2X was a sport compact car that shared its platform with the Subaru Impreza. It was offered with a choice of either a 2.5L 4-cylinder or a 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, both of which could be paired with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5L engine produced 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, while the turbocharged 2.0L engine produced 227 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque. The 9-2X was praised for its handling, performance, and stylish design, but it was also criticized for its cramped interior and limited rear seat space.
