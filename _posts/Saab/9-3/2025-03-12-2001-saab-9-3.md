The base engine is a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4, producing around 185 horsepower and 194 lb-ft of torque. Higher trim levels offer a high output version of the same engine, tuned to around 205 horsepower. A 2.2L diesel engine was also offered in European markets. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Saab's distinctive design, comfortable ride, and surprising performance. Common complaints include electrical gremlins, difficulty finding parts, and the age-related reliability concerns typical of older European cars.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (B205E/B205R)**

* **Sludge Buildup**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Saab 2.0L turbo engines are prone to oil sludge buildup, especially if oil changes are neglected. This can lead to oil starvation, turbocharger failure, and eventually engine failure. Symptoms include oil pressure light, rough running, and unusual engine noises.
    * Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil are crucial. In severe cases, the oil pan may need to be removed and cleaned, and the oil pump and turbocharger inspected. An engine flush may help but is not always recommended due to the risk of dislodging large pieces of sludge.

* **Direct Ignition Cassette (DIC) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The DIC is responsible for firing the spark plugs. Failure can cause misfires, rough running, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the DIC unit with a new or known good unit. It is important to use a genuine Saab or reputable aftermarket brand DIC.
