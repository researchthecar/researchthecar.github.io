**Summary**

The 2010 Saab 9-3, while appreciated for its unique character, is prone to a range of issues typical of older European cars. The most concerning are engine-related problems like turbocharger and DIC failures, and transmission issues with the automatic variant. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SID and ABS module, can also be costly. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can run into the thousands of dollars, making pre-purchase inspection and diligent maintenance crucial. Severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical breakdowns.
