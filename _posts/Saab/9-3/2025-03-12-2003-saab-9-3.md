The 2003 Saab 9-3 marked a significant redesign from previous generations and moved to a GM Epsilon platform. Engine options included a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4, available in multiple states of tune. The base model produced around 150 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Higher trim levels offered versions with around 175 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque, while the Aero (formerly Viggen) model boasted a high-output variant producing around 210 hp and 221 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praised the 9-3 for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and turbocharged performance, especially in the Aero trim. Common complaints centered around electrical gremlins, turbocharger issues, and the overall reliability compared to other vehicles in its class.
