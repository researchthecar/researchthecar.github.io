The 2011 Saab 9-3 is a compact executive car known for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and turbocharged engines. One of the more common engine options is the 2.0L Turbocharged inline-4, producing around 210 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included a 2.0T BioPower engine and a 2.8T V6 engine. Available transmissions are a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the 9-3's unique character and sporty handling, but some dislike its reliability issues and limited parts availability post-Saab's bankruptcy.

**Summary**

The 2011 Saab 9-3, while appreciated for its unique styling and driving dynamics, has some common issues. Engine problems, such as purge valve issues in the 2.0T and turbo failures in the 2.8T, can lead to moderate to high repair costs. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can also be expensive. Electrical problems, such as SID failures, are common. Suspension and rust issues also contribute to the overall maintenance burden. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, and costs can vary widely. Limited parts availability can further complicate and increase the expense of repairs.
