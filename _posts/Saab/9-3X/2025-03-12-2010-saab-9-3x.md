The 2010 Saab 9-3X is a unique vehicle that blends wagon practicality with a touch of off-road flair. It came standard with a turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 engine producing 210 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. This engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and the utility of its wagon body.
