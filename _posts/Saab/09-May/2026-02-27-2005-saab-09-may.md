### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Saab 9-3, while offering a unique driving experience, exhibits some common reliability concerns that potential buyers should be aware of. The turbocharged engines, particularly the 2.0L, can be prone to turbocharger issues and oil sludge if not maintained meticulously. The 2.8L V6 has reported timing chain tensioner problems. Automatic transmissions may face torque converter issues, and manual transmissions can experience clutch wear. Electrically, the Body Control Module is a known weak point, leading to various gremlins, and ignition coils can fail. Suspension bushings are also a common wear item. However, the exterior and interior generally hold up well, with the infotainment system being relatively trouble-free. Regular maintenance, especially oil changes with the correct specification oil, is crucial for mitigating engine-related problems.
