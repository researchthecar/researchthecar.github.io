### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Saab 9-3, while offering a distinctive driving experience, presents a mixed reliability profile. The Ecotec engines, particularly the turbocharged variants, can be susceptible to oil sludge issues if maintenance is neglected, and turbocharger failures are not uncommon. Automatic transmissions, especially the 5-speed unit, may develop problems with the torque converter or valve body over time. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and window regulator failures, are also reported. However, the exterior and interior generally hold up well, with no widespread critical issues. Regular maintenance, especially concerning oil changes and transmission fluid, is crucial for mitigating many of these potential problems.
