### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Saab 9-3, while offering a unique driving experience, presents a mixed reliability profile. Diesel variants are more prone to issues with the DPF and EGR systems, requiring attention. Petrol engines, particularly the turbocharged variants, can experience turbocharger problems and PCV system clogging. Automatic transmissions may develop solenoid issues, while manual gearboxes are generally robust. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and ignition coils, are not uncommon. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, and interior electronics, such as the HVAC resistor and SID display, are known to fail. Despite these potential issues, many 9-3s remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
