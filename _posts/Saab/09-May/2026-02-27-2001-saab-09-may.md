### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Saab 9-5, while offering a unique driving experience, presents a few key areas that warrant attention for potential buyers or current owners. The turbocharged engines, particularly the 2.0L and 2.3L variants, are susceptible to oil sludge buildup if maintenance is neglected, and PCV system issues can also arise. Automatic transmissions may experience torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, such as SID display failures and ignition switch issues, are also noted.

With diligent maintenance, especially regarding oil changes and PCV system checks, many of these potential issues can be mitigated, allowing for continued enjoyment of this distinctive vehicle.
