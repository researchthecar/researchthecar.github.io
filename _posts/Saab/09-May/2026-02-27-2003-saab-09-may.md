### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Saab 9-3, while offering a distinctive driving experience, presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to center around the turbocharger systems in the 2.0T engines, potential oil sludge buildup if maintenance is neglected, and specific transmission concerns, particularly with the automatic variants and the manual M32 gearbox. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or infotainment, can also arise. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also noted wear items. However, many of these issues are well-documented and can be addressed with proper maintenance and timely repairs. The manual transmissions and the exterior/interior generally fare better, with fewer widespread critical failures reported. Overall, a well-maintained 2003 9-3 can still be a rewarding car, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problem areas and factor in potential repair costs.
