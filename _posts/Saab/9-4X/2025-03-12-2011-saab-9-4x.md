The 2011 Saab 9-4X was a short-lived luxury crossover produced during Saab's final years. It came with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 3.0L V6 producing 265 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.8L V6 producing 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the 9-4X for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and available all-wheel drive. Common dislikes included its limited production run, potential parts availability issues, and the general uncertainty surrounding the Saab brand at the time.
