The 2016 Scion iM is a compact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, practicality, and standard features. It comes with a single engine option, a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 137 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the car's comfortable ride and spacious cargo area. Common complaints include lackluster acceleration and relatively uninspired styling.

**Engine**

**1.8L 2ZR-FAE**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between services. The rate of consumption can vary. Some report needing a quart every 1,000 - 2,000 miles.
    *   Solution: Initially, monitor oil levels and top off as needed. A leak-down test can help determine if the piston rings are the cause. If consumption is excessive and confirmed to be internal (not due to leaks), piston ring replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on the shop and extent of repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover gasket, visible around the edge of the valve cover. May also smell burning oil.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, jerking, or hesitation during acceleration. Whining noise. Complete transmission failure in some cases. Error codes related to transmission function.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of the issue (valve body, torque converter, etc.). In some cases, a fluid flush and reset of the transmission control module (TCM) may help. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Chain Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A whine or grinding noise from the transmission during acceleration, slipping or hesitant acceleration, and a general feeling of the transmission struggling to provide power to the wheels.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn or failed CVT chain. Requires specialized knowledge and tools to perform.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Scion iM, while generally reliable, has a few common issues to be aware of. The CVT transmission problems are the most significant, potentially leading to costly repairs. Excessive oil consumption and valve cover gasket leaks are other engine-related concerns to watch out for. Suspension and electrical issues are less frequent but still worth noting.
