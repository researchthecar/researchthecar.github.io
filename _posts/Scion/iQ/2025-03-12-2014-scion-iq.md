The 2014 Scion iQ is a quirky and compact city car known for its impressive maneuverability and fuel efficiency. It's powered by a 1.3L inline-4 engine producing 94 horsepower and 89 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise its easy parking and surprisingly spacious interior for its size, while some dislike its limited cargo capacity and slow acceleration.

**Engine**

**1.3L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. The severity varies, with some experiencing minimal consumption and others needing to add oil every few hundred miles.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and using the manufacturer-recommended oil viscosity. In severe cases, a mechanic can perform a leak-down test to determine if piston rings or valve seals are the cause and replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3000+ (depending on the source of consumption and if engine replacement is necessary)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**
*   **CVT Juddering/Shaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report juddering, shaking, or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at low speeds. This is often attributed to wear in the CVT.
    *   Solution: Performing a CVT fluid flush and refill can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, CVT replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500 for fluid flush, $3,000 - $5,000+ for CVT replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of rear shock absorbers leading to bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. Leaks are visible.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The small battery in the Scion iQ is prone to draining quickly, especially if the car sits for extended periods or if aftermarket accessories are installed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery with a higher-capacity AGM battery, checking for parasitic drains, or using a battery maintainer when the car is not in use.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for a new battery; $100+ for diagnosing and fixing parasitic drains.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the bulbs.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlights, drying them out, and resealing them to prevent moisture intrusion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per headlight (depending on if DIY or professional repair is required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Warning Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential problem with the airbag system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis using an OBD2 scanner to determine the specific fault code. Repair could involve replacing a faulty sensor, clock spring, or other airbag component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the faulty component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Scion iQ, while a fuel-efficient and maneuverable city car, has some common issues that prospective owners should be aware of. The most significant issues revolve around the CVT transmission and potential excessive oil consumption in the engine. Electrical problems like battery drain can also be a nuisance. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, CVT replacement can be a costly repair. It is important to have the car thoroughly inspected before purchase.
