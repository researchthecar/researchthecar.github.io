The 2013 Scion iQ is a microcar known for its nimble handling and fuel efficiency. It came equipped with a 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine producing 94 horsepower and 89 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate the iQ's ease of parking and maneuverability in urban environments, along with its unique styling. However, some dislike its limited cargo space, cramped rear seats, and relatively slow acceleration.
