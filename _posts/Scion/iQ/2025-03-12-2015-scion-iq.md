The 2015 Scion iQ is a subcompact car known for its impressive maneuverability and fuel efficiency, making it ideal for city driving. It comes equipped with a 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine producing 94 horsepower and 89 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate its small size for parking and its unique styling, while some find its limited cargo space and engine power to be drawbacks.

**Engine**

**1.3L Four-Cylinder Engine**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms can include the need to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles, blue exhaust smoke, and a persistent burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Start with a compression test and leak-down test to determine the source of the consumption. Depending on the results, possible solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or even the entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ depending on the issue and repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, check engine light illumination (often with codes related to misfires).
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the cause (spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors, etc.). Replacing faulty components is the common remedy.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slipping, delayed engagement, unusual noises (whining or grinding), and the transmission warning light illuminating on the dashboard. Complete failure may prevent the car from moving.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the CVT. Rebuilding is complex and requires specialized knowledge, so replacement is often preferred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car battery drains quickly, even when the car is not in use for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include faulty alternators, interior lights left on, or aftermarket accessories that are not properly installed. Repair or replace the offending component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Headlight Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: One or both headlights intermittently stop working, flicker, or are dimmer than usual.
    * Solution: Replacing the headlight bulbs, checking the headlight relay, or replacing the headlight assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

Owners should be aware of the potential for excessive oil consumption and pay close attention to any symptoms indicating transmission problems. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to significant repair expenses.
