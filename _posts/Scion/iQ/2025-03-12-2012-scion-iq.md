The 2012 Scion iQ is a subcompact car known for its impressive fuel efficiency and city-friendly maneuverability. It came equipped with a 1.3L Inline-4 engine producing 94 horsepower and 89 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate its small size for parking and its fuel economy, but some dislike the cramped interior and limited cargo space. Common complaints also revolve around the engine's performance on the highway, as it can feel underpowered, and the somewhat stiff ride quality.

**Engine**

**1.3L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the engine consuming more oil than expected, leading to the need for frequent oil top-offs. Symptoms include the low oil level warning light illuminating, engine knocking, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Check the oil level regularly and top off as needed. If the problem persists, a compression test and leak-down test can help determine the source of the oil consumption, potentially indicating worn piston rings or valve seals. Depending on the cause, the fix might involve replacing piston rings, valve seals, or even the entire engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (for oil top-offs), $1,000 - $5,000+ (for engine repairs or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine may exhibit a rough idle, especially when cold, and in some cases, can stall.
    * Solution: Clean the throttle body and Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF). Check for vacuum leaks. If the issue persists, inspect and potentially replace the spark plugs or ignition coils.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$100 (for throttle body/MAF cleaning), $100-$300 (for spark plugs and coils), $100 - $500 (for vacuum leak repair depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

* **Hesitation/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission may exhibit hesitation during acceleration or jerking when shifting between drive and reverse. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds.
    * Solution: First check the CVT fluid level and condition. A CVT fluid change might resolve the issue. If the problem continues, more extensive internal repairs may be needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 (for CVT fluid change), $1,500 - $4,000+ (for CVT repair or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CVT Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report complete CVT failure, leading to the inability to drive the vehicle.
    * Solution: Replacement of the CVT.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain quickly, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine.
    * Solution: Check the battery's condition and replace it if necessary. Inspect for parasitic draws by testing the current drain when the vehicle is off.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 (for battery replacement), $100-$500+ (for diagnosing and repairing parasitic draws)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Loose Gas Cap and Warning Light**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gas cap gets loose very easy, causing the check engine light to turn on
    * Solution: Replacing the gas cap or tightening it
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Sun Visor Sagging/Breaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sun visors can become loose and sag or break, especially at the hinge.
    * Solution: Replacement of the sun visor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$150
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Scion iQ has a few common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine issues such as excessive oil consumption and rough idling can lead to costly repairs. The CVT transmission is also prone to issues. Electrical problems, particularly battery drain, can be inconvenient. Interior issues like the sun visor sagging are typically inexpensive to fix. Overall, while the iQ is a fuel-efficient and city-friendly car, potential buyers should inspect the engine and transmission carefully and be prepared for potential repairs. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to costly repairs, so a thorough inspection and maintenance history review are essential.
