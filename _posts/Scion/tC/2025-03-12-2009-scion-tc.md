The 2009 Scion tC is a sporty coupe known for its reliability, affordability, and distinctive styling. It comes equipped with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 161 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the tC's comfortable ride, spacious hatchback design, and customizable features. Conversely, some common criticisms include its relatively simple interior, average fuel economy for its class, and the lack of a more powerful engine option.

**Engine**

**2.4L 2AZ-FE I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2AZ-FE engine, used in various Toyota models around this time, is known for potential excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust (especially upon startup), and a low oil level warning light.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Toyota addressed this issue with a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) and offered to replace the piston rings with an updated design. The most effective solution is often replacing the pistons and piston rings, which can be a costly repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Loose Gas Cap**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle displays a “Check Engine” light on the dashboard, which could potentially be caused by a loose gas cap.
    * Solution: Remove and reinstall the gas cap and ensure that it is tightened securely. After a couple of trips, the check engine light will turn off. If not, the next thing to do is buy a new gas cap.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $50
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or "jolt" when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes alleviate this issue. In more severe cases, internal transmission damage may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for fluid and filter; $2,000 - $4,000+ for rebuild/replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slippage, where the engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, can occur. This is often accompanied by delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid level check and a fluid/filter change. If the problem persists, internal damage to the clutches or other components is likely, necessitating a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for fluid and filter; $2,000 - $4,000+ for rebuild/replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps, can indicate worn strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts. It's often recommended to replace the struts themselves at the same time, as they may also be worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (for struts and mounts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear shock absorbers may develop leaks over time, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over uneven surfaces. Visual inspection may reveal oil residue on the shocks.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A failing oxygen sensor can cause a check engine light, reduced fuel economy, and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor. Usually, a diagnostic scan can pinpoint which sensor is failing (upstream or downstream).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clock Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clock spring, located in the steering column, can fail, leading to issues with the horn, airbag, and steering wheel controls. Symptoms may include the horn not working, the airbag warning light illuminating, or the steering wheel controls malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Replace the clock spring. This is an important safety component, so it's best to have it done by a qualified technician.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctions, including getting stuck open or closed, or making excessive noise during operation. These can be caused by a faulty motor, damaged tracks, or a lack of lubrication.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific issue (motor, tracks, switch). Lubricating the tracks can sometimes resolve minor problems. More significant issues may require component replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard material can be prone to cracking, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the dashboard. Dashboard covers are an alternative, less expensive solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (for a cover); $500 - $1500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver's Seat Wobble**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The driver's seat can develop a wobble or excessive movement, often caused by worn bushings or loose bolts in the seat frame.
    *   Solution: Tighten any loose bolts. If the bushings are worn, they need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Scion tC is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it can be subject to certain issues. The most significant concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine, which can be a costly repair. Other issues, such as sunroof malfunctions, electrical problems, and suspension wear, are more common with age and mileage. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be more costly, so a thorough inspection before purchasing is advisable.
