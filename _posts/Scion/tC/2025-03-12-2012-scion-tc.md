The 2012 Scion tC is a sporty coupe known for its affordability, reliability, and youthful styling. It came with a single engine option: a 2.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 180 horsepower and 173 lb-ft of torque. This engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and value. Common complaints include a somewhat basic interior and a relatively firm ride.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 (2AR-FE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This may manifest as the engine running rough, blue smoke from the exhaust, or low oil level warning lights.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine has been the solution. Regular oil level checks and using the recommended oil viscosity can help mitigate this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or jerky shifting, especially between gears. Delayed engagement when shifting from Park or Neutral into Drive or Reverse is another common symptom.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and refill may temporarily alleviate the symptoms. However, in more severe cases, replacement of valve body components or even a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.

**Summary**

The 2012 Scion tC generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but owners have reported some common issues. The most concerning and potentially costly issues revolve around excessive oil consumption in the engine and harsh shifting in the automatic transmission. Suspension noises and electrical glitches with the radio and bluetooth are also relatively common. While these issues shouldn't necessarily deter a prospective buyer, it's important to be aware of them and to thoroughly inspect any used tC for these symptoms before purchase. Repair costs can range from relatively minor to substantial, depending on the specific problem and the chosen solution.
