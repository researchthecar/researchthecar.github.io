The 2008 Scion tC is a sporty, front-wheel-drive coupe known for its reliability and affordability. It came equipped with a single engine option: a 2.4-liter inline-four (2AZ-FE) producing 161 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the tC for its stylish design, comfortable front seats, and ample cargo space thanks to its hatchback design. Common complaints typically revolve around the lack of rear passenger space, somewhat bland interior materials, and at times, a harsher ride quality due to the sporty suspension.

**Summary:**

The 2008 Scion tC, while generally reliable, has some common issues owners should be aware of. The most significant issues revolve around engine oil consumption and potential transmission problems, particularly in the automatic version, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues like power windows and door locks are also relatively common. While the sunroof issue exists, it is mainly attributed to maintenance and lubrication. The suspension issues tend to be less costly than the engine and transmission issues. When shopping for a 2008 tC, it is essential to check the oil level, test the transmission thoroughly, and listen for any unusual noises from the suspension.
