**Introduction to the 2007 Scion tC**

The 2007 Scion tC is a sporty coupe that offers a blend of style and affordability. It was powered by a 2.4-liter inline-four engine that produced 161 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission. The tC was praised for its handling and its spacious interior, but it was also criticized for its lack of premium features and low fuel efficiency.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-Four**

* **Engine Failure:** Premature engine failure due to faulty piston rings. Symptoms include excessive oil consumption, blue exhaust smoke, and knocking noises. Solution: Engine replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to skip and potentially damage the engine. Symptoms include a clicking or rattling noise from the engine. Solution: Timing chain and tensioner replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000
* **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure:** The oil pressure sensor can fail, leading to inaccurate oil pressure readings. This can result in insufficient oil flow to the engine, potentially causing damage. Solution: Oil pressure sensor replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
* **EGR Valve Failure:** The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged or fail, leading to reduced engine performance and increased emissions. Solution: EGR valve replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** The intake manifold gasket can develop a leak, causing a vacuum leak and engine performance issues. Symptoms include rough idling, stalling, and decreased fuel efficiency. Solution: Intake manifold gasket replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500

**Transmission**

**Five-Speed Manual**

* **Shifting Problems:** Difficulty shifting gears or grinding noises when shifting. Solution: Transmission fluid change or clutch replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+

**Four-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slipping:** The transmission may slip or shudder when shifting gears. Solution: Transmission fluid change or transmission rebuild. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $2,000+
