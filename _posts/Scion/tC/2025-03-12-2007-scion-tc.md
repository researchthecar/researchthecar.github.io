The 2007 Scion tC is a sporty and affordable coupe known for its sleek styling and decent performance. It came standard with a 2.4L inline-4 engine (2AZ-FE) producing 161 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the tC's sporty appearance, comfortable front seats, and customization options. Common complaints included road noise, a somewhat harsh ride, and the dated 4-speed automatic transmission option.
