*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust (in severe cases), and the need to add oil more frequently than normal.
    *   Solution: A revised piston ring design addresses this issue in later model years (specifically 2015+). For earlier models, the repair usually involves replacing the piston rings. Some have had luck with heavier weight oil, but this is not a recommended fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump can fail prematurely, leading to coolant leaks, engine overheating, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a coolant leak near the water pump, an engine overheating warning light, and a whining noise from the engine.

    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild.

**Summary**

The 2011 Scion tC, while generally reliable, has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, which can lead to costly repairs. Other common issues include water pump failure, transmission problems, and various electrical glitches. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly.
