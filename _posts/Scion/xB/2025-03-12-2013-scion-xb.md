The 2013 Scion xB is a compact boxy wagon known for its spacious interior, unique styling, and Toyota reliability. It came with a single engine option, a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the xB's ample cargo space and ease of parking, while some find its fuel economy and driving dynamics to be less desirable.

**Engine**

**2.4L 2AZ-FE Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, particularly in higher mileage vehicles. This can manifest as needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, a burning oil smell, or blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: The most common solution is to replace the piston rings. In severe cases, the engine may need to be rebuilt or replaced. Switching to a higher viscosity oil may also temporarily help reduce oil consumption.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and repair method)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water pumps can fail over time, leading to coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include coolant leaks near the water pump, a whining noise from the engine, or the engine overheating.
    * Solution: Replace the water pump and thermostat.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing delayed or harsh shifting, particularly when shifting between gears. This can be caused by worn valve bodies, low transmission fluid, or internal component wear.
    * Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. In severe cases, a transmission replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Shocks Wearing Out Quickly**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear shocks on the Scion xB are known to wear out more quickly than expected, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially when carrying passengers or cargo in the back.
    * Solution: Replace the rear shocks with either OEM or aftermarket replacements. Consider upgrading to a heavier-duty shock absorber for improved durability.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (including labor)

* **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors can fail, triggering the TPMS warning light on the dashboard even when the tire pressure is correct.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty TPMS sensor. It may be necessary to reprogram the new sensor to the vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2013 Scion xB is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as excessive oil consumption, water pump failure, transmission issues, and premature wear of rear shocks. The headliner may also sag over time. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but addressing them promptly can help prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's reliability. Oil consumption and transmission issues can be the most expensive to address.
