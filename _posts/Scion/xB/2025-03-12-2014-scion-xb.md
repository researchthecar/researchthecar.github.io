The 2014 Scion xB is a compact, boxy wagon known for its spacious interior and quirky styling. It came with a single engine option, a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the xB's reliability and practicality but some dislike its relatively poor fuel economy and somewhat dated interior.
