The 2004 Scion xB is a compact, boxy wagon known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and unique styling. It came equipped with a single engine option, the 1.5-liter 1NZ-FE inline-4, producing 108 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the xB for its spacious interior, ample cargo room, and easy maneuverability. Common complaints include road noise, basic interior materials, and the relatively low power output, especially when fully loaded.

**Engine**

**1.5L 1NZ-FE Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-expected oil consumption, especially as the vehicle ages. This can manifest as needing to add oil between changes or noticing blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Regularly check oil levels and use the recommended oil type and viscosity. If consumption is excessive, inspect for leaks and consider a compression test to check for worn piston rings or valve seals. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil change with synthetic oil and oil consumption monitoring) - $3000+ (engine rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the timing chain tensioner. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup, and potential for engine damage if the chain skips.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting between gears, especially from 1st to 2nd, or experiencing harsh or jerky shifts. This is often more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change using the correct Toyota-specified fluid. If the issue persists, further diagnostics may be needed to check for valve body problems or worn solenoids. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 (fluid flush and filter change), $800-$2500+ (transmission rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, high engagement point.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Coil Spring Sag/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sitting lower than normal, especially when loaded. Can lead to a rougher ride and reduced handling. Broken coil springs can be a safety hazard.
    *   Solution: Replace both rear coil springs. Consider replacing shocks simultaneously.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window failing to go up or down, or operating intermittently. Often accompanied by a clicking sound from the motor.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Combination Meter (Instrument Cluster) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, or other instrument cluster components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the combination meter assembly. Refurbishment of the meter may also be an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in Areas with Road Salt)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the undercarriage, rocker panels, wheel wells, and other areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or replacement of affected panels. Prevention is key with rust inhibitors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaching from the backing and sagging down.
    *   Solution: Reupholster the headliner or replace the entire headliner assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Scion xB, while generally reliable, has some common issues owners should be aware of. Engine issues like oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failure can be costly to address. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic, can also arise. Suspension concerns, especially with rear coil springs, affect ride quality and safety. Electrical gremlins, such as power window motor and combination meter failures, are common and moderately priced. Rust is a significant concern in colder climates. Overall, addressing these issues can range from minor maintenance to substantial repairs, impacting the long-term cost of ownership.
