The 2011 Scion xB is a compact wagon known for its boxy styling, spacious interior, and reliability. Powered by a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine (2AZ-FE) producing 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, it offers decent performance for city and highway driving. The xB came with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the xB's cargo capacity, unique look, and Toyota-based reliability. Common complaints include the somewhat bland interior styling, road noise, and the older 4-speed automatic transmission can feel dated compared to more modern offerings.

**Summary**

The 2011 Scion xB is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it has its share of potential issues. The most concerning problems revolve around excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine and rough shifting in the 4-speed automatic transmission. While the oil consumption can be costly to repair, it is not always a guarantee, and many xBs run without this issue arising. Other issues such as suspension and electrical faults are relatively minor and less expensive to fix. The dashboard cracking is primarily a cosmetic issue, although it can affect the vehicle's resale value. Overall, prospective buyers should inspect the vehicle carefully for signs of these problems and factor in potential repair costs.
