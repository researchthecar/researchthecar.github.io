The 2015 Scion xB is a compact wagon known for its boxy design, spacious interior, and reliability. It came standard with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the xB for its practicality, ample cargo space, and unique styling. Common criticisms include its somewhat sluggish acceleration, dated interior design, and the availability of only one engine option which leads to lower fuel economy than its competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L 2AZ-FE Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or seeing blue smoke from the exhaust pipe, especially during start-up or acceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the piston rings are replaced to correct the oil consumption issue. A leak-down test can help diagnose the condition of the rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump can fail, leading to coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a visible coolant leak near the water pump, engine overheating, or a whining noise coming from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump. It is often recommended to replace the thermostat and drive belt at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (A245E)**
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between first and second gear. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds and may be accompanied by a clunking sound.
    *   Solution: Sometimes a transmission fluid change can alleviate the problem. In other cases, the valve body or solenoids may need to be replaced or rebuilt. A full transmission rebuild or replacement may be required in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (rebuild or replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips while accelerating, meaning the engine revs high, but the vehicle does not accelerate proportionally.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change might help, but slipping generally requires a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual (EC61)**
*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**
*   **Rear Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the rear suspension can sag, especially if the vehicle is frequently loaded with cargo. This can affect handling and ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shocks and/or coil springs. Upgrading to heavy-duty springs can help prevent future sagging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**
*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more of the power door locks may stop working, either failing to lock or unlock. This is often caused by a faulty door lock actuator.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Display Screen Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory radio or display screen may exhibit issues such as flickering, freezing, or complete failure.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof might have issues with opening, closing, or sealing properly, causing water leaks into the cabin.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, this could involve cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks, replacing the weather seals, or replacing the sunroof motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
