The 2008 Scion xB is a compact, boxy wagon known for its spacious interior, quirky styling, and Toyota reliability. It came equipped with a 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE inline-4 engine producing 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the xB's practicality, ample cargo space, and distinctive design. Some dislike its fuel economy compared to other compact cars, and the interior materials can feel somewhat basic.

**Summary**

The 2008 Scion xB, while generally reliable, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption, which can lead to costly repairs. Other issues, like the automatic transmission problems, power window failures, and rear hatch handle breakage, are also fairly prevalent and can add to the overall cost of ownership. While not all xBs will experience these problems, it's wise to have a pre-purchase inspection performed to identify any potential issues before buying. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing several thousand dollars.
