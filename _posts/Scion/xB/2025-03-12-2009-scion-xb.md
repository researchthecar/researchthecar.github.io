The 2009 Scion xB is a compact, boxy wagon known for its spacious interior and quirky styling. It came with one engine option, a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its cargo capacity, reliability, and unique design. Common complaints include the car's boxy shape leading to higher wind noise and the fuel economy not being as good as expected for a compact car.

**Summary**
The 2009 Scion xB is generally a reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues to be aware of. The most significant issues are excessive oil consumption in early production models and potential problems with the automatic transmission. Electrical issues such as power window and door lock actuator failures are also not uncommon. Suspension sagging and dashboard cracking are other concerns that buyers should inspect.
