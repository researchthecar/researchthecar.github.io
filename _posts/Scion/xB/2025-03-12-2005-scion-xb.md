The 2005 Scion xB is a quirky and practical compact wagon known for its boxy shape, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. It was originally sold with a 1.5L 1NZ-FE inline-four engine producing 108 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. The xB came with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the xB for its unique styling, ample cargo space, and reliability, while some dislike the somewhat basic interior and road noise.
