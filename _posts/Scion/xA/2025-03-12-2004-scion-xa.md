The 2004 Scion xA is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and surprisingly spacious interior for its size. It came equipped with a 1.5L 1NZ-FE inline-4 engine producing 103 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the xA for its reliability, practicality, and ease of parking. Common dislikes included its somewhat basic interior, limited power, and road noise.

**Engine**

**1.5L 1NZ-FE**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, particularly as the vehicle ages. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently between oil changes, blue exhaust smoke, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings is a common solution, but this is a labor-intensive repair. In some cases, replacing the engine with a used or remanufactured unit might be more cost-effective. Checking and replacing the PCV valve might also help in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (engine replacement), $800 - $2,500+ (piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oxygen sensors, particularly the upstream sensor (before the catalytic converter), can fail. Symptoms include poor fuel economy, rough idling, check engine light illumination with codes related to the oxygen sensor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Catalytic converters can fail, especially on higher mileage vehicles, leading to reduced engine performance, a rattling noise from underneath the car, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing delayed or harsh shifting, particularly when shifting between gears or when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush and filter change), $500 - $1500+ (valve body repair/replacement), $2,000 - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch wear is a normal occurrence, but some owners report premature clutch failure. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, and a high clutch pedal engagement point.
