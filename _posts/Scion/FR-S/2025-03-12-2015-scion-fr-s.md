The 2015 Scion FR-S is a rear-wheel-drive sports coupe known for its engaging driving dynamics and affordability. It's powered by a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed (boxer) four-cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. It comes with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the FR-S for its balanced handling, communicative steering, and overall fun-to-drive character. Criticisms commonly include its lack of low-end torque, relatively basic interior, and road noise.

**Engine**

**2.0L Boxer Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure warning light illuminating, and in severe cases, engine knocking or damage due to oil starvation. This issue seems to be more prevalent in early models and can worsen over time.
    *   Solution: A compression test can help diagnose the issue. In some cases, the short block may need replacement. Addressing any oil leaks (valve cover gasket, front crank seal, timing cover) can also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ (short block replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Failure (Potential)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Although not extremely common, some owners have reported valve spring failures leading to engine misfires or even complete engine failure. Symptoms can include a rough idle, engine knocking, or a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Valve spring replacement is necessary to rectify the problem. It's prudent to inspect other valve springs as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on severity and if it caused additional damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Reverse Gear Grinding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience difficulty engaging reverse gear, often accompanied by a grinding noise. This can occur when the clutch is fully depressed.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the clutch cable may help. Replacing the clutch, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing are other potential solutions, as is the replacement of the transmission itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (clutch cable adjustment), $1,200 - $2,500+ (clutch replacement), $2,000 - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds. The transmission may hesitate or "clunk" when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may help in some cases. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal transmission damage may be present, necessitating repairs or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (transmission fluid flush), $1,000 - $2,000+ (valve body repair), $3,000 - $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the rear suspension sagging over time, leading to a noticeable reduction in ride height and potentially affecting handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shocks and springs is the typical solution. Upgrading to aftermarket components may improve performance and durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the car is left unattended for extended periods. This can result in the car failing to start.
    *   Solution: Testing the battery and charging system is the first step. A parasitic draw test can identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (battery replacement), $100 - $500+ (parasitic draw diagnosis and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Unit Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory head unit can experience issues like freezing, crashing, or failing to connect to Bluetooth devices.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update), $200 - $800+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Fuel Door Spring**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel door spring can break, causing the fuel door to hang open.
    *   Solution: Replacing the fuel door spring mechanism.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the dashboard developing cracks, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard. This is an expensive fix. Using a sunshade can help prevent this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Scion FR-S offers an engaging driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The most concerning problem is excessive oil consumption, which can lead to expensive engine repairs. Other issues, such as reverse gear grinding and electrical problems, are less severe but still require attention. Overall, a thorough pre-purchase inspection is recommended, paying close attention to engine health and any signs of transmission issues.
