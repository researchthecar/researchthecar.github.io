The 2016 Scion FR-S is a sporty, rear-wheel-drive coupe known for its engaging handling and affordable price point. It's powered by a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder boxer engine producing 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. The FR-S came with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car's balanced chassis, communicative steering, and fun-to-drive nature. Common complaints include a lack of low-end torque, road noise, and a somewhat basic interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Boxer Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the engine consuming more oil than expected, requiring frequent top-offs. This is sometimes noticed after spirited driving. Blue smoke from the exhaust can also be a symptom.
    *   Solution: The updated 2017+ engines have improved piston rings to address this issue. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the severity. In some cases, replacing the piston rings or even the engine may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (engine replacement). Piston ring replacement can be cheaper, but still a significant expense.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A small number of 2013 models exhibited a valve spring issue that could potentially lead to engine failure. Symptoms might include a check engine light, rough running, and misfires.
    *   Solution: While this was more prevalent on earlier models, it's wise to have the valve springs inspected if there's any indication of a problem. The fix involves replacing the affected valve springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and the shop).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Grinding/Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly 2nd and 3rd, especially when the transmission is cold. Grinding noises may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid with a higher-quality synthetic fluid can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, the synchronizers may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $1,500+ (synchronizer replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or jerky shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop may also occur.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and refill with the correct Toyota WS fluid can sometimes resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $2,500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shocks Leaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The OEM rear shocks can sometimes start leaking prematurely. This can lead to a bouncy ride, reduced handling performance, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking rear shocks. Many owners upgrade to aftermarket performance shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the replacement shocks chosen and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Airbag Light On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system.
    *   Solution: The vehicle needs to be scanned to determine what is causing the light to be on. A faulty sensor, wiring harness, or even the airbag itself could be the issue. The fix will depend on the diagnosis.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component that needs to be repaired or replaced)
    *   Recalls: **Recall H0Z** (Takata Airbag Inflator Recall)

**Exterior**

*   **Tail Light Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the tail light housings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the tail light gasket can potentially fix this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+ (depending on part and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2016 Scion FR-S is generally a reliable sports car, but some common issues exist. Excessive oil consumption on the 2.0L engine is perhaps the most concerning, with potential for costly repairs. Transmission issues, while not as prevalent, can also be a source of frustration. Other issues like leaking shocks and tail light condensation are generally less severe and costly to address. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect any used FR-S before purchase.
