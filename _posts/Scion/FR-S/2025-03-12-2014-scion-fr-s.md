The 2014 Scion FR-S is a rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its engaging driving dynamics and affordable price point. It features a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated horizontally-opposed (boxer) four-cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the FR-S for its handling, steering feel, and lightweight design, making it a fun car to drive on twisty roads. Common complaints include the engine's lack of low-end torque and the relatively basic interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L FA20 Boxer Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported high oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil light illuminating or noticing a significant drop in the oil level on the dipstick. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present in severe cases.
    *   Solution: A leak-down test can help determine the source of oil consumption. Replacing piston rings or even the entire short block may be necessary if the issue is due to internal engine wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported valve spring failure. This can be identified by engine misfires, rough idling, and/or a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the affected valve springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Throwout Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squealing or grinding noise when the clutch pedal is depressed. Difficulty shifting into gear, especially first and reverse.
    *   Solution: Replace the throwout bearing. It is generally recommended to replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and pilot bearing at the same time, as it requires significant labor to access the throwout bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delays when shifting gears, or harsh "clunking" shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required, potentially including valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $150 - $300, Valve body replacement $800 - $2,000, Rebuild $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the rear shock absorbers. Bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. Reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car's battery drains quickly, especially if left sitting for a few days. Difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws in the electrical system. Potential culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator. A new battery may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Unit Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory head unit may experience issues such as freezing, not powering on, or having trouble connecting to Bluetooth.
    *   Solution: Replacing the head unit with an aftermarket or OEM unit is typically the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tail Light Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation buildup inside the tail light housings.
    *   Solution: Remove the tail lights and dry them out thoroughly. Check for cracks or damage and seal them properly. If the problem persists, the tail lights may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Rattles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises coming from the dashboard, particularly around the center console or instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and use foam padding or shims to dampen the vibrations.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Scion FR-S, while generally reliable, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The excessive oil consumption in the engine can be a significant concern, with potentially high repair costs. Throwout bearing failure in the manual transmission and delayed shifting in the automatic are also worth noting. Other issues, such as suspension leaks, electrical problems, and interior rattles, are generally less severe and less costly to address. Overall, a thorough inspection of the engine, transmission, and suspension is recommended before purchasing a used 2014 FR-S.
