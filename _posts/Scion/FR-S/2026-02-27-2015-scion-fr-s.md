### Overview
The 2015 Scion FR-S, a joint venture with Subaru, is a rear-wheel-drive sports coupe celebrated for its agile handling and driver-focused experience. Powered by a naturally aspirated boxer engine, it offers an engaging driving dynamic rather than outright power. Reliability for the 2015 model year is generally considered good, with owners reporting fewer significant mechanical problems compared to some competitors in its class. Common areas of attention tend to be minor, with the majority of the vehicle performing as expected for its age and mileage. However, like any performance-oriented vehicle, specific components may require more diligent maintenance or occasional attention.
