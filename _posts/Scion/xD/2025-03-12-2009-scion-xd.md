The 2009 Scion xD is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and distinctive styling. It came equipped with a 1.8-liter 2ZR-FE inline-4 engine producing 128 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the xD's nimble handling, spacious interior for its class, and Toyota's reputation for dependability. However, some criticisms include the somewhat basic interior and the lack of a more powerful engine option.

**Engine**

**1.8L 2ZR-FE Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This may be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings may resolve the issue. Monitoring oil levels regularly and using a thicker grade of oil can also help mitigate the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump may fail prematurely, leading to coolant leaks and potential engine overheating. Signs include a coolant leak near the water pump, a whining noise from the engine bay, and/or the engine temperature gauge reading higher than normal.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump with a new or remanufactured unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. Delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse can also occur.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may help. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild, may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 (fluid flush), $800 - $3,000+ (valve body/rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can present as shuddering during acceleration or a stall when coming to a stop.
    * Solution: Torque converter replacement is required to resolve this issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**
No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the rear shock absorbers can lead to a bouncy ride, reduced handling stability, and unusual tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensor failure can trigger the check engine light and result in reduced fuel efficiency, poor engine performance, and potential catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of one or more ABS sensors can trigger the ABS warning light and disable the anti-lock braking system. This can affect braking performance, particularly in slippery conditions.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ABS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners in areas that use road salt report rust formation especially around the rear wheel arches and undercarriage.
    * Solution: Rust repair to the affected panels. Prevention methods include washing the car regularly, and applying rust proofing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1,000+ per panel
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracking in the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight and high temperatures.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Scion xD is generally considered a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it has its share of potential issues. Engine issues such as excessive oil consumption and water pump failure can be moderately expensive to repair. Transmission problems, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, can also be costly. Other issues like suspension component wear and electrical sensor failures are typically less expensive to address. Overall, the severity of the reported issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially significant repair costs, so prospective buyers should be aware of these common problems and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
