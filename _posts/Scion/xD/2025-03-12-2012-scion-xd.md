The 2012 Scion xD is a subcompact hatchback known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It comes with a single engine option, a 1.8L inline-4 producing 128 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the xD's spacious interior, nimble handling, and Toyota-derived build quality. Common complaints include the somewhat dated 4-speed automatic transmission, which impacts fuel economy and acceleration, and the basic interior design.

**Engine**

**1.8L 2ZR-FE Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored closely. Blue smoke from the exhaust is a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and using the recommended oil type and viscosity are important. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic may need to perform a leak-down test to diagnose the cause. Possible fixes include replacing valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the severity and required repairs
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Leaking coolant, overheating, or a whining noise from the engine bay could indicate a failing water pump.
    * Solution: Replace the water pump. It is often recommended to replace the timing chain at the same time, as they are interconnected.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears. This can be more pronounced as the car ages.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, a mechanic should inspect the transmission for internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for fluid flush, $800 - $3000+ for more extensive repairs
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and tear of the rear shock absorbers can lead to a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and increased noise from the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A faulty oxygen sensor can cause the check engine light to illuminate, reduced fuel economy, and rough engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor (either upstream or downstream).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to an 02 sensor, this can cause a Check Engine Light as well as poor idle, reduced fuel economy, and engine hesistation.
    *   Solution: Replace the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the undercarriage, especially in areas where road salt is used.
    * Solution: Applying rust-proofing or undercoating to the undercarriage. Severe rust damage may require professional repair or replacement of affected parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the severity and location
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: In hot climates, some owners have reported cracking on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replacing the dashboard can be expensive. Aftermarket dash covers are a more affordable alternative.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1,000+ depending on the selected solution.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver's Seat Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The driver's seat can lose its form and sag over time, making it uncomfortable.
    *   Solution: Replace the seat or add support to the existing seat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Scion xD is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as excessive oil consumption, water pump failure, harsh shifting with the automatic transmission, rear shock absorber wear, and possible dashboard cracking. The severity of these issues varies, and the cost to fix them can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Regular maintenance and timely repairs can help prevent these problems and extend the life of the vehicle.
