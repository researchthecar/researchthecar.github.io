The 2010 Scion xD is a subcompact hatchback known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It came with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine (128 horsepower, 125 lb-ft of torque) paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its nimble handling, spacious interior for its size, and Toyota reliability. Some common complaints include the car's relatively basic features, unremarkable styling, and the 4-speed automatic transmission feeling outdated compared to competitors.
