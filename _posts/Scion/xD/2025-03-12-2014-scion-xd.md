The 2014 Scion xD is a subcompact hatchback known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior relative to its size. It comes equipped with a 1.8-liter inline-4 engine producing 128 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. It was offered with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its ease of parking, good gas mileage, and Toyota-based dependability, but some find the styling bland and the 4-speed automatic lacking in modern refinement.
