The 2008 Scion xD is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and youthful styling. It came with a 1.8-liter inline-4 engine (2ZR-FE) producing 128 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the xD's practicality, affordability, and Toyota-derived dependability. Common dislikes include its somewhat bland interior, limited cargo space, and basic features compared to newer models.
