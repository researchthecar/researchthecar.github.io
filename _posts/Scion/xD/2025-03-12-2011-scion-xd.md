The 2011 Scion xD is a subcompact hatchback known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It came with a single engine option: a 1.8-liter inline-4 (2ZR-FE) producing 128 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise its nimble handling, spacious interior for its size, and Toyota reliability. Common dislikes include its somewhat basic interior, limited rear passenger space, and the outdated 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**1.8L 2ZR-FE Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be indicated by blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: A temporary fix is to monitor and add oil as needed. The permanent fix often involves replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump may leak coolant, leading to overheating. Symptoms include coolant leaks under the vehicle, rising temperature gauge, and potential engine damage if left unattended.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump. It is often recommended to replace the serpentine belt and coolant at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between gears. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds or during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, it could indicate internal wear or damage requiring more extensive repairs or a transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush & filter); $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**
* **Clutch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and unusual noises when pressing the clutch pedal.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing. Resurfacing or replacing the flywheel may also be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and leaking shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and potential instability.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers. It's recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) illumination, poor fuel economy, rough idling, and potential catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor. There are usually multiple O2 sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Loose Gas Cap**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a very common problem. The gas cap is not always tightened after refueling, and it doesn't take very long for the check engine light to come on as a result.
    *   Solution: Remove and retighten the gas cap. Drive for a few days to see if the check engine light turns off. If the gas cap will not tighten, try replacing the gas cap.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Free; $20 - $50+ for a replacement gas cap.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blows warm air, making it ineffective for cooling. This can be accompanied by unusual noises from the compressor.
    *   Solution: Replace the AC compressor, dryer and expansion valve. It is also advised to flush the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600-$1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Scion xD is generally a reliable vehicle, but some common issues can arise. The most notable are related to oil consumption with the 1.8L engine and potential problems with the automatic transmission. Suspension and electrical issues, such as shock absorber wear and oxygen sensor failure, are also possible. The severity of these issues varies, with some requiring relatively inexpensive fixes, while others can be more costly, particularly engine or transmission repairs. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and prevent further damage.
