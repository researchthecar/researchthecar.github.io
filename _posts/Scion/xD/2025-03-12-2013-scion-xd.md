The 2013 Scion xD is a subcompact hatchback known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and surprisingly spacious interior for its size. It came standard with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 128 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its nimble handling, ease of parking, and Toyota-derived build quality. Common complaints include the somewhat basic interior materials, the dated 4-speed automatic transmission, and limited availability of advanced features compared to newer vehicles.
