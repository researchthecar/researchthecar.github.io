The 2012 Fisker Karma is a unique plug-in hybrid luxury sports sedan that blended striking design with electric vehicle technology. Its powertrain consists of a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline engine, sourced from General Motors, that acts as a generator to power the electric motors. The Karma boasts a combined output of 403 horsepower and a substantial 981 lb-ft of torque from its dual electric motors. What people appreciated about the Karma was its distinctive styling, eco-friendly image, and quick acceleration in electric mode. Common complaints revolved around its reliability issues, software glitches, and limited range compared to fully electric vehicles. The gas engine was primarily there to charge the battery, meaning it was rarely used.
