### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Oldsmobile Alero, while offering a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy for its time, exhibits several common reliability concerns. The most frequently reported issues revolve around the engine's intake manifold gaskets (especially on the 2.4L and 3.4L engines), potential head gasket failures on the V6, and transmission problems with the 4T40-E automatic, such as harsh shifting and torque converter issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Body Control Module and window regulators, are also notable. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear out, leading to handling and noise problems. Exterior rust, especially in common areas, and interior HVAC blend door failures are also points to consider. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and prioritize vehicles with well-maintained histories.
