The 2004 Oldsmobile Alero was a popular compact car known for its sporty styling and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec Inline-4 producing 140 hp and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4L LA1 V6 delivering 170 hp and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 4T40-E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Alero's sleek design and decent fuel economy, but common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with electrical components and some engine-related problems.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may run rough, misfire, or exhibit poor fuel economy. A vacuum leak may be audible.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminates (typically with codes P0420), reduced engine performance, and a sulfur smell from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**3.4L LA1 V6**

*   **Lower Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak (often external, but can leak into the oil), overheating, white smoke from exhaust, "milky" oil, rough running.
    *   Solution: Replace the lower intake manifold gasket. This is a common issue with this engine and often requires updated gasket design to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, poor fuel economy, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per injector

**Transmission**

**4T40-E 4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, failure to shift into certain gears, transmission slipping. Check engine light may be on with transmission-related codes.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoid(s). May also involve replacing the transmission filter and fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, poor acceleration, and/or unusual noises from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ (often involves removing and reinstalling the transmission)

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can also affect steering feel.
    *   Solution: Replace the front strut mounts. May also require replacing the struts themselves if they are worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side

*   **Rear Coil Spring Sag/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower in the rear, especially when loaded. Can cause a bouncy ride and affect handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ for the pair

**Electrical**

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as malfunctioning power windows, door locks, lights, or security system. Can also cause starting problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and reprogram or replace the BCM. Requires specialized tools and expertise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

*   **Ignition Switch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the car, stalling while driving, loss of electrical power to certain systems.
    *   Solution: Replace the ignition switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exterior door handles (especially on the driver's side) are prone to breaking, making it difficult to open the doors.

**Summary**

The 2004 Oldsmobile Alero is prone to a variety of issues, ranging from moderate to severe. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine (intake manifold gaskets being a primary culprit) and transmission (shift solenoids and torque converter issues), which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical problems, particularly with the BCM, are also common and can be challenging to diagnose. Suspension components and exterior door handles are also known failure points. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can quickly escalate into significant expenses. The recalls should be addressed for safety reasons. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and obtain a pre-purchase inspection to assess the overall condition of the vehicle.
