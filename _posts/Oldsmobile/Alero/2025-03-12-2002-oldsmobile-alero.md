The 2002 Oldsmobile Alero was a mid-size car offering a mix of style and practicality. Engine options included a 2.2L inline-4 and a 3.4L V6. The 2.2L produced around 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.4L offered approximately 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Alero's sporty styling and comfortable ride, but common complaints centered around reliability issues, particularly with electrical components and some engine/transmission issues.
