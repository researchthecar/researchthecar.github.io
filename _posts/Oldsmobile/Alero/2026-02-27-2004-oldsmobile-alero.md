# 2004 Oldsmobile Alero

### Overview
The 2004 Oldsmobile Alero, a compact car from a brand that was discontinued shortly after, presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. While it offered a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy for its time, certain mechanical and electrical components are known to be prone to issues. Owners often report problems related to the engine, particularly with specific powertrain configurations, and the electrical system can be a source of frustration. Suspension components also show wear over time, as is common with vehicles of this age. However, the interior and exterior generally hold up reasonably well, with issues typically stemming from age rather than inherent design flaws. Careful maintenance and addressing common problems proactively are key to keeping a 2004 Alero on the road.

### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Oldsmobile Alero is a vehicle that requires attention to its common weak points to maintain reliability. The engines, particularly the 3.4L, can be prone to significant issues like head gasket failure, while both engine options can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks. Automatic transmissions, specifically the 4T40-E and 4T45-E, may develop slipping issues or torque converter problems. The electrical system is a notable concern, with the Body Control Module and alternators being common failure points. Suspension components like struts and ball joints will likely need replacement due to age and mileage. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, owners should be prepared for potential repairs, especially concerning the powertrain and electrical systems. Regular maintenance and prompt addressing of early symptoms are crucial for longevity.
