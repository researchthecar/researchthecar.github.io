**Introduction:**

The 1993 Oldsmobile 98 is a full-size luxury sedan that was lauded for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful V8 engine options. However, like most vehicles, it has encountered some issues over the years.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Warped or cracked gaskets cause coolant and oil leaks, rough idling, and poor performance. Replaced with a new gasket. **$300 - $600+**
* **Head Gasket Failure:** Blown head gaskets lead to overheating, oil contamination, and excessive exhaust smoke. Replaced with new head gaskets. **$1,200 - $2,000+**

**4.9L V8**

* **Throttle Position Sensor Malfunction:** Faulty sensor causes engine hesitation, rough idling, and decreased power. Replaced with a new sensor. **$150 - $300+**
* **Fuel Injector Failure:** Clogged or leaky injectors lead to poor fuel delivery, resulting in misfiring, rough running, and decreased fuel economy. Replaced with new injectors. **$200 - $500+**

**5.7L V8**

* **Intake Manifold Bolt Failure:** Loose intake manifold bolts can cause vacuum leaks, affecting engine performance and fuel economy. Bolts tightened or replaced. **$100 - $300+**
* **Oil Pressure Switch Malfunction:** Failed switch triggers an incorrect low oil pressure warning, even when oil levels are sufficient. Replaced with a new switch. **$50 - $200+**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4T60-E)**

* **Transmission Slipping:** Worn or damaged clutches or bands cause the transmission to slip gears, leading to loss of power and erratic shifting. Overhauled or rebuilt transmission. **$1,500 - $3,000+**
* **Torque Converter Failure:** Damaged torque converter can cause shuddering, slipping, and overheating. Replaced with a new converter. **$800 - $1,500+**
