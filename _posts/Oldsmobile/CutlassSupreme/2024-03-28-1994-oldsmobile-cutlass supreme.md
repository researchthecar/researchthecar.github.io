**Summary**

Overall, the 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme is a reliable vehicle with a few common issues. The engine is generally robust, but the intake manifold gasket and head gasket can fail. The transmission is also reliable, but slipping and torque converter failure can occur. Suspension issues include front suspension noise and rear suspension sagging. Electrical problems such as power window failure and alternator failure can also arise. Exterior issues include trunk lid rust and plastic trim fading. Interior rattles and A/C compressor failure are also potential problems. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but they are generally not catastrophic.
