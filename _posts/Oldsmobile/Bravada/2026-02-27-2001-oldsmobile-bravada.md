### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Oldsmobile Bravada, while offering a comfortable ride and standard AWD, presents a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. The 4.2L Atlas inline-six engine is generally robust but can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and oil cooler line issues. The 4L60-E transmission is a known quantity, with torque converter clutch and solenoid problems being the most common concerns. Suspension components, particularly the air suspension system if equipped, can be a source of expense. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or instrument cluster, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be an issue on older models, and interior wear on upholstery is typical for its age. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, potential owners should be aware of these specific areas and budget for potential repairs.
