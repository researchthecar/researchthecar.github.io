### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada offers a comfortable and relatively luxurious experience for its era, but potential buyers should be aware of common reliability concerns. The 4.2L Atlas engine, while generally robust, can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and oil cooler line issues. The 4L60-E transmission is prone to torque converter clutch problems and solenoid failures, which can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension components like ball joints and the optional air suspension system can also require attention. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and ignition switch, are not uncommon and can manifest as frustrating intermittent problems. While not a universally problematic vehicle, addressing these known weak points proactively can help ensure a more reliable ownership experience.
