It came standard with the 4.3L Vortec V6 engine producing 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Bravada for its smooth ride and all-weather capability, but common complaints included mediocre fuel economy and some reliability concerns, particularly with age.

**Engine**

**4.3L Vortec V6**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks often occur at the intake manifold gasket. Symptoms include a sweet smell, low coolant levels, and potential overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gasket with an updated design is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "spider" fuel injector assembly (poppet valve design) is prone to failure. Symptoms include rough running, poor fuel economy, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel injector assembly with either an updated multi-port fuel injection system or a new spider injector assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per location
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Hard Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifting, or failure to shift. This can be due to worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution can range from a fluid flush and filter change to a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, stalling, or unusual noises coming from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear air suspension system (if equipped) is prone to leaks in the air lines or failure of the air compressor. This results in the rear of the vehicle sagging or failing to level.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air lines, air springs, or the air compressor. Many owners opt to convert to a coil spring setup to eliminate these issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per component or $500 - $1000+ for coil spring conversion
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or humming noise coming from the wheels, particularly when turning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of blower motor function on certain speeds, or complete failure of the blower motor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic readings or complete failure of gauges in the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is common, especially in areas with road salt. Common areas include the rocker panels, lower doors, and around the wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200+ per area depending on severity

**Interior**

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of power windows or door locks, often due to worn switches or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty switch or repair of the wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per door

**Summary**

The 2001 Oldsmobile Bravada, while offering a comfortable ride and all-wheel-drive capability, suffers from several common issues as it ages. Engine and transmission problems, particularly related to gaskets, fuel injectors, and transmission wear, can be costly to address. Suspension issues, especially with the air suspension, are also prevalent. Electrical and interior problems, such as blower motor resistor failures and instrument cluster issues, add to the list of potential headaches. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine or transmission rebuilds, can be quite costly, making careful inspection and maintenance essential for owners.
