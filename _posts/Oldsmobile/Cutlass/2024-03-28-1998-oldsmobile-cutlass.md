**Introduction**

The 1998 Oldsmobile Cutlass was a popular midsize sedan that offered a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. It was available with three engine options: a 3.1-liter V6, a 3.8-liter V6, and a 3.8-liter supercharged V6. The 3.1-liter V6 produced 160 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.8-liter V6 produced 190 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. The supercharged 3.8-liter V6 produced 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. All three engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

People who liked the Cutlass praised its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and powerful engines. However, some people found the Cutlass to be too large and unwieldy, and its fuel economy was not very good.
