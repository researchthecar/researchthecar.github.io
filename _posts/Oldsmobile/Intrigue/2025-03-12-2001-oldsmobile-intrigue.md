The 2001 Oldsmobile Intrigue was a mid-size sedan offering a blend of comfort and sporty handling. It was available with two engine options: a 3.5L "Shortstar" V6, producing 215 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L "Series II" V6, producing 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T65-E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Intrigue for its smooth ride, comfortable seats, and distinctive styling, while common criticisms included its somewhat dated interior, occasional reliability issues, and relatively low fuel economy compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2001 Oldsmobile Intrigue, while appreciated for its ride and styling, is prone to several issues as it ages. The most common and potentially expensive problems relate to engine intake manifold gasket failures (both engines) and transmission issues. Suspension and electrical problems are also frequently reported. Rust can be a significant issue, especially in areas with road salt. Owners should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into the cost of ownership. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, particularly transmission overhauls.
