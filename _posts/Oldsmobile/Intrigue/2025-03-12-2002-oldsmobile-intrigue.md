The 2002 Oldsmobile Intrigue was a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and decent performance. It came with two engine options: a 3.5L LX5 Shortstar V6 producing 215 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L L36 V6 generating 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciated its smooth ride and spacious interior, while others disliked its reliability issues and somewhat bland styling. Both engines were paired with the 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission.
