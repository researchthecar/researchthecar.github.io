**Introduction:** The 1992 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera is a mid-size sedan that was available with three engine options: a 3.3-liter V6, a 3.8-liter V6, and a 4.3-liter V8. The 3.3-liter V6 produced 160 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, the 3.8-liter V6 produced 170 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, and the 4.3-liter V8 produced 180 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. The 3.3-liter V6 was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.8-liter V6 and 4.3-liter V8 were paired with a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. The Cutlass Ciera was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordability. However, it was criticized for its lackluster performance and dated styling.

**Engine**

**3.3-liter V6**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak. This can lead to overheating, engine damage, and loss of power. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $300 - $500.
* **Head gasket failure:** The head gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak into the cylinders. This can lead to overheating, engine damage, and loss of power. The solution is to replace the head gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $800 - $1,200.

**3.8-liter V6**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak. This can lead to overheating, engine damage, and loss of power. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $300 - $500.
* **Valve cover gasket failure:** The valve cover gasket can fail, causing oil to leak. This can lead to a drop in oil pressure and engine damage. The solution is to replace the valve cover gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $100 - $200.

**4.3-liter V8**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak. This can lead to overheating, engine damage, and loss of power. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $300 - $500.
* **Head gasket failure:** The head gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak into the cylinders. This can lead to overheating, engine damage, and loss of power. The solution is to replace the head gasket. The estimated cost to fix is $800 - $1,200.

**Transmission**

**4-speed automatic transmission**

* **Transmission slippage:** The transmission may slip out of gear, causing a loss of power. This can be caused by a worn-out clutch pack or a failing solenoid. The solution is to replace the clutch pack or solenoid. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $1,000.

**5-speed manual transmission**

* **Gear grinding:** The gears may grind when shifting, especially when the transmission is cold. This can be caused by worn-out synchros or a failing shift fork. The solution is to replace the synchros or shift fork. The estimated cost to fix is $300 - $500.

**Suspension**

* **Strut failure:** The struts can fail, causing the vehicle to ride rough and handle poorly. The solution is to replace the struts. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $1,000.
* **Sway bar link failure:** The sway bar links can fail, causing the vehicle to roll excessively when cornering. The solution is to replace the sway bar links. The estimated cost to fix is $100 - $200.

**Electrical**

* **Starter failure:** The starter can fail, preventing the engine from starting. The solution is to replace the starter. The estimated cost to fix is $300 - $500.
* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, preventing the battery from charging. The solution is to replace the alternator. The estimated cost to fix is $300 - $500.

**Exterior**

* **Door lock failure:** The door locks may fail, preventing the doors from being opened or closed. The solution is to replace the door lock actuator. The estimated cost to fix is $100 - $200.
* **Headlight switch failure:** The headlight switch may fail, preventing the headlights from turning on. The solution is to replace the headlight switch. The estimated cost to fix is $100 - $200.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard cracking:** The dashboard may crack, especially in hot climates. The solution is to replace the dashboard. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $1,000.
* **Power window motor failure:** The power window motor may fail, preventing the windows from being opened or closed. The solution is to replace the power window motor. The estimated cost to fix is $200 - $300.

**Summary:** The 1992 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera is a reliable and affordable vehicle. However, it is prone to some common issues, including intake manifold gasket failure, head gasket failure, and transmission slippage. The severity of these issues ranges from minor to severe, and the cost to fix them can vary depending on the specific issue and the condition of the vehicle.
