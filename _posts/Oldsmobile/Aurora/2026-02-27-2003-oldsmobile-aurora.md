### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Oldsmobile Aurora, while offering a comfortable ride, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and platform. The V6 and V8 engines can experience issues like intake manifold leaks and head gasket failures, respectively, which can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, particularly with the torque converter and solenoids, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, can lead to frustrating intermittent issues. Suspension components like strut mounts and ball joints may require attention. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, specific component failures can occur. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and prioritize vehicles with well-maintained histories.
