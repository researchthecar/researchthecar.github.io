**Summary**
The 2003 Oldsmobile Aurora, while offering a comfortable and stylish ride, can suffer from several common issues. Engine oil and coolant leaks are prevalent, particularly in the V8 models. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting, can be expensive to repair. Suspension issues, especially with the rear air suspension (if equipped), can also arise. Electrical problems like dimming headlights and battery drain are also reported. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or air suspension overhauls, can be costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, budgeting for potential repairs.
