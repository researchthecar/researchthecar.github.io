**Introduction**

The 1999 Oldsmobile Aurora is a mid-size luxury sedan with a sophisticated design and powerful engine options. It was available with either a 3.5L V6 or a 4.0L V8 engine, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Despite its refined interior and exterior, the Aurora has been plagued by various issues that have affected its reliability and owner satisfaction.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, leading to coolant and oil leakage. Symptoms include coolant loss, engine overheating, and poor performance. Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $600+
* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure:** The camshaft position sensor can fail, causing the engine to run poorly or stall. Symptoms include engine misfiring, rough idle, and poor acceleration. Solution: Replace the camshaft position sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300+
* **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks:** The valve cover gaskets can leak oil, causing a burning smell and lowered oil levels. Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**4.0L V8**

* **Knock Sensor Failure:** The knock sensors can fail, causing the engine to ping or knock under load. Symptoms include engine knocking, poor performance, and reduced fuel economy. Solution: Replace the knock sensors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to become loose. Symptoms include engine noise, reduced power, and potential engine damage. Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner and timing chain. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1200+
* **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure:** The oil pressure sensor can fail, providing false readings. Symptoms include inaccurate oil pressure readings, warning lights, and potential engine damage. Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+

**Transmission**

* **4-Speed Automatic Transmission:**

* **Solenoid Pack Failure:** The solenoid pack can fail, causing shifting problems and transmission slippage. Symptoms include delayed or harsh shifting, inability to shift gears, and loss of power. Solution: Replace the solenoid pack. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
* **Transmission Filter Clogging:** The transmission filter can become clogged, restricting fluid flow and causing transmission problems. Symptoms include shifting delays, slipping gears, and overheating. Solution: Replace the transmission filter and fluid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $250+

**Suspension**

* **Front Control Arm Bushings:** The front control arm bushings can wear out, causing knocking noises and vibration. Symptoms include excessive tire wear, poor handling, and decreased ride comfort. Solution: Replace the control arm bushings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure:** The rear shock absorbers can fail, reducing ride quality and handling. Symptoms include excessive bouncing, poor stability, and increased braking distance. Solution: Replace the shock absorbers. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
* **Sway Bar Links:** The sway bar links can wear out or break, affecting handling and stability. Symptoms include excessive body roll, wandering steering, and clunking noises. Solution: Replace the sway bar links. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $250+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely due to a parasitic draw. Symptoms include a dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle, and electrical malfunctions. Solution: Diagnose and repair the cause of the parasitic draw. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to not charge properly. Symptoms include a dead battery, flickering lights, and electrical malfunctions. Solution: Replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
* **Headlight Switch Failure:** The headlight switch can fail, causing the headlights to not work properly. Symptoms include intermittent or non-functional headlights. Solution: Replace the headlight switch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+

**Exterior**

* **Windshield Leaks:** The windshield can leak water into the interior of the vehicle. Symptoms include water on the floor, fogging windows, and unpleasant odors. Solution: Reinstall or replace the windshield. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
* **Door Handle Failure:** The door handles can fail, making it difficult to enter or exit the vehicle. Symptoms include stuck or broken handles. Solution: Replace the door handles. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system can malfunction, causing improper heating or cooling. Symptoms include inconsistent temperatures, fan problems, and AC issues. Solution: Diagnose and repair the specific issue within the climate control system. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
* **Power Seat Failure:** The power seats can fail, making it difficult to adjust the seating position. Symptoms include non-functional seat adjustments or intermittent power. Solution: Repair or replace the power seat motors or switches. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Summary**

The 1999 Oldsmobile Aurora has a range of issues that can affect the engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and interior components. While some of these problems are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be more severe and costly. Overall, the reliability of the Aurora is subpar, and potential owners should be aware of the potential issues before purchasing a used model. Estimated repair costs for the more serious issues can range from $800 to $1200+.
