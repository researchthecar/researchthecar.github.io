The 2001 Oldsmobile Aurora was a mid-size luxury sedan known for its sleek styling and powerful engine options. Available engines included a 3.5L Shortstar V6 producing 215 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L L47 Aurora V8, a derivative of the Northstar engine, generating 250 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Aurora's comfortable ride and distinctive appearance, but disliked its age, fuel economy, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2001 Oldsmobile Aurora is prone to issues, especially considering its age. The most severe problems are related to the engine, particularly head gasket failures in the 4.0L V8, which can be very expensive to repair. Transmission issues are also relatively common and can lead to costly rebuilds. Suspension and electrical problems are less severe but still contribute to the overall ownership cost. Due to the age of the vehicle, finding parts and qualified technicians may also pose a challenge.
