### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Oldsmobile Aurora, while offering a comfortable and stylish experience, exhibits common issues for its age and platform. The V8 engine, in particular, can be prone to more significant repairs like timing chain and intake manifold gasket failures. The V6 shares intake manifold issues and can also face head gasket problems. Transmission reliability is generally fair, but torque converter and solenoid issues are noted. Suspension components like strut mounts and ball joints are typical wear items that may need attention. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, are also reported. Exterior paint degradation and interior climate control or power seat issues are also points to consider. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for managing the long-term reliability of this vehicle.
