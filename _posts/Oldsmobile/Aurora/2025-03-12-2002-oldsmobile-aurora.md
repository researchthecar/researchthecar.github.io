The 2002 Oldsmobile Aurora was a mid-size luxury sedan known for its sleek styling and powerful engine options. Two engine options were available: a 3.5L Shortstar V6 producing 215 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque and a 4.0L L47 Northstar V8 producing 250 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Aurora for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and distinctive appearance. Common complaints included issues with electrical components, particularly the climate control system, and the cost of repairs due to the vehicle's complexity.
