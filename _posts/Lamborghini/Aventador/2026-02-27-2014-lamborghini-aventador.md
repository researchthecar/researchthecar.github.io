### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Lamborghini Aventador is a complex supercar with a generally robust mechanical foundation. However, its high-performance nature and intricate systems mean that specific issues can arise, particularly concerning the automated manual transmission's clutch actuator and hydraulic system, as well as potential leaks in the cooling system and exhaust manifolds. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Exterior door mechanisms and interior climate control components can also require attention. While not indicative of widespread failure, these are areas where owners should be vigilant and prepared for potential repairs, which are typically costly due to the exotic nature of the vehicle.
