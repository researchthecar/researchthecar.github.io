## Engine

### 6.5L V12 Naturally Aspirated
**Cooling System Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Engine overheating, coolant smell, visible coolant puddles under the vehicle.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of hoses, seals, or radiator.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1,500

**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Low oil level warnings, blue smoke from exhaust, increased oil top-offs required.
- **Solution:** Engine inspection for worn piston rings or valve seals; potential rebuild.
- **Cost:** $3,000 - $8,000+


## Transmission

### ISR (Independent Shifting Rod) 7-Speed Automated Manual
**Clutch Actuator Malfunction**
- **Symptoms:** Difficulty shifting gears, jerky gear changes, transmission warning lights, failure to engage gears.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and replacement of the clutch actuator or related hydraulic components.
- **Cost:** $2,500 - $5,000

**Transmission Control Module (TCM) Errors**
- **Symptoms:** Erratic shifting behavior, limp mode engagement, transmission fault codes.

## Suspension

### Magnetorheological Dampers
**Damper Leaks/Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Harsh ride, excessive bouncing, suspension warning lights, fluid leaks from dampers.
- **Solution:** Replacement of faulty magnetorheological dampers.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $2,000 per damper


## Electrical

### Infotainment System
**Screen Freezing/Unresponsiveness**
- **Symptoms:** Infotainment screen becomes unresponsive, freezes, or restarts intermittently.
- **Solution:** Software update or replacement of the infotainment unit.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,000


### Battery Drain
**Parasitic Battery Drain**
- **Symptoms:** Battery dies unexpectedly, car won't start after short periods of inactivity.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis to identify parasitic draw from modules or accessories, repair or replacement of faulty components.
- **Cost:** $300 - $800


## Exterior

### Doors (Scissor Doors)

### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Lamborghini Aventador is a remarkable supercar with a generally strong reliability record for its class. While it is not immune to issues, the documented problems are typically related to its high-performance components and complex systems. Common areas of concern include potential leaks or excessive consumption in the 6.5L V12 engine, and occasional malfunctions with the ISR transmission's clutch actuators or TCM. The sophisticated suspension and electrical systems, while advanced, can also present specific failure points like damper leaks or infotainment glitches. Owners should anticipate higher maintenance costs and the possibility of specialized repairs, but for a vehicle of this caliber, the overall reliability is commendable, provided it is maintained by qualified technicians.
