# 2015 Lamborghini Aventador

### Overview
The 2015 Lamborghini Aventador, a pinnacle of Italian supercar engineering, generally exhibits strong mechanical reliability, befitting its exotic nature and price point. While not immune to the complexities inherent in high-performance vehicles, major widespread issues are infrequent. Owners can expect a robust powertrain and chassis, though the sophisticated electronic systems and specialized components require diligent maintenance. The focus for reliability data centers on potential anomalies in the advanced systems and the durability of exotic materials rather than common automotive wear and tear. This analysis aims to provide a clear picture of potential concerns for prospective and current owners.

### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Lamborghini Aventador is a remarkably reliable supercar, with its core V12 engine and chassis proving robust. The primary areas where owners might encounter issues are related to the complex automated manual transmission (ISR), particularly its clutch actuator and hydraulic systems, and the sophisticated electronic and active aerodynamic components. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted but not widespread. While repairs can be costly due to the exotic nature of the vehicle, proactive maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly can ensure continued high performance and reliability. Overall, it represents a solid, albeit high-maintenance, investment for the discerning enthusiast.
