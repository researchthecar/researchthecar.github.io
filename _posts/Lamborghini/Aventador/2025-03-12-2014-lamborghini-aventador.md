The 2014 Lamborghini Aventador is a mid-engine supercar known for its aggressive styling, powerful V12 engine, and exhilarating performance. The Aventador LP 700-4 is equipped with a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine producing 690 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed single-clutch automated manual transmission (ISR). The Aventador delivers blistering acceleration and a raw driving experience. Owners often praise the car's striking looks, impressive performance, and the distinctive V12 sound. However, some common criticisms include the harsh ride, the jerky nature of the single-clutch transmission at low speeds, and high maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**6.5L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various points on the engine, including valve covers, oil pan, and crankshaft seals. Symptoms include visible oil spots under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating can occur due to radiator leaks, faulty thermostats, or issues with the cooling fan. Symptoms include the temperature gauge rising to the red zone, steam emanating from under the hood, and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the faulty components, such as the radiator, thermostat, or cooling fan.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the affected component.

**Transmission**

**7-Speed ISR (Independent Shifting Rods)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ISR transmission is known for its abrupt shifts, especially at low speeds. This can lead to premature clutch wear. Symptoms include jerky acceleration, difficulty shifting smoothly, and a burning smell from the clutch.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes improve shift quality. Clutch replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update $300, Clutch replacement $8,000 - $15,000+

*   **Transmission Control Module (TCM) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TCM can fail, leading to issues such as the inability to shift gears, erratic shifting, or the transmission entering limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacing the TCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Lift System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The optional front-axle lift system can experience failures in the hydraulic pump or actuators. This can result in the front of the car becoming stuck in the raised or lowered position.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty pump or actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur, especially if the car is not driven regularly. This can lead to difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery, checking for parasitic drains, and using a battery tender when the car is not in use.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the car can fail, including oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and wheel speed sensors. This can trigger warning lights and affect engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ per sensor.

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Buttons/Surfaces**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft-touch plastics used on the interior can become sticky and degrade over time, particularly in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the component.

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can be slow, outdated, and prone to glitches.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available) or replacing the unit with an aftermarket solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $5,000+ depending on the solution.

**Recalls:**

*   **NHTSA Recall Number:** 15V453000 - Fuel Leakage

**Summary**

The 2014 Lamborghini Aventador, while an exhilarating supercar, is not without its potential issues. Engine oil leaks, cooling system problems, and transmission issues (particularly related to the ISR transmission) are common concerns. Electrical problems such as battery drain and sensor failures also occur. Interior components can degrade over time. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying significantly depending on the specific problem and the cost of Lamborghini parts and labor. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the high maintenance costs associated with owning such a high-performance vehicle.
