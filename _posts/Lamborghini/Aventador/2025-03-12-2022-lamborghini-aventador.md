Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Lamborghini Aventador Ultimae, organized as requested.  The Aventador, in its final Ultimae iteration, represents the pinnacle of Lamborghini's naturally aspirated V12 era. It's celebrated for its raw power, dramatic styling, and visceral driving experience. Owners love the car's exclusivity and head-turning presence. However, the Aventador is not without its drawbacks, including a stiff ride, limited practicality, and high running costs. The Aventador Ultimae uses a 6.5L V12 engine producing 769 horsepower and 531 lb-ft of torque paired exclusively with a 7-speed ISR (Independent Shifting Rod) automated manual transmission. No other engine or transmission options were available for this model year.

**Summary**

The 2022 Lamborghini Aventador Ultimae, while an extraordinary performance machine, is not immune to issues. Owners should be aware of potential oil and coolant leaks, clutch wear associated with the ISR transmission, and possible electrical glitches. Suspension components, particularly the Magneride dampers, are also prone to failure. While the issues aren't necessarily widespread, the costs associated with repairs can be significant, reflecting the exotic nature of the vehicle. The overall severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major mechanical problems. Repair costs are generally high due to the specialized parts and labor required. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended.
