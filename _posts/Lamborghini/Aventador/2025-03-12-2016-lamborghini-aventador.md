The 2016 Lamborghini Aventador is a supercar renowned for its aggressive styling, blistering performance, and exotic appeal. It features a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine producing 690 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed ISR (Independent Shifting Rod) automated manual transmission. Later models and variants, like the Aventador S and SVJ, received power increases. Owners often praise the Aventador for its raw driving experience, exhilarating sound, and head-turning design. Common complaints include its limited practicality, harsh ride, and the clunky nature of the single-clutch ISR transmission at low speeds.

**Summary:**

The 2016 Lamborghini Aventador is a high-performance supercar with equally high-performance maintenance costs. The most significant potential expenses are related to the transmission (clutch wear, hydraulic actuators) and engine (oil leaks). Electrical issues and suspension problems can also be costly to repair. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget accordingly for potential repairs. While some issues can be relatively minor, others can lead to substantial repair bills, highlighting the importance of a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Lamborghini technician.
