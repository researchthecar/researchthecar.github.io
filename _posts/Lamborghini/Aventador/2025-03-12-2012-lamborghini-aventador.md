The 2012 Lamborghini Aventador is a high-performance supercar featuring a 6.5-liter V12 engine producing 690 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission available was a 7-speed ISR (Independent Shifting Rod) automated manual transmission. Known for its aggressive styling, blistering acceleration, and exotic appeal, the Aventador also has drawbacks including a harsh ride, limited visibility, and high running costs. Owners often love the car's dramatic presence and exhilarating performance but dislike its sometimes temperamental nature and the inherent compromises that come with owning such a specialized vehicle.

**Engine**

**6.5L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a relatively common issue reported, often originating from various gaskets and seals around the engine. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets and seals. Requires careful disassembly and reassembly of engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on location and extent of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires can occur due to failing coil packs. This can lead to rough running, reduced power, and illumination of the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000 (depending on the number of coils replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed ISR Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The single-clutch ISR transmission is known for relatively rapid clutch wear, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping during gear changes, jerky engagement, and difficulty selecting gears.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Actuator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the hydraulic actuators that control gear changes can lead to difficulty shifting, delayed shifts, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the faulty actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original dampers are prone to leaking and premature failure. This will result in reduced handling performance and ride comfort, as well as excessive bouncing.
    *   Solution: Replace the dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, especially when the car is left sitting for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of parasitic drain. Possible replacement of the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the car (e.g., ABS sensors, TPMS sensors) can fail, leading to warning lights and potential malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ (per sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Hydraulic Lift System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The optional front lift system (for clearing obstacles) can experience hydraulic leaks or pump failures.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the hydraulic components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some interior trim pieces, especially those with a soft-touch coating, can become sticky and degrade over time, particularly in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Refinishing or replacing the affected trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the issue and the trim pieces involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

In summary, the 2012 Lamborghini Aventador, while an extraordinary vehicle, presents a range of potential issues that can be costly to address. The most significant concerns revolve around the transmission's clutch wear and potential hydraulic problems, engine oil leaks, suspension damper issues, and certain electrical gremlins. Interior trim degradation is also a reported issue. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical repairs. The estimated costs to fix these issues range from a few hundred dollars to upwards of $10,000+ depending on the problem and the repair shop. Due to the specialized nature of the car and its components, and the relatively low production volume, replacement parts can be expensive and difficult to source.
