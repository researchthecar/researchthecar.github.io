## Engine

### 6.5L V12 Naturally Aspirated
**Cooling System Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Overheating, coolant smell, visible coolant puddles under the vehicle.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of hoses, seals, or radiator. Professional diagnosis is recommended.
- **Cost:** $800 - $2,500

**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Low oil level warnings, blue smoke from exhaust under acceleration.
- **Solution:** Engine internal inspection, potential piston ring or valve seal replacement. Regular oil level checks are vital.
- **Cost:** $3,000 - $8,000+


## Transmission

### ISR (Independent Shifting Rod) 7-Speed Automated Manual
**Clutch Actuator Malfunction**
- **Symptoms:** Difficulty shifting gears, 'transmission failure' warnings, jerky gear changes.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and replacement of the clutch actuator or related hydraulic components. Requires specialized tools and knowledge.
- **Cost:** $4,000 - $7,000

**Mechatronic Unit Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Erratic gear selection, inability to engage gears, dashboard warnings.
- **Solution:** Software updates or replacement of the mechatronic control unit. Professional calibration is essential.
- **Cost:** $5,000 - $9,000


## Suspension

### Magnetorheological Dampers
**Damper Leaks/Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Harsh ride, clunking noises, 'suspension fault' warning lights.
- **Solution:** Replacement of individual magnetorheological dampers. These are specialized and costly components.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,000 per damper


## Electrical

### Infotainment System
**Screen Freezing/Unresponsiveness**
- **Symptoms:** Infotainment screen becomes unresponsive, freezes, or restarts randomly.
- **Solution:** Software updates or potential replacement of the head unit. Dealer diagnosis is typically required.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $3,000


### Battery Drain
**Parasitic Drain**
- **Symptoms:** Battery dies unexpectedly, car won't start after short periods of inactivity.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic drain (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory). Professional electrical diagnosis is crucial.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1,500


## Exterior

### Aerodynamic Components
**Active Aero Malfunctions**
- **Symptoms:** Rear wing not deploying/retracting correctly, 'aero system fault' warnings.
- **Solution:** Inspection and repair/replacement of actuators, motors, or control modules for the active aerodynamic elements. Requires specialized knowledge.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $5,000+


## Interior

### Interior Trim and Electronics
**No widespread issues reported.**
- **Symptoms:** N/A
- **Solution:** N/A
- **Cost:** Varies
