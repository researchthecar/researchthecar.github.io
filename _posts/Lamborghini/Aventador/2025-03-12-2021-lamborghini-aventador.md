The 2021 Lamborghini Aventador LP 780-4 Ultimae represents the final iteration of the iconic Aventador model, boasting a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine producing 769 horsepower and 531 lb-ft of torque. All Aventadors use a 7-speed ISR (Independent Shifting Rod) automated manual transmission. Owners appreciate the Aventador for its aggressive styling, ferocious engine sound, and exhilarating performance. Common criticisms include its harsh ride, limited practicality, and high running costs.

**Engine**

**6.5L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report oil leaks developing from various engine seals, particularly around the valve covers and oil pan. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty seals and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ depending on the location and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from hoses or connections. Visual inspection reveals coolant dripping under the vehicle and low coolant level.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty hose or tighten the hose clamp.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed ISR Automated Manual**

*   **Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ISR transmission is known for its aggressive and sometimes jerky shifting, especially at low speeds. This is inherent to the design, not necessarily a "problem," but it can be a common complaint.
    *   Solution: There is no fix for this; it is part of the transmission's inherent behavior. Some owners report that a TCU (Transmission Control Unit) reflash can improve the smoothness of the shifting slightly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (for TCU reflash, if available).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The single-clutch automated manual can exhibit premature clutch wear, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty engaging gears, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ride Harshness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Aventador's suspension, while performance-oriented, is known for its stiffness and harshness, especially over rough roads. This is a characteristic of the car's design rather than a specific defect, but it's a common complaint.
    *   Solution: There is no "fix" for this as it's how the suspension is tuned. Some owners explore aftermarket suspension options, such as adjustable coilovers, to improve ride quality, but this can affect handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (aftermarket solutions vary widely in cost).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensor malfunctions can occur, leading to warning lights on the dashboard. These can include ABS sensor, TPMS sensor, or other engine/drivetrain-related sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is failing and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+, depending on the sensor and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Aventadors are known to be prone to battery drain, especially when not driven regularly.
    *   Solution: Use a battery tender when the car is not in use or replace the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Adhesive Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adhesive used to secure interior trim pieces can sometimes fail, leading to panels becoming loose or detaching. This is most commonly reported on the dashboard or door panels.
    *   Solution: Re-applying adhesive or replacing the affected trim piece.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and the specific panel involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Lamborghini Aventador is an incredible performance vehicle, but it is not without its potential issues. The most common issues include oil leaks, jerky transmission, electrical problems, and interior trim adhesive failure. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs. The cost of fixing these issues can vary greatly, from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements or minor leaks to several thousand dollars for clutch replacements or more extensive engine repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their ownership costs.
