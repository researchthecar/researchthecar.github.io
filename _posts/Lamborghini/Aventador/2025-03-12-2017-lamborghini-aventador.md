Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2017 Lamborghini Aventador, categorized by major components and addressing the specific engine and transmission options available.

The 2017 Lamborghini Aventador is a supercar known for its aggressive styling, blistering performance, and unmistakable presence. It is powered by a naturally aspirated 6.5L V12 engine producing 730 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque in its base configuration, and up to 759 horsepower in the Aventador SV model. All Aventador models utilize a 7-speed ISR (Independent Shifting Rod) automated manual transmission. Owners love the car's exotic looks, thrilling acceleration, and the sound of the V12. Common dislikes include the rough ride quality, limited visibility, and high running costs.

**Engine**

**6.5L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various areas of the engine, including valve covers, oil pan, and around the timing chain cover. Symptoms include visible oil spots under the car, a burning oil smell, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty gasket or seal. In some cases, more extensive repairs might be needed if the leak is due to a crack in the engine block or cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a noticeable loss of power. The check engine light will illuminate, and a diagnostic scan will reveal misfire codes.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It's often recommended to replace all coils at once for preventative maintenance, especially if they are nearing the end of their lifespan.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on how many coils are replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, a rattling noise from underneath the car, and a sulfur-like smell. The check engine light will illuminate with codes related to catalytic converter inefficiency.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed ISR Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, difficulty shifting, jerky engagement, and a burning smell. The transmission may also make unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch. This often includes replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, slow or delayed gear changes, and potential error messages on the dashboard related to the transmission system.
    *   Solution: Replace the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gear Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Incorrect gear displayed on the dashboard, inability to shift into certain gears, and potential error messages related to gear position.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty gear position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll, and noises (clunking or squeaking) coming from the suspension. Leaking fluid from the damper is also a sign of failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty damper(s) or shock absorber(s). It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear) to maintain balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ depending on the system (standard vs. magnetic ride control) and number of dampers replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lift System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front lift system might fail to raise the front of the car, or it may raise unevenly. This can be caused by issues with the hydraulic pump, actuators, or sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the issue and repair or replace the faulty component. This could involve replacing the hydraulic pump, actuator, or sensor, or repairing a leak in the hydraulic lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven frequently. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the parasitic drain. This could be caused by a faulty module, a short circuit, or an accessory that is not turning off properly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights may illuminate on the dashboard due to faulty sensors. Common sensor issues include oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and wheel speed sensors.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or have limited functionality. The screen may also display errors or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates might resolve some issues. In other cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Lamborghini Aventador, while an incredible performance machine, is prone to several common issues. Engine issues, such as oil leaks and ignition coil failures, can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to costly repairs. The ISR transmission can suffer from clutch wear and hydraulic pump failures, which can be very expensive to address. Suspension problems, particularly with the dampers and front lift system, can also be costly. Electrical issues, such as battery drain and sensor failures, are common across many vehicles and range in severity.  Overall, owning an Aventador requires being prepared for potential high repair costs.
