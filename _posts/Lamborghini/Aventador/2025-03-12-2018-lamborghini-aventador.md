The 2018 Lamborghini Aventador is a high-performance supercar known for its aggressive styling, powerful engine, and exhilarating driving experience. The standard engine is a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 producing 730 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque in the Aventador S trim. The SVJ variant, released in 2018, bumps the power up to 770 horsepower and 531 lb-ft of torque. A single-clutch ISR (Independent Shifting Rods) 7-speed automated manual transmission is the only transmission option. People love the Aventador for its striking design, raw power, and the visceral experience it provides. Common dislikes include the firm ride, somewhat dated infotainment system, and the inherent impracticality of a low-slung supercar.

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and timing chain cover. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, the smell of burning oil, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can occur due to faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. Symptoms include rough idling, loss of power, and the check engine light illuminating.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on the affected components.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed ISR Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: The single-clutch automated manual transmission is known for aggressive clutch engagement and relatively short clutch life, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping clutch, jerky shifts, and difficulty engaging gears.
    * Solution: Replacing the clutch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+ due to the complexity and cost of parts.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission relies on a hydraulic pump to actuate the gear changes. These pumps can fail over time. Symptoms include difficulty shifting, error messages on the dashboard, and complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Suspension Component Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Due to the low ride height and stiff suspension, components such as ball joints, bushings, and shocks can wear prematurely, especially with frequent use on rough roads. Symptoms include clunking noises, uneven tire wear, and poor handling.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $5000+ depending on the components needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the vehicle (ABS, TPMS, etc.) can malfunction, leading to error messages on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Aventadors, like many high-performance vehicles, can experience battery drain issues, especially if not driven regularly. This can be due to parasitic drain from various electrical systems.
    * Solution: Identifying and resolving the source of the parasitic drain or using a battery tender when the car is not in use.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for diagnosis and minor repairs; battery replacement is ~$300+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the repair method and component.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Lamborghini Aventador, while a thrilling and desirable supercar, does have some known issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the transmission (especially clutch wear), potential engine oil leaks, and electrical glitches. The cost of repairs can be substantial, reflecting the high cost of parts and specialized labor required for such a high-performance vehicle. Addressing these potential issues proactively through regular maintenance can help mitigate risks and ensure a more enjoyable ownership experience.
