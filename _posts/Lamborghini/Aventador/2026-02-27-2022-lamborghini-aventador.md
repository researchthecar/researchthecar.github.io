### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Lamborghini Aventador, with its potent 6.5L V12 engine, is engineered for extreme performance and generally exhibits strong mechanical reliability. The primary areas of concern tend to be the complex ISR automated manual transmission, which can experience issues with its clutch actuator and hydraulic systems, and potential malfunctions in optional magnetorheological dampers. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Exterior and interior components, while luxurious, are largely robust, with isolated issues like active aero actuator failures. Overall, the Aventador is a reliable supercar for its class, but owners should be prepared for the specialized maintenance and potential costs associated with its exotic nature, especially concerning the transmission and advanced electronic systems.
