## Engine

### 6.5L V12 Naturally Aspirated
**Cooling System Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Overheating, coolant smell, visible coolant puddles under the vehicle.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of hoses, seals, or radiator. Professional diagnosis is recommended.
- **Cost:** $800 - $2,500

**Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
- **Symptoms:** Exhaust leaks, ticking noise on startup, potential loss of power.
- **Solution:** Replacement of cracked exhaust manifold. High-performance exhaust systems may be an upgrade option.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $4,000


## Transmission

### ISR (Independent Shifting Rods) 7-Speed Automated Manual
**Clutch Actuator Malfunction**
- **Symptoms:** Difficulty shifting gears, transmission warning lights, jerky gear changes.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and replacement of the clutch actuator. Requires specialized tools and expertise.
- **Cost:** $3,000 - $7,000

**Hydraulic System Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Slow or hesitant gear changes, transmission fluid leaks, warning lights.
