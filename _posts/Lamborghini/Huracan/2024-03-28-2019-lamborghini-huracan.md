**Introduction**

The 2019 Lamborghini Huracan is a high-performance sports car known for its powerful engine, sleek design, and agile handling. It is powered by a naturally aspirated 5.2L V10 engine that produces 610 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission that sends power to all four wheels.

While the Huracan is highly praised for its performance and driving dynamics, it has not been without its share of issues. Here is a comprehensive list of the specific problems reported by owners:

**Engine**

* **5.2L V10 Engine**
    * **Exhaust Valve Failure:** Premature wear of the exhaust valves can cause a loss of power, increased emissions, and a rattling noise. Fix involves replacing the affected valves. *$2,000 - $3,000+
    * **Carbon Buildup:** Excessive carbon buildup in the engine can lead to reduced performance, increased fuel consumption, and misfiring. A cleaning procedure is required to remove the carbon deposits. *$500 - $1,500+
    * **EGR Valve Issues:** Malfunctioning EGR valves can result in increased emissions and poor engine performance. The EGR valve needs to be replaced or cleaned. *$200 - $500+

**Transmission**

* **7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**
    * **Clutch Pack Failure:** Worn or damaged clutch packs can cause slipping, shuddering, or difficulty engaging gears. Requires transmission disassembly and clutch replacement. *$5,000 - $10,000+
    * **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** Faulty mechatronic units can lead to shifting problems, loss of power, and transmission warnings. Replacement of the mechatronic unit is necessary. *$3,000 - $5,000+
    * **Software Issues:** Transmission software glitches can cause shifting delays, harsh shifts, or other transmission abnormalities. Software updates or reprogramming may resolve the issue. *$500 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension:**
    * **Strut Mount Failure:** Worn or damaged strut mounts can cause a knocking noise and reduced handling stability. Requires replacement of the strut mounts. *$400 - $800+
* **Rear Suspension:**
    * **Rear Shock Absorber Failure:** Leaking or ineffective rear shock absorbers can result in poor ride quality and reduced stability. Replacement of the shock absorbers is required. *$600 - $1,200+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Premature battery discharge can occur due to electrical system malfunctions or parasitic drains. Requires diagnosis and repair of the faulty electrical components. *$500 - $1,500+
* **Infotainment System Issues:** Malfunctioning infotainment systems can experience glitches, freezing, or loss of functionality. Software updates or hardware replacement may be necessary. *$500 - $2,000+

**Exterior**
