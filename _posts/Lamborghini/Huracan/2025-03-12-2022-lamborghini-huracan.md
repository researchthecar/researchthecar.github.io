Here's a breakdown of reported issues for the 2022 Lamborghini Huracan, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2022 Lamborghini Huracan is a high-performance sports car celebrated for its aggressive styling, exhilarating performance, and engaging driving experience. It is available in several variants, including the Evo, STO, and Tecnica, each offering a unique blend of track-focused abilities and road-going comfort. The most common engine option is the 5.2L naturally aspirated V10, producing around 602-630 horsepower and 413-417 lb-ft of torque. All Huracan models use a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's incredible acceleration, sharp handling, and distinctive exhaust note. Some common complaints include the limited practicality due to low ground clearance and a firm ride, as well as the high cost of ownership and maintenance.

**Engine**

**5.2L Naturally Aspirated V10**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, especially during track use or aggressive driving. Symptoms include the need to add oil more frequently than anticipated between service intervals, potentially leading to low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and topping off as needed is a common practice. In some cases, dealers have performed oil consumption tests to determine if the engine is within acceptable parameters. If consumption is deemed excessive, more extensive repairs (such as piston ring replacement) might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $15,000+ (for major engine work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of fuel injector failure leading to rough running, misfires, and potential check engine light activation. This issue has been noted more frequently in cars that see track use.
    * Solution: Diagnosis involves checking fuel injector performance. Replacement of faulty injectors is the usual remedy.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the number of injectors and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Clutch Wear/Judder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners, especially those who frequently track their Huracan or drive aggressively, have experienced premature clutch wear or judder during low-speed maneuvers. This can manifest as jerky engagement or slipping during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is the common solution. Some owners opt for aftermarket performance clutches designed for increased durability. Proper driving technique and avoiding excessive launches can help prolong clutch life.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+ (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: This involves issues with the TCU that controls the gear changes. Symptoms may include difficulty shifting gears, sudden gear changes while driving, or complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of the mechatronic unit. Requires specialized knowledge and equipment.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Dampers (Optional)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners with the optional magnetic ride suspension have reported damper failures, leading to a decrease in ride quality and handling performance. Leaks or unusual noises from the dampers are common indicators.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty damper(s). It's often recommended to replace dampers in pairs to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (per pair, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally exhibit glitches such as freezing, slow response times, or connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates often resolve these issues. In some cases, a complete system reset or hardware replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) to $2,000+ (for hardware replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of excessive battery drain, especially if the car is left unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly inspect the electrical system for parasitic draws. Consider using a battery tender/maintainer if the car is frequently stored. Battery replacement if deemed necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (battery replacement), Variable for parasitic draw diagnostics.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Adhesive Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adhesive holding some interior trim pieces, particularly on the dashboard and door panels, can sometimes fail in hot climates, causing the trim to sag or detach.
    *   Solution: Re-application of adhesive or replacement of the affected trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity and parts involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Lamborghini Huracan, while an exceptional performance machine, can present owners with some notable issues. The most common problems appear to revolve around the engine (oil consumption, fuel injector failure) and transmission (clutch wear, mechatronic unit). Electrical and suspension issues also arise, and, to a lesser extent, interior trim issues can be encountered. The severity of these issues ranges from minor infotainment glitches to major engine or transmission repairs. The cost of addressing these problems can be significant, reflecting the car's exotic nature and the specialized knowledge required for its maintenance. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential expenses and factor them into their ownership budget.
