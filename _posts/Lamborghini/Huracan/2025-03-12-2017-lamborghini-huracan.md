The 2017 Lamborghini Huracan is a mid-engine sports car known for its exhilarating performance and striking design. It's equipped with a naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V10 engine, delivering around 602 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque in the base LP610-4 model. Other variations such as the Performante boosted this to around 631 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque. All models use a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners appreciate the Huracan's raw power, sharp handling, and distinctive exhaust note. However, some criticisms include its firm ride, limited practicality, and the potential for high running costs.

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during gear changes, difficulty engaging gears, jerky movements, and a general lack of smooth acceleration. This can be exacerbated by aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+ depending on whether it's just the clutch pack, or other damage to the transmission.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, failure to engage certain gears, and error messages on the dashboard. The mechatronic unit controls the shifting mechanism.
    *   Solution: The mechatronic unit is typically replaced or rebuilt. Sometimes a software update can address minor issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ depending on whether it's a replacement or rebuild and the shop performing the work.
