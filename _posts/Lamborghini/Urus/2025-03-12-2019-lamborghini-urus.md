The 2019 Lamborghini Urus is a high-performance SUV blending Lamborghini's iconic design with everyday practicality. It's exclusively powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 641 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque. All Urus models are equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Urus for its aggressive styling, incredible acceleration, and surprisingly agile handling for its size. Criticisms often revolve around its high price tag, polarizing design, and potential for expensive maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**4.0L Twin-Turbocharged V8**

* **Oil Leaks from Turbocharger Oil Lines**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks originating from the fittings or lines supplying oil to the turbochargers. This can result in a burning oil smell, visible oil drips, and potentially low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty oil lines and/or fittings with updated parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks from Turbocharger Coolant Lines**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the oil leak issue, coolant leaks may occur from the turbocharger coolant lines or their fittings. Symptoms include a coolant smell, visible coolant drips, and potential overheating.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking coolant lines and/or fittings with improved parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Failure of Ignition Coils**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, check engine light illumination. Diagnostic codes pointing to specific cylinder misfires.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty ignition coils. Replacing all coils at the same time is recommended to ensure consistent performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on how many coils are replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed gear changes, particularly noticeable during low-speed driving or when shifting between certain gears.
    * Solution: Software update to the transmission control module (TCM). If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (software update), $3,000 - $8,000+ (valve body/transmission)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Failure (Rare, but documented)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Complete loss of drive, inability to shift gears, loud noises coming from the transmission.
    * Solution: Transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000 - $20,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle fails to maintain proper ride height, sagging on one or more corners. Error messages related to the air suspension system. The compressor may be unusually noisy or fail to operate altogether.
    * Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor. Check for leaks in the air lines and struts as well.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Air Strut Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging, especially overnight, hissing sound from the struts, error messages related to air suspension.
    * Solution: Replacement of leaking air struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ per strut (depending on location)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, slow response times, inability to connect to Bluetooth or other devices.
    * Solution: Software update for the infotainment system. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $3,000+ (unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery frequently dies, especially if the car sits for a few days.
    * Solution: Identify and repair the parasitic draw. Common causes include faulty modules or accessories that are not shutting down properly. Replacing a weak battery can also help, but won't fix a parasitic draw issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sensor Failures (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic behavior or complete failure of parking sensors or blind spot monitoring systems. False alarms, failure to detect objects, or error messages.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per sensor (depending on location and function)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Creaking/Rattling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Annoying creaking or rattling noises coming from the dashboard, especially when driving on rough roads.
    * Solution: Identification and isolation of the source of the noise. This may involve tightening fasteners, adding padding, or replacing loose components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity of the repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Lamborghini Urus presents a mix of performance and potential problems. While the engine delivers impressive power, oil and coolant leaks from the turbocharger system are relatively common. Transmission issues, while not widespread, can be expensive to fix. Air suspension problems are also a concern, with compressor and strut failures leading to significant repair costs. Electrical glitches in the infotainment system and sensor failures are also reported. Overall, owning a 2019 Urus can be an exciting experience, but buyers should be aware of the potential for costly repairs and maintenance. Addressing issues early can help mitigate more significant problems down the road.
