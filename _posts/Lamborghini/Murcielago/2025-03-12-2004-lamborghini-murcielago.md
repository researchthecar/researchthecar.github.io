The 2004 Lamborghini Murcielago marked a new era for Lamborghini under Audi ownership. It featured a 6.2-liter V12 engine producing 572 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. Power was delivered to all four wheels through either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed e-gear automated manual transmission. Owners often praised the car's aggressive styling, exhilarating performance, and the visceral experience of driving a V12 Lamborghini. Criticisms often included the high running costs, somewhat clunky e-gear transmission (if equipped), and limited visibility.

**Engine**

**6.2L V12**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various locations including valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, and oil cooler lines. Symptoms include visible oil spots under the car, low oil level warnings, and a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals. Inspect and replace oil cooler lines if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the source of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are common, often originating from hoses, the water pump, or radiator. Symptoms include low coolant level, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    * Solution: Replace leaking hoses, water pump, or radiator. Pressure test the cooling system to identify all leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Vacuum Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vacuum leaks can cause rough idling, poor performance, and check engine lights. Leaks can occur in various vacuum lines and intake manifold gaskets.
    * Solution: Smoke test the intake and vacuum system. Replace damaged lines, gaskets, and intake manifold gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear is common due to the car's weight and power output, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and a high clutch pedal engagement point.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed E-Gear Automated Manual**

* **Clutch Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the manual transmission, the e-gear system is susceptible to clutch wear, especially with aggressive driving and improper use of the system. Symptoms include jerky shifting, difficulty engaging gears, and error messages related to the clutch.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch pack and potentially other components of the e-gear system. Recalibrate the e-gear system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5000 - $10,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **E-Gear Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The e-gear actuator, responsible for shifting gears, can fail due to wear and tear or internal component failure. Symptoms include failure to shift gears, error messages, and a complete loss of transmission function.
    * Solution: Replace the e-gear actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4000 - $8000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Lift System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The optional front lift system, used to raise the front of the car to clear obstacles, can develop leaks or malfunctions. Symptoms include the inability to raise the front of the car, uneven lifting, and hydraulic fluid leaks.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the hydraulic pump, struts, or lines associated with the front lift system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster can experience intermittent failures, including display issues, flickering lights, and inaccurate readings.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some Murcielagos experience excessive battery drain, especially when left sitting for extended periods. This can be caused by parasitic draws from various electrical components.
    * Solution: Identify and eliminate the source of the parasitic draw. Replace the battery if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The headlights may develop condensation or experience bulb failures. The headlight lenses can also become cloudy or yellowed over time.
    * Solution: Replace bulbs, reseal headlight housings to address condensation, or replace the entire headlight assembly. Polish or replace the headlight lenses.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sticky Interior Trim**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some interior trim pieces, particularly those coated with a soft-touch material, can become sticky and deteriorated over time.
    * Solution: Refinish or replace the affected trim pieces.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the issue and the trim pieces involved.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Lamborghini Murcielago, while offering exhilarating performance and iconic styling, presents several potential issues for owners. Engine oil and coolant leaks are fairly common, as is clutch wear, particularly on e-gear equipped models. Electrical gremlins can also surface. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly, but owners should be prepared for potentially expensive maintenance and repairs. The e-gear system, while offering a unique driving experience, is a known area of potential expense.
