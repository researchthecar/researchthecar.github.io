The 2001 Lamborghini Murciélago marked a significant shift for the Italian automaker under new ownership by Audi. It retained the iconic V12 engine but featured a completely new design and modern technology. The initial engine option was a 6.2-liter V12, producing 572 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual transmission or an optional e-gear automated manual transmission. Owners love the raw, visceral driving experience, the aggressive styling, and the exclusivity of the Murciélago. However, common complaints include the high running costs, potential reliability issues associated with early production models, and the challenging ergonomics for everyday use.

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, and oil cooler lines. Symptoms include visible oil puddles under the car, low oil pressure warnings, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets, seals, or lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the location and complexity of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating can occur due to radiator leaks, faulty thermostats, or failing water pumps. Symptoms include high temperature readings on the gauge, coolant leaks, and steam emanating from the engine bay.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty components, flushing the cooling system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks or disconnections in vacuum lines can lead to rough idling, poor performance, and error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing damaged vacuum lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear is a common issue, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and a high engagement point.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**E-Gear Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E-Gear system, being an early iteration of automated manual technology, is prone to actuator failures. Symptoms include difficulty shifting, failure to engage gears, and error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the clutch actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hydraulic pump that provides pressure for the E-Gear system can fail. Symptoms include slow or erratic shifting, warning lights, and eventual inability to shift.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Shock Absorber Leaks/Failure**

**Summary**

The 2001 Lamborghini Murciélago, while a stunning and iconic supercar, is not without its potential issues. The most common issues involve the engine, transmission (particularly the E-Gear system), and electrical components. Repairs can be expensive due to the complexity of the car and the cost of specialized parts and labor. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. Thorough pre-purchase inspections by qualified Lamborghini technicians are highly recommended. The E-Gear transmission is often the most expensive and frequently-occurring issue, followed by oil leaks and suspension issues.
