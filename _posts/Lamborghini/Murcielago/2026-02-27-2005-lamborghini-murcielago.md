### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Lamborghini Murciélago, while a mechanical marvel, demands significant investment in maintenance and potential repairs. The V12 engine and its associated cooling systems are generally robust but can develop leaks. The E-Gear transmission, a complex automated manual, is more prone to issues with its hydraulic system and solenoids compared to the traditional manual gearbox. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the body control module and infotainment, can be frustrating. The unique scissor door mechanisms also require attention. Owners should budget for specialized maintenance and be prepared for potentially high repair costs, especially for the transmission and electrical systems. Despite these points, with diligent care, the Murciélago remains a highly desirable and capable supercar.
