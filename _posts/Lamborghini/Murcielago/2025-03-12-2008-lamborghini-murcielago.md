The 2008 Lamborghini Murcielago is a stunning supercar known for its aggressive styling, powerful V12 engine, and exhilarating performance. The 2008 model year was offered with a 6.2-liter V12 engine producing 572 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed e-gear automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the Murcielago for its distinctive appearance, raw driving experience, and the visceral sound of its V12 engine. However, some common complaints include the high cost of maintenance, the somewhat temperamental e-gear transmission, and the limited practicality due to its low ground clearance and wide body.
