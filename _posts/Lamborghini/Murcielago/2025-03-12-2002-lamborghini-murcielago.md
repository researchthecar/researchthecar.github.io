The 2002 Lamborghini Murciélago, the first model produced under Audi ownership, represents a significant shift for the Lamborghini brand. It features a 6.2L V12 engine producing 572 hp and 479 lb-ft of torque. This engine was initially paired with a 6-speed manual transmission and later an optional "E-gear" automated manual transmission became available. Owners generally praise the Murciélago for its aggressive styling, raw driving experience, and iconic V12 sound. Common complaints revolve around high maintenance costs, limited practicality, and the unrefined nature of the E-gear transmission.

**Engine**

**6.2L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Murciélago uses individual coil packs for each cylinder. Failure of one or more coil packs can cause misfires, rough idling, and a loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per coil pack, plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vacuum lines can crack and leak over time, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, and potential check engine lights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the damaged vacuum lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch wear is common in high-performance vehicles, and the Murciélago is no exception. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and a high clutch pedal engagement point.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ including labor, as it often requires engine removal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**E-Gear Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the manual transmission, clutch wear is a significant concern with the E-gear system. The automated shifts, while offering performance advantages, can accelerate clutch wear, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include jerky shifts, clutch slippage, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch assembly. This often involves specialized knowledge and equipment to properly calibrate the E-gear system after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ due to the complexity of the system and required calibration.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E-gear system relies on a hydraulic pump to actuate the clutch and shift gears. The pump can fail over time, leading to shifting problems, error messages, and complete failure of the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ including labor and system programming.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E-gear system uses various sensors to monitor clutch position, gear selection, and hydraulic pressure. Malfunctions in these sensors can cause erratic shifting, error messages, and poor performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the sensor and labor involved in diagnosis and replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Murciélago features an independent suspension system with hydraulic shocks. These shocks can leak over time, resulting in a bouncy ride, poor handling, and reduced control.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ for a full set of shocks, plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with the instrument cluster, including flickering displays, inaccurate readings, and complete failure.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether the cluster can be repaired or needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Parasitic battery drain can be an issue, especially if the car is not driven regularly. This can lead to a dead battery and difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the battery drain, which could be a faulty module, a short circuit, or an aftermarket accessory.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the issue and the labor involved in diagnosis and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation can accumulate inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the headlights.
    *   Solution: Removing and resealing the headlight housings or replacing the headlights.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on whether the headlights can be resealed or need to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common with many Italian cars from this era, the interior trim pieces, especially those with a soft-touch coating, can become sticky and degrade over time.
    *   Solution: Refinishing or replacing the affected trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the number of pieces and the chosen solution (refinishing vs. replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Lamborghini Murciélago, while a stunning and iconic supercar, is not without its potential issues. The most serious and costly issues typically involve the E-gear transmission (if equipped) and clutch replacements on both transmission options. Engine oil leaks and electrical gremlins are also common. Prospective buyers should factor in significant maintenance costs when considering ownership. The severity of the issues varies, but neglecting them can lead to further damage and higher repair bills. Pre-purchase inspections by qualified Lamborghini technicians are highly recommended.
