### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Lamborghini Murciélago is a remarkable supercar with a generally robust mechanical foundation. The V12 engine, while powerful, can be susceptible to cooling system issues and clutch actuator problems, particularly with age and mileage. The E-gear transmission, while offering rapid shifts, is more prone to hydraulic and electronic component failures than its manual counterpart. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and window regulator issues, are not uncommon. Interior wear, especially on high-contact surfaces like the driver's seat, is also a consideration. Despite these potential issues, the Murciélago remains a desirable exotic, but prospective owners should budget for specialized maintenance and potential repairs.
