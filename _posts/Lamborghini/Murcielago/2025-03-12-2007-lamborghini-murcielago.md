The 2007 Lamborghini Murcielago is a mid-engine supercar boasting aggressive styling and exhilarating performance. The primary engine option was a 6.2-liter V12 engine producing around 580 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. This engine was offered with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed e-gear automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the Murcielago for its raw power, iconic design, and the visceral experience of driving a V12 Lamborghini. Common complaints include the high cost of maintenance, the temperamental nature of the e-gear transmission, and limited practicality for everyday use.
