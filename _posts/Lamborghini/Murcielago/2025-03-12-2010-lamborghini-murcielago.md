Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2010 Lamborghini Murcielago, following your requested format. The 2010 Lamborghini Murcielago is the final year of production for this iconic V12 supercar. Powered by a 6.5L V12 engine, producing around 640 horsepower and 487 lb-ft of torque in the base LP640 model, and up to 670 horsepower in the LP670-4 SuperVeloce, this car offers blistering performance. The engine is coupled with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed e-gear automated manual transmission. Owners love the Murcielago for its aggressive styling, the visceral experience of the V12 engine, and its exclusivity. However, the high running costs, challenging handling at the limit, and the somewhat dated technology can be drawbacks for some.

**Engine**

**6.5L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various engine seals and gaskets. The most common leak points include valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and seals. This often requires significant disassembly, especially for the rear main seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Individual coil packs can fail, leading to misfires, rough running, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coil pack. It's often recommended to replace all coil packs at the same time to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000 (depending on how many are replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed E-Gear (Automated Manual)**

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E-Gear system uses a hydraulically actuated clutch. The clutch can wear out prematurely, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping, jerky engagement, and difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch. This requires removing the transmission and can be a labor-intensive process.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E-Gear system relies on a hydraulic pump to operate the clutch and shift gears. The pump can fail, leading to difficulty shifting or a complete inability to change gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lift System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some Murcielagos are equipped with a front lift system to navigate speed bumps and steep driveways. This system can develop leaks in the hydraulic lines or failure of the hydraulic pump.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty components (lines, pump, or struts).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the component and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Murcielagos are known for having a parasitic battery drain, especially when not driven regularly. This can lead to a dead battery.
    *   Solution: Installing a battery tender/maintainer or disconnecting the battery when the car is stored for extended periods. Locating the source of the drain, which could be a faulty module or aftermarket accessory, and repairing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause of the drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ECU Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If an ECU problem develops, this could trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the ECU and recalibrating it to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft-touch coating on some interior trim pieces (especially buttons and switchgear) can become sticky and deteriorated over time, particularly in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Removing the old coating and refinishing the trim pieces. Replacing the trim pieces can be very expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the problem and the chosen solution).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Lamborghini Murcielago, while an impressive supercar, can be prone to certain issues, typical of high-performance vehicles. Engine oil leaks and E-Gear transmission problems (clutch wear and hydraulic pump failure) are some of the most significant potential expenses. Electrical gremlins, like battery drain, can also be frustrating. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to upwards of $10,000 for major repairs. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the car's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Lamborghini technician to assess the condition of the car.
