### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Lamborghini Murciélago, while an extraordinary machine, presents reliability considerations typical of exotic supercars. The V12 engine is generally robust, but potential issues with cooling systems and oil leaks require vigilant monitoring. The E-Gear transmission, while offering rapid shifts, is more prone to hydraulic and electronic faults than the manual. Suspension components, particularly adaptive dampers, can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and infotainment system glitches, are also noted. Owners should expect higher maintenance and repair costs compared to mainstream vehicles, with specialized knowledge and parts often required. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to any developing problems, the Murciélago can remain a thrilling and rewarding ownership experience.
