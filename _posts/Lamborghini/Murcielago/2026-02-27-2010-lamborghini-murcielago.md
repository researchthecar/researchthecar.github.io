### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Lamborghini Murciélago is a highly desirable supercar with a generally robust powertrain, especially the V12 engine. However, its exotic nature means that repairs, particularly for the E-gear transmission and adaptive suspension, can be significantly more expensive than for mainstream vehicles. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment issues and window regulators, are not uncommon. Owners should be prepared for higher maintenance costs and seek out specialists familiar with Lamborghini vehicles. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, the potential for costly repairs in specific areas necessitates diligent maintenance and a substantial budget for upkeep.
