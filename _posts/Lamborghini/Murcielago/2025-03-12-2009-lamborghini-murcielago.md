The 2009 Lamborghini Murcielago is a stunning supercar known for its aggressive styling, powerful performance, and iconic scissor doors. The 2009 models are generally highly regarded, boasting improvements and refinements over earlier years. The Murcielago came standard with a 6.5L V12 engine producing around 640 horsepower and 487 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed e-gear automated manual transmission. Owners love the Murcielago for its raw power, distinctive design, and the thrill of driving a true exotic. Common dislikes include the high running costs, relatively outdated infotainment system (for its time), and the sometimes harsh ride quality.

**Engine**

**6.5L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue on high mileage Murcielagos. The leaks can originate from various locations, including the valve covers, oil pan gasket, and timing chain covers. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil spots on the garage floor, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: The specific location of the leak needs to be identified and the corresponding gasket or seal replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the leak location and labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Individual coil packs can fail, leading to a misfire and rough running engine. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough idle, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (per coil pack, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed E-Gear (Automated Manual)**

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E-Gear transmission uses a single clutch, which is prone to wear and eventual failure, especially with aggressive driving or frequent stop-and-go traffic. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty engaging gears, and eventual inability to drive the car.
    *   Solution: The clutch needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ (includes clutch kit, labor, and potentially other related components)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E-Gear system relies on a hydraulic pump to operate the clutch and gear changes. The pump can fail due to wear or electrical issues. Symptoms include slow or jerky gear changes, inability to select gears, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (includes pump, labor, and potentially related components)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Actuator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E-Gear system uses actuators to engage the gears. These actuators can wear out or fail, leading to difficulty selecting gears or incorrect gear selection. Symptoms include erratic gear changes, inability to shift, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the faulty actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the actuator and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lift System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some Murcielagos are equipped with a front lift system to raise the front of the car for clearing obstacles. This system can fail due to hydraulic leaks, pump failure, or control module issues. Symptoms include the front not raising when activated or raising very slowly.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific issue (hydraulic leak, pump failure, control module) and repair or replace the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the component and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Murcielago can suffer from battery drain issues, especially if left sitting for extended periods. This can be due to a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the parasitic draw and address it. This may involve replacing faulty components or rewiring. A battery tender is recommended for extended storage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **ECU Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The ECU can have internal failures that causes the car to go into limp mode or prevents it from starting.
    * Solution: Replace or reprogram the ECU.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation can build up inside the headlight housings, especially in humid climates. This can reduce visibility and potentially damage the headlights.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlights, dry them thoroughly, and reseal them. Ensure the vent is properly installed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on the labor and any parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: On some Murcielagos, the soft-touch coating on interior trim pieces (e.g., center console, door handles) can become sticky and degrade over time, particularly in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Remove the affected trim pieces and either refinish them or replace them. Refinishing involves stripping the old coating and applying a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the number of pieces and whether they are refinished or replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Lamborghini Murcielago is a high-performance exotic with inherent maintenance considerations. The most significant potential issues revolve around the E-Gear transmission, specifically clutch wear and hydraulic system problems. Engine oil leaks and electrical issues are also common concerns. While these repairs can be costly, addressing them proactively can help maintain the car's value and performance. The severity and cost of repairs can vary greatly depending on the car's condition, mileage, and driving history. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the car and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified Lamborghini technician.
