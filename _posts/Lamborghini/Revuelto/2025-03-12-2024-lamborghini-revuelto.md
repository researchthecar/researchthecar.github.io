The 2024 Lamborghini Revuelto is a plug-in hybrid supercar, marking a new era for Lamborghini. It boasts a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine paired with three electric motors, delivering a combined output of 1001 horsepower and 535 lb-ft of torque. This powertrain is coupled with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. Praised for its breathtaking performance, striking design, and advanced technology, the Revuelto is also criticized for its high price tag and potential complexities associated with its hybrid powertrain. Since this is a new model, reported issues are still emerging.

**Summary:**

The 2024 Lamborghini Revuelto, while highly desirable, presents some early issues that owners are facing. Many of these issues are software related, as is common in many modern vehicles. These issues are generally less concerning because they are often fixed with software updates and fall under warranty. Some owners have reported mechanical issues such as fuel injector and transmission problems that could be a much larger repair bill if not covered under warranty. As the Revuelto continues to be produced, more issues may arise and could lead to recalls in the future.
