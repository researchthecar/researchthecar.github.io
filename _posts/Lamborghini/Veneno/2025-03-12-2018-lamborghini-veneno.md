The Lamborghini Veneno is an extremely rare and exclusive hypercar produced in very limited numbers. The 2018 model features a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine producing 740 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque. Only one engine and transmission option was offered. The Veneno is praised for its aggressive styling and extreme performance, delivering blistering acceleration and track-focused handling. It is disliked by some for its impracticality, limited visibility, and extremely high price tag. Due to the limited production numbers of this vehicle, data on common issues and complaints is very scarce. This information is compiled from limited owner reports and general knowledge of Lamborghini V12 engines and related components.

**Engine**

**6.5L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may develop from various locations on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and potentially around the timing chain cover. Visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil level are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets and seals is necessary. Thorough cleaning of the engine bay after the repair is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the source and location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur at hose connections, water pump gasket, or radiator. Symptoms include visible coolant pooling under the vehicle, low coolant level, and overheating.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty hose, gasket, or water pump is the necessary repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed ISR Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The single-clutch ISR transmission can experience premature clutch wear, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty engaging gears, and jerky shifts.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is required. Inspection of the clutch actuator and flywheel is recommended during the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $15,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Actuator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electro-hydraulic actuators that control gear changes in the ISR transmission can develop faults. Symptoms include delayed or missed shifts, transmission error messages, and inability to select gears.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of the faulty actuator(s) is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as ABS sensors, throttle position sensors, and mass airflow sensors, can fail. Symptoms vary depending on the affected sensor and can include warning lights, poor engine performance, and transmission issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Carbon Fiber Delamination/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the extensive use of carbon fiber in the body panels, delamination or cracking can occur, especially in areas exposed to high stress or UV radiation.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the affected carbon fiber panel is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $30,000+ depending on the panel and severity of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may experience glitches, freezing, or failure to respond to inputs.
    * Solution: Software updates or component replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Lamborghini Veneno, due to its limited production and exclusive nature, has a sparse documented history of common issues. However, based on general Lamborghini V12 characteristics and the complexities of the ISR transmission, potential owners should be aware of potential issues related to oil leaks, clutch wear, and carbon fiber panel integrity. The cost to repair these issues can be very high, reflecting the exotic nature of the vehicle and its components. Overall the most common issue among owners is the high cost to fix most issues.
