Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2001 Lamborghini Diablo, categorized as requested.

The 2001 Lamborghini Diablo represents the final year of production for this iconic supercar. It's powered by a 6.0L V12 engine producing approximately 550 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. A key appeal is its aggressive styling, raw driving experience, and V12 engine. Common complaints include high maintenance costs, challenging drivability, and limited practicality. There are no other engine or transmission options available.
