## 1993 Lamborghini Diablo

The 1993 Lamborghini Diablo is a mid-engined sports car manufactured by Lamborghini. It was the successor to the Lamborghini Countach and was produced from 1990 to 2001. The Diablo was powered by a 5.7-liter V12 engine and was available with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.

The Diablo was a popular car, but it was also known for its reliability issues. Some of the most common problems with the Diablo include:

**Engine**

* **Valve stem seal failure:** The valve stem seals can fail, causing oil to leak into the combustion chamber. This can lead to smoking, engine damage, and decreased performance.
* **Camshaft failure:** The camshafts can fail, causing the engine to lose power and misfire.
* **Piston ring failure:** The piston rings can fail, causing the engine to burn oil and lose compression.

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual**

* **Synchro failure:** The synchros can fail, making it difficult to shift gears.
* **Clutch failure:** The clutch can fail, causing the car to lose power.

**4-speed Automatic**
