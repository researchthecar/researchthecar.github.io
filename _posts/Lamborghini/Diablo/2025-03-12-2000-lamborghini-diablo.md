The 2000 Lamborghini Diablo marked the end of an era for the model, representing a culmination of its development. Offered with a powerful 5.9L V12 engine producing around 550 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, the Diablo was a raw and visceral supercar experience. Owners often praise its iconic wedge shape, stunning performance, and the sheer presence it commands. Common complaints often revolve around its challenging driving dynamics, high maintenance costs, and the temperamental nature of certain components due to its age and complex systems.
