**Transmission**

**6-Speed E-Gear Automated Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, jerky shifting, and a "clutch worn" warning light. Premature clutch wear is a common issue, especially with aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch assembly. The clutch wear can be checked via the diagnostic computer.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+, including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E-gear system relies on a hydraulic pump to actuate the gear changes. If the pump fails, the transmission may not shift properly, or at all. Warning lights may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+, including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Actuator Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: The system uses actuators to physically change the gears within the transmission. These actuators can fail and cause the transmission to perform erratic shifts and fail to engage the desired gear.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the faulty actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
