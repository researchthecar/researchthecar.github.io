The 2005 Lamborghini Gallardo, a mid-engine sports car, marked a significant entry point for Lamborghini into a new market segment. It came equipped with a 5.0-liter V10 engine, producing around 493 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Available transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed E-gear automated manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Gallardo for its striking design, exhilarating performance, and relatively user-friendly nature compared to previous Lamborghini models. Some common complaints often cited are the cost of maintenance, the sometimes jarring experience of the E-gear transmission, and limited visibility.
