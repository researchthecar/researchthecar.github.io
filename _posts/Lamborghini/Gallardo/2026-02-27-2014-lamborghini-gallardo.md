### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Lamborghini Gallardo is a highly desirable supercar with a generally strong reliability record for its class. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the complex E-gear transmission system, particularly the hydraulic pump and clutch actuator, and occasional electrical gremlins within the infotainment system. Engine-wise, the robust V10 is largely dependable, though oil and coolant leaks can occur. The manual transmission variant offers a simpler, more reliable drivetrain. While not immune to issues, most problems are repairable and not indicative of fundamental design flaws. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for preserving the Gallardo's performance and reliability.
