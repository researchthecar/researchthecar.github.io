Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2018 Lamborghini Centenario, structured as requested.

The 2018 Lamborghini Centenario is a limited-edition supercar celebrating the 100th birthday of Ferruccio Lamborghini. Only 20 coupes and 20 roadsters were produced. It boasts a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine producing 759 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 7-speed Independent Shifting Rod (ISR) transmission. Owners often praise its aggressive styling, exclusivity, and exhilarating performance. Common complaints, when they exist, tend to focus on the harsh ride quality, limited practicality due to its low ground clearance, and high maintenance costs inherent to such a specialized vehicle. There are no other engine or transmission options available for the 2018 Centenario.

**Engine**

**6.5L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets on the engine, leading to visible oil spots and potential low oil levels. Common areas include valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, and oil pan gasket.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals. Thorough cleaning of the engine bay is recommended after the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Centenario's high-performance engine can be susceptible to overheating, especially in hot climates or during demanding driving conditions. Symptoms include rising temperature gauge, steam from the engine bay, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and replacing the thermostat, water pump, radiator hoses, and radiator itself. Ensuring proper coolant levels and a functioning cooling fan system is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+ depending on what failed in the cooling system.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed ISR (Independent Shifting Rod)**

*   **Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ISR transmission, while offering fast shift times, can exhibit jerky or abrupt shifts, particularly at lower speeds. This can be exacerbated by worn clutch components.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement may be necessary. Recalibrating the transmission control unit (TCU) can also improve shift quality.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $15,000+ depending on the extent of the work and if the clutch needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Control Unit (TCU) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions within the TCU can lead to various transmission problems, including failure to shift, erratic shifting behavior, and error codes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the TCU with specialized diagnostic equipment. Replacement of the TCU may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $10,000+ depending on what failed and if the entire transmission needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Centenario utilizes an air suspension system, which can develop leaks in the air struts or lines. Symptoms include a sagging vehicle, uneven ride height, and a malfunctioning air compressor.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and replacing the leaking air struts, lines, or compressor. Calibrating the suspension system after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $10,000+ depending on the failed part and the amount of labor required to repair the part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A variety of sensors throughout the vehicle (e.g., oxygen sensors, ABS sensors, etc.) can fail, triggering warning lights and affecting vehicle performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor with diagnostic equipment. Replacement of the sensor is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the sensor and ease of access.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or unresponsiveness.
    *   Solution: Software updates, or replacement of the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Spoiler Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Centenario has an automatic rear spoiler that can sometimes have issues deploying or retracting properly.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace the spoiler motor or the hydraulic lift mechanism. Ensure all the components are properly lubricated and functioning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the failed component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2018 Lamborghini Centenario, while a remarkable feat of engineering and design, can experience issues common to high-performance vehicles. Engine oil leaks and potential overheating pose significant concerns, while the transmission can exhibit jerky shifting and TCU malfunctions. The air suspension can also be problematic. The cost of repairs can range from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars, reflecting the specialized nature of the vehicle and its components. It is highly recommended to get a pre-purchase inspection to look for these issues.
