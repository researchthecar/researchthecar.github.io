The 2017 Lamborghini Centenario is an extremely limited-production supercar built to celebrate the 100th birthday of Ferruccio Lamborghini. All Centenarios were equipped with a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine producing 759 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 7-speed Independent Shifting Rod (ISR) automated manual transmission. Owners generally rave about the car's striking design, incredible performance, and exclusivity. Potential downsides include the high price tag, firm ride, and potential for expensive maintenance and repairs. This information is based on general knowledge and publicly available sources.

**Engine**

**6.5L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported minor oil leaks, particularly around the valve covers and oil pan. This can manifest as oil spots on the garage floor or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals is usually necessary. Retorquing fasteners is another option, if the gaskets are in good condition
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the location of the leak and the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from hoses, fittings, or the water pump. Symptoms include a low coolant warning light, visible coolant under the car, and overheating.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking hose, fitting, or water pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the specific issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed ISR Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the nature of automated manual transmissions and the Centenario's high performance, premature clutch wear can be an issue, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping during acceleration, difficulty shifting, and jerky engagement.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is necessary when it wears out.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ISR transmission relies on a hydraulic pump for actuation. Failures of this pump can lead to shifting problems or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Centenario utilizes an air suspension system. Problems can arise with the air struts, compressor, or control module. Symptoms include uneven ride height, failure to adjust height, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air strut, compressor, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ per component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the car (e.g., ABS sensors, oxygen sensors, tire pressure sensors) can fail, leading to warning lights on the dashboard and potentially affecting vehicle performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery, addressing parasitic draws, or using a battery tender.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Carbon Fiber Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Centenario features extensive use of carbon fiber. This material is prone to damage from impacts and scratches.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the damaged carbon fiber panel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $10,000+, depending on the severity and location of the damage. Carbon fiber repair can be very expensive.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience occasional glitches, such as freezing, slow response times, or connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates or replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The Lamborghini Centenario, while an exceptional vehicle, is not without its potential issues. The reported problems range from relatively minor oil leaks and sensor failures to more significant concerns with the transmission, air suspension, and carbon fiber bodywork. Due to the limited production and exotic nature of the car, repairs can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the high maintenance costs associated with owning such a rare and high-performance vehicle.
