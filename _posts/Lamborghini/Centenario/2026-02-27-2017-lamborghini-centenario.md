# 2017 Lamborghini Centenario

### Overview
The 2017 Lamborghini Centenario is an ultra-exclusive hypercar, produced in very limited numbers to celebrate the 100th birthday of Ferruccio Lamborghini. As such, it is built to an exceptionally high standard, utilizing advanced materials and cutting-edge engineering. Reliability data for such a rare vehicle is scarce, as most examples are meticulously maintained by owners and specialized technicians. The focus is on extreme performance and bespoke craftsmanship rather than mass-market durability. However, given its development from proven Lamborghini V12 architecture and extensive testing, major widespread mechanical failures are not anticipated. Owners should expect the highest levels of performance and a unique ownership experience, with any potential issues likely to be isolated and addressed through specialized service.
