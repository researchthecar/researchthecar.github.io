The 2024 Jeep Gladiator is a mid-size pickup truck known for its off-road capabilities and removable top and doors, appealing to enthusiasts seeking an adventurous driving experience. The Gladiator comes standard with a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine that delivers 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. A 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 producing 260 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque was available, but it has been discontinued for the 2024 model year. The 3.6L engine is paired with either a standard 6-speed manual transmission or an optional 8-speed automatic transmission. People appreciate the Gladiator's rugged design, open-air driving experience, and its ability to tackle challenging terrains. Conversely, common criticisms include its higher price point compared to other mid-size trucks, its lower fuel economy, and the potential for a less refined ride on paved roads.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: There isn't a single, universally accepted fix. Some dealerships recommend performing an oil consumption test to determine the extent of the issue. Depending on the results, potential solutions could range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive engine work such as piston ring replacement or even engine replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve) to $3,000+ (Engine Replacement)

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some Gladiator owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifts, particularly when the transmission is cold. The transmission may hesitate before engaging a gear, or shift roughly, causing a noticeable jolt.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) might resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a transmission fluid flush and filter change, or valve body replacement may be necessary. In more severe cases, complete transmission replacement may be needed.
