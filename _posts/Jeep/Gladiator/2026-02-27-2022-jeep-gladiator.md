### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Jeep Gladiator demonstrates commendable reliability, especially with its standard 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine and both transmission options, which show no significant widespread issues. The diesel variant, however, presents potential concerns related to its Diesel Particulate Filter and AdBlue/DEF system, common to many modern diesel powertrains. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Uconnect infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are the most frequently cited non-routine problems. Exterior and interior components generally hold up well, aligning with the Gladiator's rugged persona. Overall, for those opting for the gasoline engine, the Gladiator offers a dependable platform, while diesel owners should be aware of potential emissions system maintenance.
