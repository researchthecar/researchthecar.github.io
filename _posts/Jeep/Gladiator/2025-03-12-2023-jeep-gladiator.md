The 2023 Jeep Gladiator is a mid-size pickup truck known for its off-road capabilities and open-air driving experience, thanks to its removable roof and doors. The Gladiator comes standard with a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine producing 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. A 3.0L EcoDiesel V6, delivering 260 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque, is also available, exclusively with the 8-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Gladiator's unique styling, off-road prowess, and the utility of a truck bed. However, some common complaints include a stiff ride, wind noise at highway speeds, and fuel economy.
