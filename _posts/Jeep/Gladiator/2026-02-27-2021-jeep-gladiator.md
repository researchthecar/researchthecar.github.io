The optional EcoDiesel engine introduces potential DPF and DEF system concerns, which are common in modern diesel powertrains. Electrical issues, particularly with the Uconnect infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Manual transmission models may experience clutch wear over time. For the most part, the Gladiator is a dependable choice, but owners of the diesel variant should be aware of its specific maintenance needs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are key to ensuring long-term reliability.
