The 2022 Jeep Gladiator is a mid-size pickup truck that offers a unique blend of off-road capability and open-air driving. Engine options include a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 that generates 260 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque. The V6 is paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the EcoDiesel only comes with the 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Gladiator for its distinctive styling, removable top and doors, and impressive off-road prowess. However, some common complaints include its relatively high price, firm ride, and compromised fuel economy.

**Summary**

The 2022 Jeep Gladiator, while celebrated for its unique features, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems can range from relatively minor oil cooler leaks to more serious fuel injector failures in the EcoDiesel engine, potentially incurring significant repair costs. Transmission issues, particularly with the 8-speed automatic, can also lead to expensive repairs. The "death wobble" suspension problem is concerning for its potential impact on safety. Electrical glitches and Uconnect issues are also prevalent. Overall, while some issues are minor annoyances, others can be costly and potentially affect the vehicle's reliability. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are recommended.
