The 2021 Jeep Gladiator is a mid-size pickup truck that blends Jeep's iconic off-road capability with truck utility. It's available with two engine options: a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 generating 260 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque. The 3.6L V6 is paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L EcoDiesel is only offered with an 8-speed automatic. People love the Gladiator for its open-air driving experience (removable top and doors), rugged styling, and excellent off-road prowess. Common complaints often revolve around its ride quality, fuel economy (especially with the V6), and price point.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and visible exhaust smoke (though less common).
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. In severe cases, dealerships may perform an oil consumption test to determine if a component replacement is necessary. Some cases require the replacement of piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Tick/Knock Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or knocking noise emanating from the engine, particularly at idle or low speeds. The noise may be more pronounced when the engine is cold.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is essential to pinpoint the exact cause. Potential culprits include valve train components, exhaust manifold leaks, or even internal engine issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on the source of the noise and required repairs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L EcoDiesel V6**

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported fuel injector failures, leading to rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel injector performance.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s). A complete diagnostic assessment is recommended to ensure all affected injectors are addressed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Glow Plug Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult starting, especially in cold weather, can indicate a problem with the glow plugs. Other symptoms include rough idling and excessive white smoke on startup.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty glow plug(s) and control module, if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the number of glow plugs replaced and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or jerky shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation during acceleration is also a reported symptom.
    * Solution: Dealerships may perform a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) to address shifting issues. In some cases, a transmission flush and filter change may be recommended. In more severe cases, valve body replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on the fix required.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Death Wobble**
    * Description/Symptoms: This is a violent shaking of the front end, particularly at highway speeds, often triggered by a bump or imperfection in the road.
    * Solution: The causes of death wobble can be multi-faceted, and the solution often involves replacing or upgrading multiple suspension components, including the steering damper (stabilizer), track bar, ball joints, and control arm bushings. Ensuring proper tire balancing and alignment is also crucial.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the components that need replacing.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **ESS (Engine Start/Stop) System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The ESS system may fail to function properly, displaying error messages on the instrument cluster. The engine may not shut off automatically at stoplights or may fail to restart.
    * Solution: The dealership will need to diagnose the issue. Common causes include a weak auxiliary battery, faulty sensors, or software glitches. Replacement of the auxiliary battery or other components may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause and the parts replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Uconnect System Freezing/Rebooting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot while driving.
    * Solution: Software updates are often released to address Uconnect glitches. Performing a system reset or visiting the dealership for a software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, hardware replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software updates) - $1000+ (hardware replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Leaking Freedom Top**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water leaks through the seams of the removable Freedom Top, particularly during heavy rain or car washes.
    * Solution: Re-sealing the top panels, replacing weather stripping, or adjusting the panel alignment.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling/Creaking Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive rattling or creaking noises emanating from the dashboard, doors, or other interior components, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    * Solution: Tightening loose fasteners, adding sound-deadening material, or replacing worn trim pieces. Pinpointing the exact source of the noise can be challenging.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the source and the repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Jeep Gladiator, while a highly desirable vehicle, does have its share of potential issues. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely. Engine problems, such as excessive oil consumption and fuel injector failures, can be costly to repair. The infamous "death wobble" in the suspension can create major drivability problems. Electrical glitches with the ESS system and Uconnect infotainment system can also be frustrating. While some issues can be resolved with relatively inexpensive fixes, others may require significant investment. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect any used Gladiator before purchasing.
