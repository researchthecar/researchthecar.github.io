### Summary Verdict
The 2023 Jeep Wagoneer demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its more powerful 6.4L HEMI engine and standard suspension. However, owners may encounter specific issues related to the 5.7L HEMI's eTorque system, potential hesitations in the 8-speed automatic transmission, and occasional problems with the adaptive air suspension's air leaks. Electrical gremlins, primarily concerning the infotainment system's responsiveness and premature 12V battery failure, are also noted. While these issues are not universal, they represent the most frequently reported technical concerns. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are advised to mitigate potential problems and ensure a smooth ownership experience.
