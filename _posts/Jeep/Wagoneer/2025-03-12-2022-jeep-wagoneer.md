The 2022 Jeep Wagoneer marks the return of the iconic nameplate as a full-size SUV, offering a blend of luxury, capability, and spaciousness. It offers a premium alternative to more mainstream SUVs. Consumers tend to enjoy the Wagoneer's smooth ride, comfortable and upscale interior, and powerful engine options. However, some common complaints revolve around its large size, fuel economy, and the complexity of the infotainment system. The available engines for the 2022 Wagoneer include a 5.7L V8 with eTorque mild-hybrid assist, producing 392 horsepower and 404 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L twin-turbo inline-6 Hurricane engine, which came later in the model year, producing 420 horsepower and 486 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**5.7L V8 eTorque**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or tapping noise emanating from the engine, particularly when idling or at low speeds. This is often attributed to valvetrain components, such as the hydraulic lifters or exhaust manifold bolts. Some owners report the noise worsening over time.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the faulty lifters, exhaust manifold bolts or performing an engine flush may resolve the ticking noise. In more severe cases, a more comprehensive engine repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ETorque System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic engine behavior, difficulty starting, error messages related to the 48-volt eTorque system, and potential loss of mild-hybrid functionality (auto stop/start).
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is crucial. This could involve software updates, replacement of the eTorque generator, or addressing issues within the 48-volt battery system.
