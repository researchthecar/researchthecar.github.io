**Introduction to the 1991 Jeep Comanche**

The 1991 Jeep Comanche is a compact pickup truck that was produced from 1986 to 1992. It is based on the Cherokee SUV and was offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. Popular engine choices include the 2.5L inline-4, 4.0L inline-6, and 2.1L turbo-diesel inline-4. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 3-speed automatic, and 4-speed automatic.

Owners generally appreciate the Comanche's rugged design, off-road capabilities, and relatively affordable price. However, it has been criticized for its lack of interior space, limited towing capacity, and dated technology.
