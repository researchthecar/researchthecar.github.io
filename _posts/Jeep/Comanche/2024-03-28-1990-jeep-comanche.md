**Introduction:**
The 1990 Jeep Comanche is a compact pickup truck that was produced from 1986 to 1992. It is powered by a standard 2.5L inline-4 engine producing 117 horsepower and 138 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission. Optional engine choices include a 4.0L inline-6 engine with 177 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission.
