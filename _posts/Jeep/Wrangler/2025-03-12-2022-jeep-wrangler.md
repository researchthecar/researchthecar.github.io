The 2022 Jeep Wrangler is a rugged and iconic off-road vehicle beloved for its removable doors and roof, solid axles, and go-anywhere capability. It comes with several engine options, including a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (270 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L Pentastar V6 (285 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 (260 hp, 442 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.4L Hemi V8 (470 hp, 470 lb-ft of torque). There's also the 4xe plug-in hybrid version, which combines the 2.0L turbo engine with electric motors. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (V6 only) and an 8-speed automatic. Owners praise the Wrangler's off-road prowess and customizable nature, but often cite its on-road handling, fuel economy, and wind noise as drawbacks.
