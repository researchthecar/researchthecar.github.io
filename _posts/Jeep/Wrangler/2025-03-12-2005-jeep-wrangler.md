The 2005 Jeep Wrangler TJ is a popular off-road vehicle known for its ruggedness and simplicity. Engine options included the 2.4L inline-4 (147 hp, 165 lb-ft torque) and the more popular 4.0L inline-6 (190 hp, 235 lb-ft torque). Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Wrangler's off-road capability, open-air driving experience, and aftermarket support. However, some common complaints include a rough ride, limited cargo space, and susceptibility to rust.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, often originating from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. In severe cases, the entire oil pan or rear main seal carrier may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall, run erratically, or fail to start. A check engine light will typically illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.0L Inline-6**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue is cracking of the exhaust manifold, often near the collector. Symptoms include a ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked exhaust manifold. Many owners opt for aftermarket headers for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.4L, oil leaks are prevalent, particularly from the valve cover gasket, oil filter adapter, and rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. The oil filter adapter can also be a source of leaks and may require a new adapter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine temperature gauge reads high, steam may be visible, and the engine may lose power or stall.
    *   Solution: Investigate and repair the cooling system. Common causes include a faulty thermostat, a clogged radiator, a failing water pump, or a leaking coolant hose.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the cause.

**Transmission**

**NSG370 6-Speed Manual**
* **Shift Fork Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting into certain gears, grinding noises during gear changes.
    * Solution: Replace worn shift forks and potentially damaged gears or synchronizers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**42RLE 4-Speed Automatic**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting into or maintaining overdrive, slipping in overdrive, or harsh shifting.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is key. Could involve replacing the overdrive solenoid pack, valve body, or even a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2500+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Cooler Line Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid leaks, often near the radiator or transmission, causing low fluid levels and potential transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking transmission cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Death Wobble**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A violent shaking of the front end, typically occurring at speeds above 45 mph. This is a common and potentially dangerous issue.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair are crucial. Potential causes include worn steering components (tie rod ends, ball joints, track bar), loose control arm bushings, unbalanced tires, and improper alignment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the components needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose or clunking noises from the front end, especially when going over bumps or turning. Poor handling and steering wander.

**Summary**

The 2005 Jeep Wrangler TJ has several common issues, ranging from relatively minor (oil leaks, blend door actuator) to more serious (death wobble, frame rust). Engine issues are common for both the 2.4L and 4.0L, with oil leaks and exhaust manifold cracks being prevalent. The 42RLE automatic transmission can suffer from overdrive problems. Suspension issues like "death wobble" require prompt attention due to safety concerns. Frame rust is a significant concern in regions with road salt usage. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the severity of the problem and whether the owner chooses to perform the work themselves or hire a mechanic. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for rust, test drive it thoroughly, and be prepared to address common issues to keep their Wrangler in good condition.
