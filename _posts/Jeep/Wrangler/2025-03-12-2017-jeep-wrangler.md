**Summary:**

The 2017 Jeep Wrangler JK, while beloved for its off-road prowess and iconic design, does have some common issues. The oil cooler leaks and potential for camshaft/rocker arm wear in the 3.6L engine are significant concerns. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the TIPM and clock spring, can also be costly to address. The "death wobble" remains a persistent and potentially dangerous issue that requires careful diagnosis and repair. The water leaks can lead to mold issues, and can be costly depending on if the top or seals need to be replaced. Overall, while these issues aren't present in every Wrangler, potential buyers should be aware of them and factor in potential repair costs. The severity ranges from minor annoyances to safety-related concerns, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the issue and the shop performing the work.
