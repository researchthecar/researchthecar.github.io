**Summary:**

The 2002 Jeep Wrangler is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems like cracked exhaust manifolds and oil leaks are fairly common and can range from relatively inexpensive to moderately expensive to repair. Suspension issues, particularly the "death wobble," can be serious and costly to fix. Frame rust is a significant concern, especially in areas where road salt is used, and can lead to very expensive repairs. While some issues are more of an annoyance, others, like frame rust and death wobble, can impact the safety and drivability of the vehicle. Addressing these problems promptly is crucial to maintaining the Wrangler's reliability and longevity.
