### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Jeep Wrangler is a generally robust vehicle, with its 3.6L Pentastar engine and manual transmission proving to be reliable workhorses. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the suspension, particularly the 'death wobble' phenomenon, which often stems from worn steering and suspension components. Electrical gremlins, such as TIPM failures and window regulator issues, are also noted concerns. Exterior components like soft top seals can degrade over time, leading to leaks. While interior issues are less frequently reported as major technical failures, owners should be aware of potential suspension and electrical system vulnerabilities. Proactive inspection and maintenance of steering and suspension parts are recommended, especially for vehicles used off-road or with higher mileage.
