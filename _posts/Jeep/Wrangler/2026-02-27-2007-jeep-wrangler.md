## Engine

### 3.8L V6 (202 cu in)
**Oil Cooler Line Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Leaking oil, often noticeable on the driveway or engine bay. Can lead to low oil levels if not addressed.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the oil cooler line assembly.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Vacuum leaks, rough idle, potential coolant loss, and check engine light.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Transmission

### 6-Speed Manual Transmission
**Clutch Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, grinding noises, or a spongy clutch pedal.
- **Solution:** Clutch replacement (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $700 - $1200


### 4-Speed Automatic Transmission
**Overheating**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission slipping, delayed shifting, or burning smell. Can be exacerbated by heavy towing or off-roading.
- **Solution:** Installation of an auxiliary transmission cooler, fluid flush, and potential internal repairs.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1500


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Death Wobble**
- **Symptoms:** Violent shaking of the steering wheel and front end, typically after hitting a bump or during braking at speed. Often related to worn steering/suspension components.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of worn components such as track bar, ball joints, tie rod ends, and steering stabilizer.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1500+

**Worn Ball Joints**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises, steering looseness, uneven tire wear, and potential for wheel to detach if severely worn.
- **Solution:** Replacement of ball joints.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Various electrical components malfunctioning intermittently, such as power windows, locks, interior lights, or dashboard warnings.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000


### TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module)
**Fuel Pump Relay Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Engine cranks but won't start, often due to a faulty fuel pump relay integrated into the TIPM.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the TIPM or repair of the relay if possible.
- **Cost:** $600 - $1200


## Exterior

### Body Panels & Seals
**Water Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Water ingress into the cabin, particularly around the windshield, doors, and hardtop seals.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of seals, or repair of body seams.
- **Cost:** $100 - $500


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blend Door Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Inability to control temperature or direct airflow (e.g., stuck on defrost). Clicking or grinding noise from the dashboard.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blend door actuator.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400

### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Jeep Wrangler JK, while a capable and iconic vehicle, exhibits some common issues that owners should be aware of. The 3.8L V6 engine can experience oil cooler line and intake manifold gasket leaks. Both manual and automatic transmissions have reported issues, with the manual facing clutch problems and the automatic susceptible to overheating. The suspension is prone to 'death wobble' and worn ball joints, common in solid axle vehicles. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and TIPM, can cause a range of frustrating problems. Water leaks from seals and interior HVAC blend door actuator failures are also noted. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the Wrangler's off-road capabilities and ruggedness outweigh these concerns, especially with proactive maintenance and timely repairs.
