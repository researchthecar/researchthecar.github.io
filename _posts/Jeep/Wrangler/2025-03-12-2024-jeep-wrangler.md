The 2024 Jeep Wrangler continues the Wrangler's legacy as an iconic off-road vehicle, appreciated for its removable top and doors, solid front and rear axles, and robust 4x4 system. It offers a range of engine options, including a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (270 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L Pentastar V6 (285 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 (260 hp, 442 lb-ft of torque), and a 4xe Plug-in Hybrid (375 hp, 470 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (primarily with the V6) and an 8-speed automatic. While praised for its off-road prowess and distinctive styling, the Wrangler often faces criticisms regarding its on-road handling, fuel economy, and interior refinement compared to other SUVs.

**Summary**

The 2024 Jeep Wrangler, while maintaining its off-road appeal, has reported issues related to electrical systems, exterior sealing, interior noises, and suspension components. The 2.0L engine has potential turbocharger issues. The 8-speed automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting, but that is the only transmission issue. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences like rattles to more significant concerns involving the ESS system or transmission performance.
