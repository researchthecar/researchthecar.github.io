### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Jeep Wrangler is a robust vehicle with a strong reputation for off-road capability. While it's not immune to issues, most common problems are well-documented and often related to age and mileage, particularly concerning rust and certain engine/transmission components. The 4.0L inline-six engine is generally reliable but can develop oil leaks or, less commonly, cracked heads. Automatic transmissions may experience slipping. Suspension components like bushings and leaf springs are common wear items. Electrical gremlins and interior wear are also possibilities. With diligent maintenance and addressing these potential issues, the 2005 Wrangler can remain a dependable and enjoyable vehicle for its intended purpose.
