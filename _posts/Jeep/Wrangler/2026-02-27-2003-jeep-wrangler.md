### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Jeep Wrangler, particularly models equipped with the 4.0L inline-six engine, is known for its robust off-road capability but can be susceptible to specific mechanical and electrical issues. Common problems include engine oil leaks and potential head gasket failures on the 4.0L, and transmission issues like slipping gears on the 42RLE automatic. Rust is a significant concern for the exterior, especially on the frame and body. Electrical gremlins, such as WCM failures and instrument cluster problems, can also arise. While many issues are repairable, potential buyers should be aware of these common failure points and factor in potential repair costs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the reliability of a 2003 Wrangler.
