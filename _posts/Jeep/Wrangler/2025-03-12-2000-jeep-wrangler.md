The 2000 Jeep Wrangler (TJ) is a beloved off-road vehicle known for its ruggedness, simplicity, and iconic design. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 engine producing 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 4.0L inline-6 engine producing 190 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 3-speed automatic (32RH) and a 5-speed manual (AX-15). What people love about the TJ Wrangler is its off-road capability, removable doors and top, and the sense of freedom it provides. Common complaints include the relatively low fuel economy, wind noise at higher speeds, and the somewhat cramped interior, particularly in the rear.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks commonly originate from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $250+ depending on the location of the leak.
