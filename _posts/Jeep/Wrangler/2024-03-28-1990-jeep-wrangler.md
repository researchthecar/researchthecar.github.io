**Introduction:**

The 1990 Jeep Wrangler is an iconic off-road vehicle that embodies the spirit of rugged adventure. Its boxy design, solid build, and off-road capabilities have made it a popular choice among enthusiasts. The Wrangler came with a variety of engine and transmission options, including a 2.5L inline-4 and a 4.0L inline-6 engine, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic transmission. Despite its immense popularity, the 1990 Jeep Wrangler has been plagued by various issues over the years.
