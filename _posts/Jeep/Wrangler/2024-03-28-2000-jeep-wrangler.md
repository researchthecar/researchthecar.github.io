**Introduction**

The 2000 Jeep Wrangler is a midsize SUV known for its rugged off-road capabilities. It was available with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 125 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L inline-6 producing 181 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 4-speed automatic transmission.

People who like the Wrangler appreciate its off-road prowess, iconic design, and removable doors and roof panels. Common complaints include poor on-road handling, a cramped interior, and limited storage space.
