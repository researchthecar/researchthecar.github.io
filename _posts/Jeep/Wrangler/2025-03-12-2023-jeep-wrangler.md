The 2023 Jeep Wrangler is a rugged and iconic off-road vehicle known for its removable top and doors, solid axles, and impressive capability. Engine options include a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (270 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L Pentastar V6 (285 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 (260 hp, 442 lb-ft of torque, available on some models), and a 6.4L HEMI V8 (470 hp, 470 lb-ft of torque, available on the Rubicon 392). Transmission choices consist of a 6-speed manual (primarily with the V6) and an 8-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Wrangler's off-road prowess, open-air experience, and distinctive styling. Common dislikes include its compromised on-road handling, fuel economy, and cabin noise.
