### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Jeep Wrangler is a durable vehicle, particularly known for its robust 4.0L inline-six engine. However, common issues to be aware of include potential cylinder head cracks on both engine options, oil leaks, and specific transmission problems depending on the unit. Suspension components like control arm bushings and leaf springs can wear out, and rust is a significant concern, especially on the frame and body, due to its off-road nature and age. Electrical gremlins, such as a worn clock spring, are also noted. Despite these potential issues, with proper maintenance and addressing known problems, the 2001 Wrangler remains a capable and enjoyable off-road machine.
