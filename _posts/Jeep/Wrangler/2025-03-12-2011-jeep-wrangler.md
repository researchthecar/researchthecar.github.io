The 2011 Jeep Wrangler is a rugged and iconic off-road vehicle known for its distinctive styling, solid front and rear axles, and removable top and doors.

Transmission choices included a 6-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2011 Jeep Wrangler can be a fun and capable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The 3.8L engine is prone to oil consumption. The 4-speed automatic transmission can suffer from torque converter issues. The "death wobble" and other suspension problems can be dangerous and costly to repair, especially if neglected. Electrical issues related to the TIPM can also be a significant expense. While not every Wrangler will experience these problems, a thorough inspection and understanding of these potential issues is recommended before purchasing a used 2011 model.
