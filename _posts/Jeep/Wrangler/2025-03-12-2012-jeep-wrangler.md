The 2012 Jeep Wrangler is a rugged and iconic vehicle known for its off-road capabilities and open-air driving experience. This model year came standard with a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine producing 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Wrangler's off-road prowess, customizable nature, and classic design. However, common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy, a less-than-refined ride quality, and wind noise at highway speeds.

**Suspension**

*   **Death Wobble**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Death Wobble" is a violent shaking of the front end, usually occurring at highway speeds after hitting a bump. It's caused by a combination of worn or loose suspension components, including ball joints, tie rod ends, track bar bushings, steering stabilizer, and wheel balance.

**Summary**

The 2012 Jeep Wrangler, while a capable and desirable vehicle, has some known issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for cylinder head failure on the 3.6L engine and TIPM failure that can cause a variety of electrical issues. The "Death Wobble" in the suspension is also a common problem that can be dangerous and costly to fix. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can also be expensive. Overall, while the Wrangler offers a unique driving experience, buyers should be prepared for potential repair costs and carefully inspect any used model before purchase. The TIPM recall should be checked to ensure the vehicle has had the repair completed.
