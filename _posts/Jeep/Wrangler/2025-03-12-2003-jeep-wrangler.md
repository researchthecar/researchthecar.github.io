The 2003 Jeep Wrangler TJ is a popular off-road vehicle known for its ruggedness, simple design, and removable top and doors. It offers a classic Jeep experience that many enthusiasts appreciate. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common problems. Owners often praise its off-road capabilities and open-air driving experience, but sometimes dislike the relatively poor fuel economy, road noise, and less refined on-road handling compared to modern SUVs. The 2003 Wrangler offered two engine options: the 2.5L inline-4 (120 hp, 140 lb-ft of torque) and the more powerful 4.0L inline-6 (190 hp, 235 lb-ft of torque). Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 3-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2003 Jeep Wrangler TJ, while a capable and enjoyable vehicle, is prone to certain issues due to its age and design. The most common problems involve engine oil leaks, exhaust manifold cracking, suspension components, rust, and electrical glitches. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs. Rust and "death wobble" can be particularly concerning and costly. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle for rust, test drive it at highway speeds to check for "death wobble," and have a mechanic inspect the engine and transmission before purchase. While many of these issues are manageable with regular maintenance and timely repairs, they should be considered when evaluating the overall cost of ownership.
