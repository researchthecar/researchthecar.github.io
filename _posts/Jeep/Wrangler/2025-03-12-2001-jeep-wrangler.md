The 2001 Jeep Wrangler TJ is a rugged and iconic off-road vehicle known for its simple design, solid front and rear axles, and removable top and doors. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-4 producing 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L inline-6 generating 190 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 3-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual. Owners often praise the Wrangler's off-road capability, open-air experience, and aftermarket support. Common complaints include a rough ride, limited cargo space, and relatively poor fuel economy.

**Summary**

The 2001 Jeep Wrangler TJ has a mix of common issues, ranging from relatively minor to potentially expensive. The 4.0L engine is generally reliable, but exhaust manifold cracking and oil leaks are common. The 2.5L engine suffers from cylinder head cracking. Suspension components such as ball joints and track bar bushings wear out over time, contributing to handling problems. Electrical issues, particularly with the clock spring and headlight switch, are also prevalent. Rust is a major concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, addressing significant rust or transmission problems can be costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for rust, listen for unusual engine or transmission noises, and check the functionality of all electrical components.
