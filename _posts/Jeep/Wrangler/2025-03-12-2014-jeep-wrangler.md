The 2014 Jeep Wrangler is a rugged and iconic off-road vehicle known for its capability and distinctive styling. Available in two-door Wrangler and four-door Wrangler Unlimited configurations, it appeals to those seeking adventure and open-air driving. The 2014 Wrangler is powered by a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine, producing 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. This engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners love the Wrangler for its off-road prowess, customization options, and open-air experience. However, some common complaints include wind noise, a relatively rough ride on pavement, and lower fuel economy compared to other SUVs.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Cooler Housing Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks originating from the oil cooler housing, often dripping onto the engine or ground. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage. The leak is due to the plastic construction of the oil cooler housing cracking or warping over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil cooler housing, often with an updated aluminum version for improved durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cylinder Head Issues (Early Production)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some early production 2014 Wranglers with the 3.6L engine experienced cylinder head issues, specifically with the left (driver's side) cylinder head. Symptoms include a check engine light, misfires, and rough idling. This was due to a manufacturing defect in the cylinder head casting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or harsh shifting, particularly between gears. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds or during acceleration. This can be caused by the transmission's valve body being worn, or a faulty solenoid.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can address the issue. However, more severe cases might require valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for software update, $500 - $1500+ for valve body, $2000 - $4000+ for rebuild
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Death Wobble**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Death wobble" is a severe shaking of the front end at highway speeds, most commonly triggered by hitting a bump or imperfection in the road. This issue is caused by a combination of factors, including worn steering components (ball joints, tie rod ends, track bar), improper tire balance, and loose bolts.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace any worn steering or suspension components, including ball joints, tie rod ends, track bar, and steering stabilizer. Ensure proper tire balancing and alignment. Properly torque all suspension bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls various electrical functions in the vehicle. Problems with the TIPM can manifest as intermittent starting problems, stalling, fuel pump issues, and malfunctioning accessories.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clock Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clock spring is located in the steering column and provides an electrical connection to the steering wheel's components, such as the airbag and horn. Failure can cause the airbag warning light to illuminate, the horn to stop working, and cruise control issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clock spring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Jeep Wrangler has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant issues include the oil cooler housing leak and potential cylinder head problems with the 3.6L engine, as well as the dreaded "death wobble" which can be caused by failing suspension components. Electrical issues, particularly related to the TIPM and clock spring, are also relatively common. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. While the Wrangler is a highly capable and desirable vehicle, thorough inspection and addressing these potential issues is recommended before purchase.
