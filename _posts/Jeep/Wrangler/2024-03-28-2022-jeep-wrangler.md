**2022 Jeep Wrangler**

The 2022 Jeep Wrangler is an iconic off-road SUV that combines rugged performance with modern features. It's available with three engine options: a 3.6L V6 (285 hp, 260 lb-ft), a 2.0L turbocharged inline-four (270 hp, 295 lb-ft), and a 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 (260 hp, 442 lb-ft). Transmission options include a six-speed manual, an eight-speed automatic, and a five-speed automatic (EcoDiesel only).

Despite its popularity, the Wrangler has faced criticism for its lack of refinement and poor fuel economy.
