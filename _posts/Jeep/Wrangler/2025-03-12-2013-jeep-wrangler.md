**Summary**

Suspension problems, like the dreaded "death wobble," are serious safety concerns. Electrical issues stemming from the TIPM are also prevalent and frustrating. Interior leaks add to the ownership experience challenges. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive repairs, others, like transmission problems or TIPM failures, can result in significant repair bills. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, and be prepared to inspect any prospective purchases carefully.
