The 2018 Jeep Wrangler JL marked a significant redesign, bringing with it both excitement and some teething problems. Engine options for the 2018 Wrangler included a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 making 270 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 producing 260 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic (different ratios for different engines). Owners generally appreciate the Wrangler's off-road capability, iconic styling, and open-air driving experience. However, common complaints revolve around ride quality, wind noise, fuel economy, and some reliability concerns. The 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 was first offered in the 2020 model year, so it is not present in the 2018 model year.
