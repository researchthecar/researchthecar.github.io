**Summary:**

The 2004 Jeep Wrangler, while iconic and capable, has its share of potential issues. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Engine issues vary depending on the engine chosen, but oil leaks (4.0L) and oil consumption (2.4L) are common. The 42RLE automatic transmission can suffer from shifting problems. Suspension issues, particularly death wobble, require diligent maintenance and inspection of suspension components. Clock spring failures can also occur and may affect the vehicle's safety systems. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like frame rust repair or transmission rebuilds, can be costly. Overall, a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
