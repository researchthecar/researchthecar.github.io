Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration. It's important to note that owner forums and initial quality reports provide insights, but long-term reliability data is still emerging for this model year. Also, keep in mind that issue prevalence can vary.

The 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee offers a blend of luxury and off-road capability. It comes with several engine options, including a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 293 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 PHEV system delivering 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L Hemi V8 producing 357 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Grand Cherokee for its comfortable ride, upscale interior (especially in higher trims), and advanced technology features. However, some criticisms include the complexity of the infotainment system, occasional build quality concerns, and fuel economy (particularly with the V8).

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported occasional engine misfires, particularly during cold starts or under heavy acceleration. Symptoms include rough idling, hesitation, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors, and performing a compression test. Replacement of faulty components is typically required.
