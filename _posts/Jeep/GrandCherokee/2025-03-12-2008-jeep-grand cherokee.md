The 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a mid-size SUV known for its off-road capability and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 3.7L V6 producing around 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, a 4.7L V8 generating approximately 305 horsepower and 334 lb-ft of torque, and a powerful 5.7L Hemi V8 delivering about 330 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque. There was also a diesel option. Most engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, with the exception of the diesel engine which used a Mercedes-Benz transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Grand Cherokee's ruggedness, towing capacity, and available luxury features. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy (especially with the V8 engines) and the reliability of certain electronic components and drivetrain parts.
