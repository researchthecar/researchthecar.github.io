### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee presents a mixed reliability profile. While the standard V6 and V8 engines are generally robust, they can experience issues like intake manifold or oil cooler leaks. The 3.0L EcoDiesel, though powerful, is more susceptible to complex and costly problems such as DPF and EGR cooler failures. The 8-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting or torque converter issues. The optional air suspension system is a notable weak point, with potential for leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Uconnect system and occasional battery drain, are also reported. Overall, the Grand Cherokee offers capability but requires diligent maintenance and awareness of potential powertrain and electronic vulnerabilities, especially with the diesel engine and air suspension.
