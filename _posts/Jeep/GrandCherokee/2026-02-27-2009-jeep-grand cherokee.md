### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee, particularly with the V8 engines, can be prone to significant repair costs related to engine and transmission issues, such as head gasket failures and transmission control module problems. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or TIPM, are also a notable concern. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods require attention as they age. While the exterior and interior have fewer widespread critical issues, HVAC and seat heater problems can arise. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect any vehicle for these common faults and factor potential repair costs into their ownership budget.
