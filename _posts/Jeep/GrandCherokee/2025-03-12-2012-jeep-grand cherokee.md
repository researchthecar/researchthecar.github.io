Common dislikes include reported issues with electrical components, and certain aspects of reliability.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Cylinder Head Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Certain 2012-2013 models, particularly those manufactured before June 2012, experienced cylinder head failures. Symptoms include a check engine light, misfires, rough idling, and ticking noises. The left-side cylinder head was the most commonly affected.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Cooler Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil cooler housing, which is made of plastic, is prone to cracking and leaking oil. This can lead to oil loss, engine overheating, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the oil cooler housing with an updated aluminum version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A distinct ticking noise emanating from the engine, often described as the "Hemi tick." The cause is debated, but it's often attributed to lifter issues, exhaust manifold leaks, or piston slap. While not always indicative of immediate failure, it can be concerning.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is key. Potential fixes range from exhaust manifold repair to lifter replacement or engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (exhaust manifold) - $5,000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts, leading to exhaust leaks and a noticeable ticking sound, especially when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts, often requiring professional extraction to avoid damaging the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Diesel V6**
*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (W5A580)**
*No Issues Found*

**6-Speed Automatic (65RFE)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh shifting, slipping between gears, and delayed engagement, particularly when shifting into reverse. Can be caused by valve body issues, solenoid failures, or wear in the transmission internals.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is essential. May require valve body replacement, solenoid replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (solenoid) - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild)

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension (if equipped) - Compressor Failure/Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: On models equipped with the Quadra-Lift air suspension system, issues with the air compressor are common. This can cause the vehicle to sag, not maintain proper ride height, or display error messages. Air leaks in the system can also contribute.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air compressor, identifying and repairing air leaks (often at the air struts).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension (if equipped) - Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks in the air strut will cause issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500 per strut.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM is a common source of electrical issues in this generation of Grand Cherokee. Symptoms can include fuel pump relay failure (resulting in no-start conditions), stalling, random electrical malfunctions (lights, wipers, etc.), and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
