The 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee marked a significant redesign for the model, offering improved on-road manners and a more luxurious interior compared to its predecessors. While praised for its styling, off-road capability (especially with the Quadra-Trac and Quadra-Drive II systems), and improved fuel economy, the 2011 Grand Cherokee also experienced its share of problems. Engine options included a 3.6L Pentastar V6 (290 hp, 260 lb-ft torque) and a 5.7L Hemi V8 (360 hp, 390 lb-ft torque). Both engines were paired with a W5A580 5-speed automatic transmission. Common complaints include electrical issues, suspension problems, and some engine-related concerns. Many owners also enjoyed the interior space, styling, and performance.

**Summary**

The 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee, while a significant improvement over previous generations, has some notable issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the TIPM and air suspension systems, which can lead to costly repairs. The 3.6L V6 engine is known for cylinder head issues and oil filter housing leaks. The 5.7L Hemi V8's MDS system can also cause problems. Transmission issues such as rough shifting and torque converter shudder are also prevalent. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, especially those related to the air suspension or electrical problems. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection.
