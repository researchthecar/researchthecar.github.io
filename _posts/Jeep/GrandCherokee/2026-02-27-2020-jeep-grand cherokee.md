### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee demonstrates a generally solid reliability, particularly with its gasoline V6 and V8 engine options and standard transmission. The primary areas of concern tend to be associated with the more complex systems, such as the EcoDiesel engine's emissions components (DPF, EGR) and the Quadra-Lift air suspension. Electrical issues, mainly related to the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted but not universally prevalent. For owners of gasoline models with standard suspension, reliability is typically high. Those opting for the EcoDiesel or air suspension should be aware of potential maintenance needs and associated costs for these advanced features. Overall, with proper maintenance, the Grand Cherokee should provide dependable service, but vigilance with the aforementioned systems is advised.
