### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee presents a mixed reliability profile. The Pentastar V6 and HEMI V8 engines are generally robust, though some owners report oil and coolant leaks, and potential issues with the MDS system on the V8. The EcoDiesel engine, while powerful, is more prone to DPF and EGR problems. Transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting and torque converter problems, are noted for the 8-speed automatic. The standard suspension is reliable, but the optional Quadra-Lift air suspension can be a source of costly repairs due to leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the Uconnect system and occasional battery drain, are also reported. Overall, the Grand Cherokee is a capable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific technical concerns, especially regarding the EcoDiesel and air suspension options.
