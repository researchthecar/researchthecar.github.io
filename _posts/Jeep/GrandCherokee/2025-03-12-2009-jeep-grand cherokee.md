The 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a mid-size SUV known for its off-road capability and available V8 power. Engine options for the 2009 model year included a 3.7L V6 (210 hp, 235 lb-ft of torque), a 4.7L V8 (305 hp, 334 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.7L Hemi V8 (357 hp, 389 lb-ft of torque). The 3.7L V6 came with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Grand Cherokee's ruggedness, towing capacity (especially with the V8), and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include its fuel economy, some reliability issues, and the aging design.

**Summary**

The 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee has some notable potential issues. The TIPM failure is a significant concern due to its wide-ranging effects and difficulty in resolving permanently. Engine issues like valve seat failure on the 4.7L and lifter failure on the 5.7L can be very expensive. Suspension and transmission issues are also common and can lead to costly repairs. The overall severity ranges from minor electrical glitches to major engine and transmission problems. Cost-wise, potential owners should be prepared for a range of repair bills from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, especially if major components need replacement. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended.
