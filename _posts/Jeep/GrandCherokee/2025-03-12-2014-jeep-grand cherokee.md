Engine problems, particularly cylinder head issues in the 3.6L V6 and potential turbocharger failures in the EcoDiesel, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the 8-speed automatic can range from minor software glitches to major component failures. Air suspension problems, while offering a comfortable ride, can also be expensive to fix. Electrical gremlins in the Uconnect system and other components are also frequently reported.
