### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee, while offering a compelling package for its segment, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of vehicles of its age and design. The 4.0L and 4.7L engines are prone to cylinder head issues and leaks, while transmissions can experience torque converter or solenoid problems. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods require regular inspection. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a significant issue in certain climates, and interior climate control problems are frequently reported. Despite these potential issues, many Grand Cherokees remain on the road, often requiring proactive maintenance and repairs to address these known weak points.
