**Summary**

The 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee, while offering a comfortable and capable driving experience, has its share of common issues. Engine problems, such as the "Hemi Tick" and exhaust manifold issues in V8 models, and cold start knocking noises in the V6, can be costly to repair. The 8-speed automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting, requiring software updates or valve body replacement. Electrical issues, particularly with the Uconnect system, are also prevalent. Air suspension failures, if equipped, can add to the maintenance burden. While some issues are minor annoyances, others can lead to significant repair bills, making it important for potential buyers to carefully inspect the vehicle and be aware of these potential problems.
