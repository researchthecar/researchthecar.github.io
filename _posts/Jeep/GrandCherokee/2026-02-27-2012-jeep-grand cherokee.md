### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a capable SUV with a generally good reliability record, especially for its off-road oriented nature. The Pentastar V6 engine has a few known leak points, and the older 5-speed automatic transmission can experience shifting issues and module failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the TIPM, are a notable concern. Owners with the optional air suspension should be aware of potential leaks. While the HEMI V8 and the newer 8-speed transmission appear more robust, proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of issues are recommended for a trouble-free ownership experience.
