### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee can be a capable and enjoyable SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the engines and transmissions. The diesel engine, while powerful, is prone to expensive turbocharger and injector problems. Gasoline V6 and V8 engines can suffer from cylinder head issues or specific component failures like the MDS system. Automatic transmissions, especially the 5-speed, are a frequent source of complaints regarding shifting and torque converter reliability. Suspension components and certain electrical modules also require attention. While not all Grand Cherokees will experience these problems, they represent the most commonly reported and costly repairs for this model year, suggesting a need for thorough pre-purchase inspection and diligent maintenance.
