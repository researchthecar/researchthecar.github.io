### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee, particularly with the 4.0L inline-six engine, is known for its durability, but it's not without its common issues. The 4.0L engine's cracked cylinder head and the 4.7L V8's potential SOHC conversion problems are significant concerns. Transmission reliability is generally good, though the 42RE can experience torque converter issues. Electrical gremlins, especially with the BCM and instrument cluster, are frequently reported. Exterior rust is a major concern in certain climates, and interior components like blend door actuators can fail. Despite these potential problems, many owners find the Grand Cherokee to be a capable and rewarding vehicle when properly maintained and repaired.
