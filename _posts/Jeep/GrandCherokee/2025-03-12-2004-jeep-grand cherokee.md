The 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a popular SUV known for its off-road capability and comfortable ride. Engine options include the 4.0L Inline-6 producing 195 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, the 4.7L V8 producing 235 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and the high-performance 5.7L Hemi V8 (introduced mid-year) producing 330 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are primarily the 4-speed automatic (42RE for the 4.0L, 45RFE and 545RFE for the V8s). Owners often praise its ruggedness and spacious interior, while common complaints revolve around fuel economy and some reliability issues, especially with age.

**Summary**

The 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a capable SUV, but owners should be aware of potential issues related to its age. Engine issues range from minor leaks to more significant problems like valve seat issues in the 5.7L Hemi. Transmission problems, especially with the solenoid packs and valve bodies, can be costly to repair. Suspension components are also prone to wear, requiring replacement. Electrical issues such as blend door actuator failure are common inconveniences. Rust can be a significant concern, particularly in areas with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly. Pre-purchase inspections and a thorough maintenance history are highly recommended.
