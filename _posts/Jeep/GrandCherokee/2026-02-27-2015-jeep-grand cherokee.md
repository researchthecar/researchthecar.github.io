### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee offers a compelling package, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of certain common issues. The Pentastar V6 and HEMI V8 engines can experience intake manifold and fuel injector problems, respectively. The EcoDiesel variant is more prone to DPF and EGR cooler issues, which can be costly to repair. Transmission concerns, particularly with the 8-speed automatic, often manifest as harsh shifting or torque converter problems. While suspension issues are less common, air suspension systems can develop leaks or sensor faults. Electrical gremlins, such as Uconnect system glitches and battery drain, are also reported. Exterior water leaks and interior seat heater malfunctions are less critical but still noteworthy. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, proactive maintenance and awareness of these specific components are recommended for optimal long-term ownership.
