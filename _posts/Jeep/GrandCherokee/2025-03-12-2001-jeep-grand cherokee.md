The 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a popular SUV known for its off-road capability and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 4.0L inline-6, a 4.7L V8, and a 2.7L diesel (primarily outside the US market). The 4.0L I6 produced around 195 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. The 4.7L V8 produced around 235 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Many owners appreciated the Grand Cherokee's ruggedness and spacious interior, but common complaints included electrical issues, transmission problems, and rust. The information below is based on common issues reported, acknowledging that not every vehicle will experience all of these problems.

**Engine**

**4.0L Inline-6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common around the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the location of the leak and the shop's labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating can be caused by a failing radiator, thermostat, water pump, or clogged cooling system. Symptoms include high temperature gauge readings, steam from the engine, and coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cooling system and replace the faulty component(s). Flushing the cooling system is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the specific issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.7L V8**

*   **"Sludge" build up**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil sludge can build up in the engine due to poor maintenance and/or the factory recommended oil change interval. This sludge can lead to premature wear of the engine's internal components such as the connecting rod bearings and the camshaft bearings.
    *   Solution: Shorten the oil change interval and use the correct oil type/specifications. Oil additives such as Sea Foam or Marvel Mystery Oil are helpful to keep the engine cleaner on the inside.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 for oil treatments and oil changes. However, if the damage is already done to the engine, the cost of replacing the engine is much more and can get up to $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.0L, oil leaks can occur from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the location of the leak and the shop's labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.0L, overheating can be caused by a failing radiator, thermostat, water pump, or clogged cooling system. Symptoms include high temperature gauge readings, steam from the engine, and coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cooling system and replace the faulty component(s). Flushing the cooling system is recommended.
