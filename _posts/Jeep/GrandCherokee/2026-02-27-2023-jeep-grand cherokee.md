### Summary Verdict
The 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its core powertrain components (3.6L V6, 5.7L V8, and the PHEV system) and standard transmission, which show no significant widespread issues. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the optional Quadra-Lift air suspension system, which can experience issues with the compressor or air springs, and occasional infotainment system software glitches. The 12V battery has also been noted as a component that may require earlier-than-expected replacement in some instances. For most owners, the Grand Cherokee should provide a dependable experience, but those opting for the air suspension should be aware of potential repair costs.
