### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee presents a generally reliable package, particularly with the V6 engine. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the intake manifold and oil cooler on the 3.6L Pentastar. The HEMI V8 can experience cylinder deactivation problems, and the EcoDiesel variant has known concerns with its DPF and EGR systems. Transmission issues, primarily related to harsh shifting and torque converter problems with the 8-speed automatic, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, especially with the Uconnect system and occasional battery drain, can occur. While suspension is generally robust, air suspension systems (if equipped) can be a source of leaks. Overall, the Grand Cherokee is a capable SUV, but vigilance regarding these specific components is advised for optimal long-term ownership.
