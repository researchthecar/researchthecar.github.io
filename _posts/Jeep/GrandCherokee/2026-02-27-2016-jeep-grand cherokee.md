### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee offers a compelling package, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The gasoline V6 engines are generally robust, though intake manifold and oil cooler leaks can occur. The HEMI V8 has potential issues related to its cylinder deactivation system. The EcoDiesel engine, while powerful and efficient, is more prone to issues with its Diesel Particulate Filter and EGR system, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with harsh shifting and torque converter problems, are also noted. The air suspension system, if equipped, can be a source of leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, such as Uconnect system glitches and battery drain, are also reported. Overall, the Grand Cherokee can be a reliable vehicle if these potential issues are addressed promptly and with proper maintenance.
