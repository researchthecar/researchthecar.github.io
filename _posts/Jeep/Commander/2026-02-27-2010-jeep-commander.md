### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Jeep Commander is a capable SUV, but its reliability can be a concern, particularly with the larger engine options and automatic transmission. Common issues include leaks from the engine's oil cooler and intake manifold on the 3.7L, and more severe head gasket problems on the 4.7L V8. Transmission problems like harsh shifting and torque converter failure are also noted. Electrical gremlins, especially with the BCM and power accessories, can add to repair bills. While the suspension is generally robust, wear items like ball joints can require attention. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs, especially if opting for higher mileage examples or those with the less reliable engine variants.
