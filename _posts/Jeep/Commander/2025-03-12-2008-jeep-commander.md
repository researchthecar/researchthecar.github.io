The 2008 Jeep Commander is a mid-size SUV offering a blend of off-road capability and family-friendly features. Available engine options included a 3.7L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, a 4.7L V8 making 305 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L HEMI V8 outputting 330 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque. The 3.7L V6 was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 4.7L and 5.7L V8s were equipped with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Commander's spacious interior, towing capacity, and classic Jeep styling. However, common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy, some reliability concerns, and a somewhat cumbersome driving experience due to its size and weight.
