The 2006 Jeep Commander was Jeep's attempt at a more family-oriented SUV with three rows of seating, while still maintaining the rugged Jeep image. Engine options for the 2006 Commander included a 3.7L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, a 4.7L V8 producing 235 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L HEMI V8 producing 330 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque. The 3.7L was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 engines came with a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Commander's off-road capability and spaciousness, but common complaints include fuel economy, reliability issues, and the overall cumbersome size of the vehicle.
