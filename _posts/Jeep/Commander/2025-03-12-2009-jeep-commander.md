The 2009 Jeep Commander is a mid-size SUV known for its rugged styling and off-road capabilities. It offers a blend of Jeep's traditional design with a more spacious three-row interior. Engine options include a 3.7L V6, a 4.7L V8, and a 5.7L HEMI V8. The 3.7L V6 produced around 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. The vehicle is generally appreciated for its towing capacity and off-road prowess, but criticized for its fuel economy and some reliability concerns. While it has a classic Jeep look, some find the interior materials and overall fit and finish to be subpar for its class.

**Summary**

The 2009 Jeep Commander, while appreciated for its style and capabilities, presents a range of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 4.7L V8's valve seats, can be costly to address. The electrical system, especially the TIPM, is another common source of trouble. Suspension and transmission issues can also arise. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing, factoring in potential repair costs. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive, making a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic highly recommended.
