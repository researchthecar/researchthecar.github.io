### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Jeep Commander, while offering a distinct style and capability, is not without its reliability concerns. The V8 engines, particularly the 4.7L, are more prone to significant issues like head gasket failures and camshaft problems compared to the 3.7L V6, which has its own set of intake and cooler leaks. Transmission issues, especially with the 5-speed automatic, can lead to costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or TIPM, are a notable weakness. Suspension components can develop noises, and interior elements like HVAC actuators and infotainment systems are also reported to fail. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in maintenance costs.
