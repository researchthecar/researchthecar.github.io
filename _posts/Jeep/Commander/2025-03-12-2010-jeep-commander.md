The 2010 Jeep Commander is a mid-size SUV known for its boxy, rugged styling and off-road capabilities, reminiscent of the classic Jeep Cherokee. It offered a blend of truck-like toughness and family-friendly features, though it was ultimately discontinued after the 2010 model year. The 2010 Commander came with a choice of three engines: a 3.7L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, a 4.7L V8 producing 305 horsepower and 334 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L HEMI V8 producing 357 horsepower and 389 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed automatic for the V6 and 4.7L V8, and a 5-speed automatic for the 5.7L HEMI. Owners often appreciated the Commander's spacious interior, towing capacity, and off-road prowess. However, common complaints included its subpar fuel economy, cumbersome handling, and overall reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common around the valve cover gaskets and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets and/or oil pan gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or unstable idle can be caused by vacuum leaks, a dirty throttle body, or a faulty idle air control valve.
    *   Solution: Inspect for vacuum leaks, clean the throttle body, or replace the idle air control valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.7L V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold bolts have been known to break over time due to heat cycling. This causes an exhaust leak, leading to a ticking noise, reduced performance, and potentially decreased fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 3.7L V6, oil leaks can occur around the valve cover gaskets and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets and/or oil pan gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **HEMI Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or clicking noise, often most apparent at idle and low RPMs. This is often attributed to a loose or damaged exhaust manifold bolt or a failing lifter.
    *   Solution: Replacing damaged lifters, or replacing the broken exhaust manifold bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ (depending on severity and if lifters need to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common around the rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear main seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (W5A580 / NAG1)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears. This can be more pronounced during upshifts or downshifts, or when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Fluid change, valve body repair/replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration, especially at highway speeds. This can be caused by torque converter clutch slippage.
    * Solution: Flush the transmission fluid and add a friction modifier. In severe cases, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Squeaking or Clunking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or clunking noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. This is often due to worn-out bushings, ball joints, or sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn-out suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, wandering, and clunking noises from the front end. Can be detected during a suspension inspection.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$600+ per ball joint
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic electrical behavior, including the vehicle not starting, stalling, headlights flickering, fuel pump issues, and other seemingly random electrical problems.
    *   Solution: Replace or repair the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: Some Chrysler vehicles with TIPMs were recalled, but it's essential to check if your specific VIN is affected.

**Summary**

The 2010 Jeep Commander presents a mixed bag for potential owners. While it offers rugged styling, decent off-road capability, and a spacious interior, it also suffers from a range of reliability issues. Engine oil leaks, exhaust manifold bolt failures, and the dreaded "HEMI tick" can lead to significant repair bills. Electrical problems stemming from the TIPM are also a concern. Suspension issues like worn bushings and ball joints are typical for a vehicle of this age. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like TIPM replacement or major engine work, can be costly. Prospective buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and factor in potential maintenance costs.
