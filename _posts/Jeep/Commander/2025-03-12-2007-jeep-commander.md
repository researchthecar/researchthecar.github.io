The 2007 Jeep Commander is a mid-size SUV that offers a blend of rugged off-road capability and family-friendly practicality. It was available with a variety of engine options: a 3.7L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, a 4.7L V8 producing 235 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L Hemi V8 producing 330 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with either a 5-speed automatic transmission (V8 models) or a 4-speed automatic (V6). Many owners appreciate the Commander's spacious interior, third-row seating, and Jeep's signature off-road prowess. However, common complaints include its poor fuel economy, somewhat cramped third-row, and a reputation for various mechanical and electrical issues.
