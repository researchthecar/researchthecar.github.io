### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Jeep Liberty offers a capable platform, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The gasoline engines, particularly the 2.4L, can suffer from head gasket problems and oil leaks. The 3.7L V6 is more prone to oil leaks and intake manifold issues. The diesel 2.8L CRD has its own set of concerns, including glow plug and turbocharger problems. Automatic transmission reliability is a concern, with overheating and solenoid failures being reported. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear prematurely. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and window regulators, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a significant issue in certain climates, and interior wear on seats is typical. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the Liberty's off-road prowess and utility outweigh these concerns, provided maintenance is kept up and known issues are addressed.
