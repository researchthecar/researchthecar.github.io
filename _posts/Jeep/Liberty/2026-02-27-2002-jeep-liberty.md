### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Jeep Liberty presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline engines, particularly the 3.7L V6, are prone to intake manifold leaks and oil cooler line issues. The 2.5L CRD diesel engine can suffer from glow plug and turbocharger problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the 42RLE, are known for harsh shifting and overheating, often requiring significant repairs. Suspension components like ball joints and shocks can wear out, and electrical issues with the BCM and window regulators are not uncommon. Rust can also be a concern on older models. While capable, potential buyers should be prepared for potential maintenance costs, especially concerning the powertrain and electrical systems.
