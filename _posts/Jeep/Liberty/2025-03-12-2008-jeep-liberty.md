The 2008 Jeep Liberty is a compact SUV that offers a blend of off-road capability and everyday practicality. It came standard with a 3.7L V6 engine producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. The 3.7L engine was paired with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the Liberty's rugged styling and available four-wheel-drive system, making it capable in various driving conditions.
