The 2003 Jeep Liberty marked a new direction for Jeep, offering a more compact and fuel-efficient SUV compared to the larger Grand Cherokee. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a more popular 3.7L V6 generating 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual (mainly with the 2.4L) and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Liberty's off-road capability (especially with the 4x4 models), its distinctive Jeep styling, and its comfortable ride. Common complaints centered around fuel economy, some reliability issues, and the somewhat cramped rear seating.
