The 2012 Jeep Liberty is a compact SUV offered with a single engine and transmission combination: a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. While appreciated for its off-road capabilities and truck-like styling, the Liberty is often criticized for its fuel economy, outdated transmission, and cramped interior compared to other SUVs in its class. Owners tend to like the ruggedness of the vehicle while disliking the lack of modern features.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a fairly common issue, often originating from the valve cover gaskets or oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the vehicle, the smell of burning oil, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **P0300 Random Misfire**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may experience a rough idle, loss of power, and the check engine light illuminates with code P0300 (random/multiple cylinder misfire detected). This can be caused by worn spark plugs, faulty ignition coils, or vacuum leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the spark plugs and ignition coils, or repairing any vacuum leaks, is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or harsh shifting between gears, particularly noticeable when accelerating or decelerating.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement might alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body issues or internal damage might require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for fluid/filter, $500 - $3000+ for rebuild/replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs high without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, indicating the transmission is slipping.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid level check. If the fluid is low or burnt, a fluid and filter change might help. If slipping continues, internal damage is likely, requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for fluid/filter, $500 - $3000+ for rebuild/replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joints and Control Arms**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of front suspension components, leading to clunking noises, uneven tire wear, and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints, control arms, and potentially the struts can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side, depending on parts replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power windows. This can be due to faulty window switches, wiring problems, or a failing window motor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty switch or window motor. Repairing any damaged wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls various electrical functions, and failures can lead to a wide range of issues, including stalling, fuel pump failure, erratic wiper operation, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM is often the only solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: Some Jeeps were recalled for TIPM issues, but not specifically the 2012 Liberty. Check your VIN.

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Window Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear window wiper stops working. The motor either fails completely, or seizes up.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear wiper motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noises from behind the dashboard and inconsistent temperature control (e.g., only hot air blows on one side). This indicates a faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Jeep Liberty has some common issues owners report. Engine oil leaks and electrical problems such as the TIPM issues appear most serious and costly. Suspension wear can also lead to safety concerns and repair bills. While not every 2012 Jeep Liberty will experience all of these problems, a prospective buyer should be aware of them and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing. The age of the vehicle (over a decade old) contributes to increased likelihood of these issues arising.
