**Introduction to the 2012 Jeep Liberty**

The 2012 Jeep Liberty is a compact SUV offered with two engine options: a 3.7L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L V6 diesel producing 177 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Despite its rugged appearance, the Liberty offers a surprisingly comfortable ride and plenty of space for passengers and cargo. However, it has been met with criticism for its unrefined engine options, lack of advanced driver-assistance systems, and subpar fuel economy.
