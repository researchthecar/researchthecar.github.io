The 2006 Jeep Liberty is a compact SUV known for its off-road capability and rugged styling. It was available with two engine options: a 2.8L CRD (Common Rail Diesel) inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.7L PowerTech V6 producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic and a 6-speed manual (paired only with the diesel engine). Owners often appreciate the Liberty's comfortable ride and Jeep's legacy of off-road capability. However, common complaints include poor fuel economy, some reliability issues, and a somewhat dated interior.
