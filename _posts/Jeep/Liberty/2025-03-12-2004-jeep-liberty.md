The 2004 Jeep Liberty is a compact SUV known for its off-road capability and Jeep styling. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a more popular 3.7L V6 making 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual, available only with the 2.4L I4, and a 4-speed automatic (42RLE) available with both engines. Owners often praise the Liberty's ruggedness and 4x4 performance, but common complaints include fuel economy, ride quality, and some reliability issues.
