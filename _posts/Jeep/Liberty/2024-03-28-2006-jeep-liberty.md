**Introduction**

The 2006 Jeep Liberty is a compact SUV known for its off-road capabilities and rugged design. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 engine and a 3.7L V6 engine. The 2.4L engine produced 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.7L engine produced 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic transmission for the 2.4L engine and a 4-speed or 6-speed manual transmission for the 3.7L engine. The Liberty received praise for its robust exterior, spacious interior, and off-road prowess. However, it was also criticized for its unrefined engine, sluggish acceleration, and dated infotainment system.
