The 2002 Jeep Liberty marked a new direction for Jeep, offering a smaller, more fuel-efficient SUV compared to the larger Cherokee. Two engine options were available: a 2.4L inline-four producing 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a more popular 3.7L V6 generating 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual (paired with the 2.4L) and a 4-speed automatic (optional with the 2.4L, standard with the 3.7L). Owners often praised the Liberty's off-road capability, compact size, and distinctive Jeep styling. Common criticisms included a somewhat rough ride, lower fuel economy than expected for its size, and some reliability concerns.
