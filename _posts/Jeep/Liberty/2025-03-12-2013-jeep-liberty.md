The 2013 Jeep Liberty, a compact SUV, offered a blend of off-road capability and everyday usability. The sole engine option was a 3.7-liter V6 producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised its rugged styling and off-road prowess. However, some criticisms included a somewhat outdated interior, subpar fuel economy, and handling that wasn't as refined as some of its competitors.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**

    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets is the usual fix. The engine area will be cleaned up after.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

*   **Rough Idling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.7L engine has been known to have rough idle, engine misfires, and even stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn out spark plugs, ignition coils, or cleaning the throttle body can help with idling issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hard or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush can sometimes resolve minor issues. More serious problems may require valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Control Arms**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of ball joints and control arm bushings can lead to clunking noises from the front end, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls various electrical functions. Problems can manifest as fuel pump relay failure (leading to stalling or no-start conditions), horn malfunctions, and issues with power windows or door locks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the TIPM is the common fix, but sometimes only the fuel pump relay needs to be repaired, or bypassed altogether.
