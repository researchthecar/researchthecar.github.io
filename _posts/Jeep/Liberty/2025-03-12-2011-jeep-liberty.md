The 2011 Jeep Liberty is a compact SUV known for its boxy styling and off-road capabilities, harking back to the classic Jeep design. It came standard with a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual. What people appreciate about the Liberty is its ruggedness, decent off-road performance, and comfortable ride on the road. Common complaints include unimpressive fuel economy, outdated interior styling, and a less-than-refined powertrain.
