### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Jeep Liberty, particularly with the 3.7L V6 engine, can be prone to oil leaks from valve covers and intake manifold issues. The 2.8L CRD diesel variant has known concerns with cylinder heads and glow plugs, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and shocks may require attention as the vehicle ages. Electrical gremlins, such as failing wiper motors and power window regulators, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be aware of these specific mechanical and electrical vulnerabilities, especially when considering higher-mileage examples or the diesel engine option.
