### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Jeep TJ Wrangler is a robust and capable off-road vehicle with a generally good reliability record for its age. The iconic 4.0L inline-six engine is known for its durability, though it can be prone to cracked cylinder heads and oil leaks. The 2.4L engine is less powerful but generally reliable, with common issues like oil leaks and cooling system problems. Manual transmissions, particularly the NV3550, are quite durable, while the automatic 42RLE can experience solenoid issues. Suspension components like bushings and leaf springs are common wear items, especially with off-road use. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to wiring harness corrosion and instrument cluster failures, can occur. Rust is a significant concern for TJs, especially in rust-belt regions. Overall, the TJ is a solid choice for enthusiasts, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
