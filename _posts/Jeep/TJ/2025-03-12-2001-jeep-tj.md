The 2001 Jeep TJ is a rugged and iconic off-road vehicle, known for its simplicity, solid front axle, and removable top and doors. It's a popular choice for enthusiasts who enjoy open-air driving and tackling challenging terrain. The 2001 TJ offered three engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing around 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, a 4.0L inline-6 generating approximately 190 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 147 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque (later models in the year). Transmission options included a 3-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual. Some of the common complaints with this vehicle are the lack of modern safety features, subpar fuel economy, and susceptibility to rust.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2001 Jeep TJ, while beloved for its off-road capabilities, does have several common issues. Rust, particularly on the frame, is a significant concern. Engine and transmission issues vary depending on the specific engine and transmission configuration, with the 4.0L I6 being susceptible to oil leaks and crankshaft sensor failures, and the manual transmission prone to synchronizer wear. Electrical problems, such as clock spring failure and grounding issues, can also occur. The severity and cost of these issues can range from minor repairs to significant expenses like frame or transmission replacement. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for rust and address any mechanical or electrical issues promptly.
