### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Jeep TJ is a capable and generally durable vehicle, especially for its intended off-road use. The most common significant issues tend to be related to the engine's cylinder head (particularly on the 4.0L) and oil filter adapter leaks, which are well-documented. Transmission issues, while present, are often specific to certain models and can be costly to repair.
