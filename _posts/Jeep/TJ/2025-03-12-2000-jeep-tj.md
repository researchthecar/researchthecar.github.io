The 2000 Jeep TJ is a popular off-road vehicle known for its ruggedness, simplicity, and open-air driving experience. It comes with several engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing approximately 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 4.0L inline-6 generating around 190 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 3-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual. Owners often praise the TJ for its off-road capabilities, easy customization, and classic Jeep styling. Common complaints include a somewhat rough ride, limited cargo space, and potential for rust.

**Overall Summary:**

The 2000 Jeep TJ is a capable and enjoyable vehicle, but like any older car, it is prone to certain issues. Rust, particularly on the windshield frame, is a common concern. Engine issues, such as exhaust manifold cracks on the 4.0L and oil leaks, can arise. Transmission problems, especially in the automatic, might require a rebuild or replacement. Suspension wear leading to "death wobble" requires careful attention. Electrical glitches due to corroded grounds or clock spring failures can also occur. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission work or addressing rust issues, can be costly. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle for these common problems and factor in potential repair costs.
