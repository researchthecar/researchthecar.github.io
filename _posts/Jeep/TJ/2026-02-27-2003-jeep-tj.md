### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Jeep TJ Wrangler is a robust vehicle with a strong reputation for off-road capability and durability. While the iconic 4.0L inline-six engine is generally reliable, it can be prone to head gasket issues or cracked heads with age and mileage. The manual transmissions, particularly the AX-5, can experience bearing wear. Automatic transmissions may develop torque converter or solenoid problems. Suspension components like leaf springs and bushings are common wear items, especially for off-road use. Electrical gremlins, such as worn wiring harnesses and faulty ignition switches, are not uncommon in vehicles of this vintage. Rust is a significant concern, particularly on the frame and body mounts, requiring diligent inspection and potential repair. Overall, the TJ is a solid platform, but owners should be aware of these potential issues and budget for maintenance and repairs accordingly.
