**Introduction to the 2002 Jeep TJ**

The 2002 Jeep TJ is a compact SUV known for its rugged appearance and off-road capabilities. The TJ was available with various engine and transmission options, including:

* 2.4-liter inline-four engine, 150 horsepower, 175 lb-ft of torque, mated to either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.
* 4.0-liter inline-six engine, 190 horsepower, 235 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

The TJ was praised for its durability, off-road prowess, and customization options. However, it also had its fair share of issues.

**Engine**

**2.4-liter Inline-Four Engine**

* **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption due to worn piston rings or valve seals. Symptoms include low oil levels on the dipstick and blue smoke from the exhaust. Solution involves replacing the piston rings or valve seals. Estimated Cost: $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure:** Failure of the camshaft position sensor leads to engine stalling or misfires. Symptoms include rough idling, engine hesitation, and illuminated check engine light. Solution is to replace the camshaft position sensor. Estimated Cost: $100 - $200+.

**4.0-liter Inline-Six Engine**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** Leaking intake manifold gasket causes coolant and oil to leak, resulting in overheating and engine damage. Symptoms include coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and rough idling. Solution involves replacing the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost: $500 - $800+.
* **Cylinder Head Cracking:** In severe cases, the cylinder head can crack due to overheating or manufacturing defects. Symptoms include coolant leaks, white smoke from the exhaust, and loss of power. Solution involves replacing the cylinder head. Estimated Cost: $2,000 - $3,000+.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Grinding Gears:** Difficult or impossible to shift into gear due to worn synchronizers or shift forks. Symptoms include grinding noises during shifting and difficulty selecting gears. Solution involves replacing the affected parts. Estimated Cost: $500 - $1,000+.

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Slipping Gears:** Inability to engage gears properly due to worn clutch plates or a faulty torque converter. Symptoms include delayed gear engagement, slipping gears while driving, and illuminated check engine light. Solution involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Estimated Cost: $2,000 - $3,000+.

**Suspension**

* **Worn Control Arms:** Deteriorated control arms lead to poor handling and reduced stability. Symptoms include excessive vibrations, tire wear, and a clunking noise over bumps. Solution involves replacing the control arms. Estimated Cost: $400 - $600+.
* **Failed Shock Absorbers:** Ineffective shock absorbers result in poor ride quality and reduced off-road capabilities. Symptoms include excessive bouncing, swaying, and difficulty handling road conditions. Solution is to replace the shock absorbers. Estimated Cost: $200 - $400+.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** Malfunctioning alternator fails to charge the battery, causing electrical failures and stalling. Symptoms include dim headlights, difficulty starting, and illuminated battery light. Solution involves replacing the alternator. Estimated Cost: $300 - $500+.
* **Electrical Harness Shorts:** Short circuits in the electrical harness can cause various electrical issues, including blown fuses, power windows malfunctioning, and dashboard lights flickering. Solution involves identifying and repairing the shorted wires. Estimated Cost: Varies depending on the extent of the damage.

**Exterior**

* **Rust-prone Rocker Panels:** The rocker panels are susceptible to rust, leading to structural damage and unsightly appearance. Symptoms include surface rust spots or perforation through the metal. Solution involves repairing or replacing the affected panels. Estimated Cost: Varies depending on the extent of damage.

**Interior**

* **Faulty Window Regulators:** Inoperable window regulators prevent windows from opening or closing properly. Symptoms include windows stuck in place, slow or jerky movement, and grinding noises. Solution involves replacing the window regulators. Estimated Cost: $200 - $400+.
* **Broken HVAC Control Panel:** Malfunctioning control panel hinders climate control functions. Symptoms include inability to adjust temperature or fan speed, flickering display, and no response from buttons. Solution is to replace the HVAC control panel. Estimated Cost: $100 - $200+.

**Summary**

The 2002 Jeep TJ is a capable off-road vehicle, but it is not without its issues. Engine problems, transmission failures, suspension wear, and electrical glitches are among the most common concerns reported by owners. The severity of these issues can vary, but repairs can be costly, especially for major engine or transmission issues. However, the TJ's ruggedness and customization options make it a popular choice for enthusiasts who are willing to address potential maintenance issues.
