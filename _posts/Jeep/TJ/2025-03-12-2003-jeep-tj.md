**Summary**
The 2003 Jeep TJ, while generally reliable, has some common issues owners should be aware of. Engine oil leaks and crankshaft position sensor failure are prevalent with the 4.0L inline-6, while cracked exhaust manifolds are common with the 2.4L inline-4. Suspension issues, particularly the "death wobble", can be dangerous and require prompt attention. Electrical gremlins, especially grounding issues, can be frustrating to diagnose. Rust, particularly on the frame, is a significant concern in regions with harsh winters. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely, but addressing these issues promptly can prevent further damage and ensure the long-term reliability of the vehicle.
