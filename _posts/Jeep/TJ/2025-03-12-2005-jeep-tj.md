Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2005 Jeep TJ, formatted for your website.

The 2005 Jeep TJ represents the last year of this iconic generation, known for its simplicity, off-road prowess, and removable doors and top.  It's available with two primary engine choices: a 2.4L inline-4 producing around 147 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a more desirable 4.0L inline-6 generating approximately 190 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners love the TJ for its trail capability and customization potential, but often dislike the relatively poor fuel economy, limited cargo space, and sometimes rough ride on pavement.
