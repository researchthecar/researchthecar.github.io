### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Jeep TJ is a capable and generally reliable vehicle, particularly the 4.0L inline-six engine, which is known for its longevity. However, potential buyers and owners should be aware of common issues such as oil and coolant leaks, especially with the 2.4L engine, and the possibility of head gasket or cracked head issues on the 4.0L. Manual transmissions, particularly the AX-5, can be prone to input shaft bearing failure. Automatic transmissions may develop shifting problems. Suspension components like bushings and leaf springs are common wear items, and frame rust can be a significant concern in certain climates. Electrical gremlins, such as wiring shorts and instrument cluster issues, can also arise. Despite these potential drawbacks, with proper maintenance and addressing known issues, the 2004 Jeep TJ remains a desirable and durable off-road platform.
