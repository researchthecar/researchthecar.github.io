The 2004 Jeep TJ is a classic, renowned for its off-road capability and simple, rugged design. It came with a choice of three engines: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 147 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, a 4.0L inline-6 producing 190 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 147 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the TJ's off-road prowess, removable doors and top, and overall fun factor. Common complaints revolve around its relatively poor fuel economy, basic interior, and sometimes rough ride.

**Summary**

The 2004 Jeep TJ is a capable and desirable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Rust is a major concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. Engine oil leaks, overheating in the 4.0L, and "death wobble" are also prevalent issues to look out for. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can be expensive to repair. Addressing these issues can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing a sensor or gasket to more substantial repairs like a transmission rebuild or frame repair. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
