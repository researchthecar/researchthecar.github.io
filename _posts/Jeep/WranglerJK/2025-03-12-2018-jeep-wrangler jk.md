The 2018 Jeep Wrangler JK is the last of its generation, offering a blend of classic Wrangler styling and off-road capability. It came standard with a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine producing 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its iconic design, removable top and doors, and impressive off-road prowess. However, some common complaints include wind noise at highway speeds, a somewhat unrefined ride, and fuel economy that is below-average for the class.
