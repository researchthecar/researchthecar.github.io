The 2016 Jeep Patriot is a compact SUV known for its affordability and off-road capabilities, reminiscent of classic Jeep styling. It offered two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter inline-4 generating 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic (available with the 2.4L engine), and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Patriot's low price point and Jeep heritage, while common complaints revolve around its lackluster fuel economy, unrefined driving experience, and dated interior.
