**Introduction to the 2016 Jeep Patriot**

The 2016 Jeep Patriot is a compact SUV known for its rugged design and off-road capabilities. It comes equipped with a standard 2.4L Tigershark I-4 engine that produces 180 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Patriot is also available with a 2.0L Tigershark I-4 engine that generates 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, coupled to a 5-speed manual transmission or a CVT.

Despite its off-road prowess and rugged appearance, the 2016 Jeep Patriot has received criticism for its subpar fuel economy, lack of refinement, and questionable reliability.
