Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2012 Jeep Patriot, categorized for clarity and accuracy.

The 2012 Jeep Patriot is a compact SUV known for its affordability and off-road capability in some configurations. It offered a blend of Jeep styling and fuel efficiency. It was generally liked for its price point and available 4x4 system, but often criticized for its somewhat underpowered engines and less refined interior. The 2012 Jeep Patriot offered two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic (only with the 2.4L engine), and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), which was often the source of complaints.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls intermittently, especially at idle or when coming to a stop. May occur more frequently in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Check and clean the throttle body, inspect the mass airflow sensor, and update the PCM software if available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs. This can lead to engine damage if not addressed. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Conduct an oil consumption test to confirm the issue. If confirmed, potential solutions include replacing the piston rings or, in severe cases, the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, resulting in rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic codes may indicate misfires on specific cylinders.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the misfire, which could include faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors. Replace the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips or hesitates during acceleration, especially when cold. The vehicle may struggle to maintain speed on inclines.
    *   Solution: Perform a CVT fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, the CVT may require more extensive repairs or replacement. Some owners have reported success with valve body replacements.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+

*   **Jerky Shifting/Rough Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifting between drive and reverse or during acceleration. The CVT may feel unpredictable or unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the CVT fluid level and condition. If the fluid is contaminated, perform a flush and replace the filter. If the problem continues, a more in-depth inspection of the CVT may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**
*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or abrupt gear changes, especially when upshifting or downshifting.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Coil Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear coil springs can break or sag prematurely, causing the vehicle to sit lower in the rear and potentially affecting handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear coil springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs for improved durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
