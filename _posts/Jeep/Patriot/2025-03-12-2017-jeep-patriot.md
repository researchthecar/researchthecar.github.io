The 2017 Jeep Patriot is a compact SUV known for its affordability and off-road capabilities (particularly the Freedom Drive II models). Engine options include a 2.0L inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine was available with a 5-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 2.4L offered the same 5-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic transmission, or the CVT. Many owners appreciate its simple design and value, while some dislike its dated interior, fuel economy, and overall performance.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating and engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and addressing any leaks. If consumption is severe, a compression test and leak-down test may be needed to determine the source. Replacement of piston rings or engine rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of the engine stalling at low speeds or when coming to a stop.
    *   Solution: Investigation into potential causes such as a faulty idle air control valve, mass airflow sensor, or throttle body. Cleaning or replacement of the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine experiences misfires, leading to rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and a check engine light. Often related to ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cylinder experiencing the misfire. Replace the faulty ignition coil and spark plug.
