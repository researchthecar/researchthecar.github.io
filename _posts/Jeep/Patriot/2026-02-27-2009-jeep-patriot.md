### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Jeep Patriot presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.4L engine is prone to oil leaks and VVT issues, while the CVT transmission is a significant concern due to overheating and potential failure. Suspension components like struts and control arm bushings can wear out, leading to ride quality and handling problems. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are also reported. Exterior rust can be an issue depending on climate, and interior components like HVAC blend doors and seat upholstery may require attention. The manual and 4-speed automatic transmissions appear more robust than the CVT. Prospective buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor potential repair costs into their ownership considerations.
