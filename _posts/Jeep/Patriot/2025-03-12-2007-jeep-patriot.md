The 2007 Jeep Patriot was Jeep's entry into the compact SUV market. It offered Jeep styling and available four-wheel drive at a lower price point. Two engine options were available: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (available with both engines), a continuously variable transmission (CVT) for both engines (labeled CVT2 with the 2.4L for 4x4 models), and a 6-speed automatic transmission with the 2.4L engine. Owners generally appreciate the Patriot's affordability and off-road capability (especially with the Freedom Drive II package), but criticize its lackluster fuel economy, subpar interior quality, and some reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls unexpectedly, particularly at idle or low speeds. May occur intermittently.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body, replacing the idle air control valve (if equipped), or checking for vacuum leaks can often resolve the issue. Sometimes a PCM reflash is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes related to oxygen sensor malfunction. Reduced fuel economy and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various engine seals and gaskets, such as the valve cover gasket or oil pan gasket. Visible oil drips and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking seals and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Actuator/Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, and a check engine light related to the camshaft position actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft actuator or solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT2 (2.4L 4x4 models)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips or hesitates during acceleration, especially at higher speeds. May be accompanied by unusual noises.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change using the correct CVT fluid is often recommended as a first step. In more severe cases, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT overheats, especially during extended periods of driving at high speeds or in hot weather. This can trigger a warning light and put the transmission in "limp mode".
    *   Solution: Installing an auxiliary transmission cooler may help prevent overheating. Fluid changes and avoiding prolonged high-speed driving are also recommended. In severe cases, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (cooler installation) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual (2.0L and 2.4L models)**
*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, slipping clutch, or complete failure of the clutch.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Springs Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sags, especially when loaded. Broken or cracked rear springs. Poor ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as stalling, non-starting, malfunctioning fuel pump, or problems with the lights and wipers.
    *   Solution: Replacing the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Jeep Patriot, while affordable and capable, suffers from several common issues. The most significant problems involve the CVT transmission, TIPM module, and suspension components. Engine issues such as oil leaks and stalling are also prevalent. The severity and cost of these repairs vary, with CVT replacements being the most expensive. Addressing these potential issues is crucial for maintaining the longevity and reliability of the vehicle.
