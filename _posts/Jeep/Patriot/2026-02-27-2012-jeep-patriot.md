### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Jeep Patriot presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.4L engine is more prone to oil leaks and VVT issues than the 2.0L. The CVT transmission is a significant concern, with reports of overheating, failure, and hesitation, often leading to costly repairs. While the 6-speed automatic is generally more robust, the CVT should be approached with caution. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the Body Control Module and power windows, are also noted. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates, and interior components like blend door actuators and seat fabric may require attention. Overall, while the Patriot can be an affordable vehicle, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential maintenance costs, especially concerning the transmission.
