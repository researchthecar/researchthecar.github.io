## 2015 Jeep Patriot

The 2015 Jeep Patriot is a compact SUV that offers a blend of off-road capability and everyday practicality. It is available with a choice of two engines: a 160-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder and a 172-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder. Both engines are paired with a standard six-speed manual transmission, while a continuously variable transmission (CVT) is optional.

Despite its rugged appearance, the Patriot has received mixed reviews from consumers. Some praise its off-road abilities and spacious interior, while others criticize its sluggish performance and poor fuel economy.
