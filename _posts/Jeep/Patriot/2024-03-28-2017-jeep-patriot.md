**Introduction**

The 2017 Jeep Patriot is a compact SUV available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-four or a 2.4-liter inline-four. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The 2.0-liter engine produces 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque while the 2.4-liter engine produces 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. The Patriot is praised for its off-road capabilities and rugged exterior styling, but criticized for its cramped interior and lack of power from the base engine.
