### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Jeep Patriot is a functional vehicle that can be a good value, but it is not without its potential issues. Common problems tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly the CVT transmission's tendency for hesitation and overheating, and engine oil/coolant leaks. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM issues, and suspension wear are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. While many of these issues are repairable, they can add to the overall cost of ownership. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the reliability of a 2015 Patriot.
