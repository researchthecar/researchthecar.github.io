### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Jeep Patriot presents a mixed reliability picture. The gasoline engines are generally more dependable, though oil leaks and VVT issues can arise. The diesel engine, while offering better fuel economy, is more prone to significant and costly problems like head gasket failure and turbo issues. The CVT transmission is a notable weak point, with a higher incidence of failure and expensive repairs. Suspension components like strut mounts and control arm bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical problems, such as window regulators and ABS sensors, are also reported. Buyers should be particularly cautious of the CVT transmission and diesel engine variants, and factor in potential repair costs for these components.
