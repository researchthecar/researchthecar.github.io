The 2009 Jeep Patriot is a compact SUV known for its affordability and off-road capabilities, particularly in the 4x4 configurations. The base engine is a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque. An optional, more powerful engine is a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine that produces 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. The Patriot came with several transmission options depending on the engine and trim level, including a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic, and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Patriot's fuel economy (particularly with the 2.0L and manual transmission) and its Jeep styling. However, common complaints include lackluster performance, especially with the CVT, and a generally lower build quality compared to other vehicles in its class.

**Summary**

The 2009 Jeep Patriot has several potential issues buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the CVT transmission, which is prone to overheating and erratic behavior. The TIPM electrical module can also cause a wide range of problems. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rod ends may wear prematurely. Rust is also a potential concern, especially in colder climates. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, but addressing them could range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
