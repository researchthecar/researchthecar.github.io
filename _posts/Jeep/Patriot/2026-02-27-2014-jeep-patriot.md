### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Jeep Patriot presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanical components like the 6-speed automatic transmission and the 2.4L engine are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues with the CVT transmission, particularly concerning hesitation and overheating. Engine oil and cooling system leaks are also noted concerns for both engine options. Electrical gremlins, such as power window motor failures and battery drain, can be frustrating. Exterior rust is a common concern for vehicles of this age and type, especially in harsher climates. Interior issues like HVAC blower motor failure are also reported. Despite these potential drawbacks, many issues are repairable, and the Patriot can remain a functional vehicle with diligent maintenance and timely repairs.
