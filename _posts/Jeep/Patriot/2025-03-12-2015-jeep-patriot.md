The 2015 Jeep Patriot is a compact SUV known for its affordability and off-road capability, particularly in the 4x4 configurations. It offered a utilitarian approach to the SUV market, appealing to those seeking a budget-friendly vehicle with Jeep's signature styling. The 2015 Patriot came with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT), the latter being the most common on 4x4 models with the 2.4L engine. People generally liked the Patriot's low price point, its Jeep styling, and its available four-wheel-drive system. Common dislikes included its dated interior, lackluster fuel economy, and the CVT's performance.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls unexpectedly, particularly at low speeds or when idling. Can be intermittent and may not trigger any warning lights initially.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body, inspecting and replacing faulty sensors (such as the crankshaft position sensor or camshaft position sensor), or addressing vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an unusually high amount of oil between oil changes, often requiring frequent top-ups. This can be due to worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: A compression test can help determine the source of the oil consumption. If rings are the issue, an engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary. Replacing valve stem seals is a less intensive, but still costly, option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**
* No Issues Found

**6-Speed Automatic**
* No Issues Found

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Slipping/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT experiences slipping, hesitation, or a lack of power, especially when accelerating or climbing hills. The vehicle may also exhibit jerky movements.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid replacement is recommended at regular intervals. Diagnosis may require a transmission specialist to identify internal wear or damage to the belt or pulleys. If damage is severe, the entire CVT may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $4000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT overheats, often indicated by a warning light or message on the dashboard. This can lead to reduced performance and potential damage to the transmission.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace the CVT fluid cooler if it's clogged or damaged. Ensure the CVT fluid level is correct and that the fluid is in good condition. Consider adding an aftermarket transmission cooler for improved cooling capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Lower Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Uneven tire wear can also be a sign.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn lower control arm bushings. In some cases, it may be more cost-effective to replace the entire lower control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A wide range of electrical problems, including fuel pump relay failure (leading to stalling), intermittent starting issues, power window malfunctions, and erratic wiper operation.
    *   Solution: Replacing the TIPM. This is a common and often expensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Windshield Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windshield wipers stop working or operate erratically.
    *   Solution: Replace the windshield wiper motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Liftgate/Hatch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust develops around the license plate area, seams, and lower portion of the rear liftgate/hatch.
    *   Solution: Repairing and repainting the affected areas. In severe cases, replacing the entire liftgate/hatch may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric begins to detach from the backing and sag down, particularly in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Re-gluing the headliner fabric or replacing the entire headliner assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Jeep Patriot, while affordable, is known to have several common issues. The CVT transmission, particularly in models equipped with the 2.4L engine and 4x4, is a significant source of concern, with potential for slipping, overheating, and premature failure. Electrical problems related to the TIPM can also be costly to resolve. While some repairs, like replacing control arm bushings, are relatively inexpensive, others, like replacing the CVT or TIPM, can be major expenses. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. A thorough inspection, including a diagnostic scan and test drive, is highly recommended before buying a used 2015 Jeep Patriot.
