The 2008 Jeep Patriot is a compact SUV known for its affordability and Jeep's signature rugged styling. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual (available with both engines), a 4-speed automatic (primarily with the 2.0L), and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) (primarily with the 2.4L). People often appreciate the Patriot's low price point and off-road capability (especially in the 4x4 models), but common complaints revolve around its unimpressive fuel economy, lackluster interior quality, and reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2008 Jeep Patriot, while appealing for its price and Jeep heritage, suffers from several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The CVT transmission is a significant concern, with a high likelihood of failure and substantial repair costs. Electrical problems related to the TIPM are also prevalent and can manifest in various frustrating ways. Suspension issues, such as rear spring sag and control arm bushing wear, contribute to ride quality and handling problems. Rust is a common concern in regions with harsh winters. Overall, the 2008 Jeep Patriot has a relatively high risk of mechanical and electrical issues, potentially leading to significant repair bills. The most severe and costly issues are related to the CVT transmission, the TIPM, and potential engine repairs from the 2.4L oil consumption.
