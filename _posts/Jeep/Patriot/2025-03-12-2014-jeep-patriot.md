The 2014 Jeep Patriot is a compact SUV known for its affordability and off-road capability, particularly in the 4x4 configurations. Engine options for the 2014 Patriot include a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque.
