# 2017 Jeep Patriot

### Overview
The 2017 Jeep Patriot, a compact SUV known for its affordability and off-road capability, presents a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. While it offers a rugged exterior and a functional interior, potential owners should be aware of common issues that can arise. The powertrain, particularly the continuously variable transmission (CVT), is a frequent source of concern, often leading to premature failure. Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are also noted, though often within expected ranges for a vehicle of its age and price point. Engine options, while generally adequate, can also experience specific problems. Careful inspection and maintenance are crucial for mitigating these potential reliability concerns.

### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Jeep Patriot is a budget-friendly option, but its reliability can be a concern, particularly with the CVT transmission. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to the powertrain, electrical system, and suspension. While the 2.0L and 2.4L engines are generally robust, oil and cooling system leaks can occur. The CVT is the most significant weak point, often requiring costly repairs or replacement. Exterior rust can also be an issue depending on climate. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and awareness of common problems, the Patriot can still serve as a functional vehicle, especially for those prioritizing cost over long-term dependability.
