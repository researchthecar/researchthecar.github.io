### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Jeep Cherokee's primary reliability concern revolves around its innovative but problematic 9-speed automatic transmission, which can lead to costly repairs and a frustrating driving experience. Engine issues, while less common, do exist, particularly concerning oil and coolant leaks. Electrical gremlins, especially with the Uconnect system and potential battery drain, are also points to consider. Suspension, exterior, and interior components generally hold up well, with no major widespread complaints. Prospective buyers should prioritize vehicles with a documented history of transmission service or consider models with the less problematic 6-speed automatic if available, and be prepared for potential repair costs related to the transmission and engine.
