The 2022 Jeep Cherokee is a compact SUV known for its off-road capability and comfortable interior. Engine options include a 2.0L Turbo I4 producing 270 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L Pentastar V6 delivering 271 horsepower and 239 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. The Cherokee is liked for its user-friendly infotainment system and available four-wheel-drive systems. Some common dislikes include its somewhat cramped rear seats and occasionally hesitant transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbo I4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. The severity can vary, with some reporting needing to add a quart every 1,000-2,000 miles.
    * Solution: Dealerships often perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of loss. If deemed excessive, potential fixes can include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or in some severe cases, the entire engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $6,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing turbocharger failure leading to reduced engine power, unusual noises (whining, hissing), and potentially engine misfires.
    * Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the turbocharger for leaks, damage, or wear. Replacement of the turbocharger is typically the solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.2L Pentastar V6**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported engine misfires, often accompanied by a check engine light. This can result in rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and reduced power.
    * Solution: Diagnosis includes checking spark plugs, ignition coils, and fuel injectors. Replacement of faulty components is the usual solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component and location.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 9-speed automatic transmission has been a source of complaints, including rough shifting, hesitation, and difficulty finding the correct gear. This can be more noticeable during low-speed maneuvers or when accelerating.
    * Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. In some cases, valve body replacement or even transmission replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) - $5,000+ (for transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip out of gear or delay engagement into gear, causing a loss of power or a jerking sensation.
    * Solution: This issue may stem from low transmission fluid, faulty sensors, or internal damage. The specific solution depends on the root cause and may involve fluid replacement, sensor replacement, or transmission repair/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ depending on the repair needed
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of suspension components, such as ball joints, tie rod ends, and struts, leading to clunking noises, uneven tire wear, and poor handling. This seems more prevalent in vehicles frequently driven off-road.
    * Solution: Inspection of suspension components and replacement of worn parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per corner depending on the components needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system can experience freezing, crashing, or unresponsive touchscreens. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    * Solution: Attempting a system reset or software update. In some cases, the infotainment unit needs replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1,500+ (for unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning sensors, such as those for blind spot monitoring or parking assist, can lead to false alerts, failure to detect objects, or complete system failure.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty sensor and replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on location and type.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks (Sunroof/Moonroof)**
