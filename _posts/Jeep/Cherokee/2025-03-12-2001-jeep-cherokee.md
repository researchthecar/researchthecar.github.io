The 2001 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) is a compact SUV known for its off-road capability and simple, rugged design. It offered two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 and a 4.0L inline-6. The 4.0L was the more popular and powerful choice, producing around 190 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (AW4). Owners generally appreciate the Cherokee's reliability, off-road prowess, and straightforward maintenance. However, common complaints include aging components, rust, and occasionally rough ride quality.

**Summary**

The 2001 Jeep Cherokee, while generally reliable, does have some common issues related to its age. The 4.0L engine's cylinder head cracking and exhaust manifold issues are significant concerns. Rust is a major factor on the exterior, especially in areas with harsh winters. Suspension components also wear with age, requiring replacement. While many repairs are relatively affordable, rust repair or a complete engine overhaul can be costly. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle for these common problems and budget accordingly.
