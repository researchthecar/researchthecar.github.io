The 2000 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) is a compact SUV that's lauded for its off-road capability, simple design, and robust build. It was available with two main engine options: the 2.5L Inline-4 and the more popular 4.0L Inline-6. The 4.0L engine produces around 190 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Cherokee's ruggedness, straightforward mechanics, and aftermarket support, making it easy to modify and maintain. However, common complaints include its aging design, relatively poor fuel economy compared to modern SUVs, and the potential for rust and wear on older components.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

No Issues Found

**4.0L Inline-6**

*   **Cylinder Head Cracking (Typically around Cylinder #3)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine misfires. This is a common issue on the 0331 cylinder head used on some 2000-2001 4.0L engines. Coolant can leak internally, causing severe engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked cylinder head with a new or remanufactured head. Some owners opt to replace with an earlier TUPY casting head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold, diminishing as the engine warms up. Exhaust leaks can also cause poor fuel economy and potential sensor issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked exhaust manifold with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Adapter O-Rings Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak from the area of the oil filter adapter, leading to low oil pressure and potential engine damage if left unattended.
    *   Solution: Replace the O-rings on the oil filter adapter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**AW4 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears or shifts very hard and abruptly. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low fluid level.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change, valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2500+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially during light acceleration, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. May require also flushing the transmission fluid and checking for debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500

**Summary**

The 2000 Jeep Cherokee, while a capable and popular vehicle, does have some common issues. Engine-related issues, particularly the 0331 cylinder head cracking on the 4.0L, can be significant and costly. Suspension wear is typical for a vehicle of this age, and rust can be a major concern depending on the region where the vehicle was driven. Electrical issues such as sensor failures are also common. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues, particularly the cylinder head and rust, before purchasing. Overall, the cost of addressing these common problems can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the severity and extent of the repairs needed.
