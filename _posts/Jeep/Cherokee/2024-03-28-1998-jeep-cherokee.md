    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission fluid leak:** The transmission fluid pan or lines develop a leak, causing a loss of fluid.
    * Symptoms: Transmission slipping, delayed shifting, overheating.
    * Solution: Repair leak and replace transmission fluid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
* **Shift solenoid failure:** The solenoids that control gear shifting fail, causing transmission problems.
