**Introduction**

The 2023 Jeep Cherokee is a compact SUV renowned for its rugged design and off-road capabilities. It's powered by a 180-horsepower 2.4-liter inline-4 engine paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Other engine and transmission options include a 270-horsepower 3.2-liter V6 with the same 9-speed automatic transmission and a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine with an 8-speed automatic transmission, delivering 270 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Despite its off-road prowess, the Cherokee has received criticism for its interior quality and infotainment system.
