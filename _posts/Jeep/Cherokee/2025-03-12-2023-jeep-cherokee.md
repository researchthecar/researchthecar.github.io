The 2023 Jeep Cherokee is a compact SUV that offers a blend of on-road comfort and off-road capability. While it's appreciated for its user-friendly infotainment system and comfortable ride, some owners have noted concerns about fuel economy and overall value compared to competitors. The standard engine for the 2023 Cherokee is a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder producing 180 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque. The other available engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 270 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as the "low oil pressure" warning light illuminating or noticing a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: A potential fix is to replace the piston rings with an updated design. The specific design or part number for the improved rings is essential.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report turbocharger failure or malfunctions, often indicated by a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine compartment (whining, whistling), or the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity of the issue, the turbocharger may need to be repaired or replaced. Diagnostic codes should be checked for accurate diagnosis.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,800 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly during low-speed maneuvers or when transitioning between gears. This can manifest as clunking noises, hesitation, or a general lack of smoothness in gear changes.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions include transmission software updates or a transmission flush/service. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system can sometimes freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot while driving.
    *   Solution: Performing a "soft reset" (holding the power button) may temporarily resolve the issue. A software update from the dealer is the most likely solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update is covered under warranty) - $150+ (if out of warranty)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure of the backup camera, displaying a black screen or distorted image when the vehicle is in reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. If connections are secure, the camera itself may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poorly Sealed Tail Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation buildup inside the taillight housings, indicating a poor seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the taillight assembly with a properly sealed unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and attempt to secure the loose trim piece. This may involve adding felt padding or tightening fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY) - $200+ (if professional help is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Jeep Cherokee, while offering a comfortable ride and user-friendly technology, exhibits some recurring issues. Engine problems, particularly excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine and potential turbocharger issues in the 2.0L turbo, can be costly to address. Transmission issues related to harsh shifting are also a concern. Electrical glitches, especially with the infotainment system and backup camera, can be irritating. While some issues are minor and easily addressed, others represent potentially significant repair expenses. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
