The 2017 Jeep Cherokee is a compact SUV offering a blend of on-road comfort and off-road capability. It came with a choice of three engine options: a 2.4L Tigershark I4 producing 184 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, a 3.2L Pentastar V6 delivering 271 horsepower and 239 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.0L I4 producing 270 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Cherokee's comfortable ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and available four-wheel-drive systems for off-road adventures. Common complaints include the sometimes hesitant 9-speed transmission, and overall reliability concerns compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L Tigershark I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potentially engine knocking or damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: The piston rings could be redesigned to help seal the pistons better. In most cases, replacement of the pistons and rings, and potentially valve seals, is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling can occur at low speeds, or while idling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the multi-air actuator assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L Pentastar V6**

*   No Issues Found

**2.0L Turbocharged I4**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 9-speed automatic transmission has been known to exhibit harsh shifting, hesitation, and difficulty finding the correct gear. This can manifest as jerky acceleration, delayed response when shifting, and clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Software updates/reprogramming of the Transmission Control Module (TCM) can sometimes improve shift quality. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for software updates; $800 - $2,000+ for valve body replacement; $3,000 - $6,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls:
        *   Recall Number S28 / NHTSA 14V-530: This recall addresses a potential issue with the transmission software that could cause the vehicle to shift into neutral unexpectedly.
        *   Recall Number T79 / NHTSA 19V-156: This recall addresses a potential issue with the transmission park pawl that could prevent the vehicle from properly engaging "Park," increasing the risk of a rollaway.

**Suspension**

*   No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, and connectivity problems (Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto).
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve the issues. If the problem persists, the Uconnect module might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $150 for software updates (if available); $500 - $1,200+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a parasitic battery drain that can cause the battery to die overnight or after a few days of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This could involve checking for faulty modules, wiring issues, or accessories that are not shutting off properly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the sunroof area, potentially damaging the headliner and other interior components.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and resealing the sunroof drain tubes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the severity of the leak and damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Jeep Cherokee presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine issues, particularly excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L Tigershark, can lead to costly repairs. The 9-speed transmission is a known weak point, with shifting problems and potential for failure, which have been addressed by multiple recalls. Electrical glitches in the Uconnect system and battery drain issues can also be frustrating. Sunroof leaks can cause interior damage. While some issues are relatively minor and can be addressed with software updates or minor repairs, others can be more significant and require costly component replacements. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect the vehicle's service history, especially regarding transmission maintenance and oil consumption.
