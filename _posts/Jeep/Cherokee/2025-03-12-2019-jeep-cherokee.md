The 2019 Jeep Cherokee represents a mid-cycle refresh for the KL generation. It's available with three engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 270 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque, a 2.4L inline-4 producing 180 hp and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L Pentastar V6 generating 271 hp and 239 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Cherokee's comfortable ride, off-road capabilities (especially in Trailhawk trim), and updated infotainment system. Common dislikes include the sometimes-clunky 9-speed transmission and relatively poor fuel economy for some engine choices.
