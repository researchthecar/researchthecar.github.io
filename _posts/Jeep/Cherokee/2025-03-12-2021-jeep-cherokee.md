The 2021 Jeep Cherokee is a compact SUV offering a blend of on-road comfort and off-road capability. It comes with three engine options: a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 producing 270 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, a 2.4L Inline-4 producing 180 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L V6 producing 271 horsepower and 239 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Cherokee for its comfortable ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and available four-wheel-drive systems that provide good off-road performance. Common complaints include lackluster fuel economy (especially with the V6), a sometimes hesitant 9-speed transmission, and a higher price point compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2021 Jeep Cherokee presents a mix of positives and potential issues. While the comfortable ride and available 4x4 systems are appealing, potential engine problems (oil consumption in the 2.4L, misfires in the 2.0L) and transmission issues are significant concerns. Electrical issues with the Uconnect system and backup camera also surface. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely, from relatively inexpensive software updates to potentially costly engine or transmission replacements. Prospective buyers should be aware of these common issues and carefully inspect any used Cherokee before purchase.
