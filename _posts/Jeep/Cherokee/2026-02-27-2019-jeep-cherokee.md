### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Jeep Cherokee exhibits a moderate level of reliability, with the powertrain and electrical systems being the most frequent sources of reported issues. The 9-speed automatic transmission, in particular, has been a point of concern for some owners, with reports of harsh shifting and slipping. Engine-related problems, such as turbocharger issues on the 2.0L and oil cooler leaks on the 3.2L, also appear.
