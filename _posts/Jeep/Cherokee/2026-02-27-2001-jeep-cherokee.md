### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Jeep Cherokee, particularly with the popular 4.0L engine, is known for its durability but is not without its common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around potential head gasket failures and cracked cylinder heads on the 4.0L engines, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 42RE automatic, are also frequently reported. Electrical gremlins and rust, particularly in harsh climates, are other areas to watch for. While the suspension and interior components can experience wear, they are generally less problematic than the powertrain and electrical systems. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble are crucial for maintaining the reliability of a 2001 Cherokee.
