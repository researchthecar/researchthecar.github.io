The 2020 Jeep Cherokee is a compact SUV offering a blend of on-road comfort and off-road capability, particularly in the Trailhawk trim. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 180 hp and 171 lb-ft of torque, a 3.2L V6 making 271 hp and 239 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 generating 270 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Cherokee's user-friendly infotainment system, comfortable seats, and available 4x4 systems. Common complaints include the sometimes hesitant 9-speed transmission, fuel economy that can lag behind competitors, and a relatively small cargo area.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored. Symptoms include the "check engine" light illuminating due to low oil pressure, and potentially engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels frequently. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection is recommended to check for leaks or internal engine issues. In some cases, a piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**2.0L Turbo Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine misfires, particularly during cold starts or under heavy acceleration. This can result in rough idling, hesitation, and a noticeable loss of power. The "check engine" light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis typically involves checking the spark plugs, ignition coils, and fuel injectors. In some cases, software updates to the engine control unit (ECU) can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint is rough or jerky shifting, especially during low-speed maneuvers or when shifting between gears. Some owners also experience hesitation or delays when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) are often the first step. In some cases, replacing valve body components or even the entire transmission may be required, though this is less frequent.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (for software updates), $500-$2000+ (valve body replacement), $3,000 - $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure, with inability to shift or move. There may be loud noises coming from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission with a new or remanufactured unit is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, Crashing, Bluetooth connectivity problems, unresponsive touchscreen, and issues with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often the first step. In some cases, a replacement of the Uconnect head unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates), $500 - $1500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or excessive battery drain when the vehicle is not in use. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic drains from aftermarket accessories or faulty electrical components. A battery test is recommended. In some cases, replacing the battery or repairing the alternator can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (battery replacement), $300-$800+ (alternator replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, typically around the headliner, during rain or car washes.
    *   Solution: Inspect and clean the sunroof drain tubes to ensure they are not clogged. Re-sealing the sunroof may be necessary in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2020 Jeep Cherokee presents a mix of potential issues. The most commonly reported problems revolve around the 9-speed automatic transmission's shifting performance and the 2.4L engine's oil consumption. Electrical issues related to the Uconnect system and battery drain are also concerns. While many of these issues can be addressed with software updates or relatively minor repairs, some may require more costly component replacements. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially significant repair expenses, making careful inspection and a pre-purchase inspection advisable for potential buyers.
