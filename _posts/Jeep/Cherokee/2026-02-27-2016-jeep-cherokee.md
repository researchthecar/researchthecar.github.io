### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Jeep Cherokee presents a mixed reliability profile. The primary concerns revolve around the powertrain, specifically the 9-speed automatic transmission, which can exhibit issues with shifting quality and occasional slipping, potentially requiring software updates or more extensive repairs. Engine options, both the 2.4L Tigershark and 3.2L Pentastar, have seen reports of oil and coolant leaks, generally stemming from gasket or seal failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Uconnect infotainment system and keyless entry, are also noted, often resolvable with software updates but sometimes necessitating component replacement. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are generally considered reliable with no widespread systemic failures reported. Owners should be aware of potential transmission and engine leak issues when considering this model year.
