The 2015 Jeep Cherokee is a compact SUV offering a blend of on-road comfort and off-road capability, making it a popular choice for those seeking versatility. Engine options for the 2015 Cherokee include a 2.4L Tigershark I4 producing 184 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.2L Pentastar V6 generating 271 horsepower and 239 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Cherokee for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and available 4x4 systems that provide impressive off-road performance. However, common complaints include issues with the 9-speed transmission's shifting behavior, some engine reliability concerns, and electrical glitches.
