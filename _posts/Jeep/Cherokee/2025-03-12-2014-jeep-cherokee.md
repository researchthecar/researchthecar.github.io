The 2014 Jeep Cherokee marked a return to the Cherokee nameplate after a long hiatus, introducing a modern, crossover-style vehicle to the Jeep lineup. It was offered with three engine options: a 2.4L Tigershark inline-4 producing 184 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, a 3.2L Pentastar V6 making 271 horsepower and 239 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L I4 Turbocharged engine. The primary transmission was a 9-speed automatic. Many appreciated the Cherokee's comfortable ride, off-road capabilities (especially in Trailhawk trim), and stylish interior. However, the 9-speed transmission received criticism for its clunky shifting and reliability issues. Other common dislikes included the polarizing exterior styling and some reported electronic gremlins.

**Summary**

The 2014 Jeep Cherokee presents a mixed bag of reliability concerns. The most significant issues revolve around the 9-speed automatic transmission, with harsh shifting and potential failures being a common complaint, and software updates along with valve body replacements appear to be the most common solutions. The 2.4L Tigershark engine can suffer from excessive oil consumption, potentially leading to expensive repairs. Electrical issues with the Uconnect system and power liftgate are also relatively common. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major transmission or engine repairs can be costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's service history before purchasing.
