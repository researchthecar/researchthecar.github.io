Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2018 Jeep Cherokee, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2018 Jeep Cherokee is a compact SUV offering a balance of on-road comfort and off-road capability. It was available with three engine options: a 2.4L Tigershark inline-4 producing 184 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, a 3.2L Pentastar V6 producing 271 horsepower and 239 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 270 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Cherokee's comfortable ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and available four-wheel-drive systems. Common dislikes include the sometimes-sluggish 9-speed transmission and relatively small cargo area compared to competitors.
