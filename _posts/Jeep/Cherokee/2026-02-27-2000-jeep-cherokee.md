### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Jeep Cherokee, particularly with the venerable 4.0L inline-six engine, is known for its robust off-road capability and general durability. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as head gasket failures and cracked cylinder heads on the 4.0L, and transmission problems like slipping or overheating, especially with the 42RE automatic. Electrical gremlins, including instrument cluster and window regulator failures, are also frequently reported. Rust can be a significant concern, particularly in areas with harsh winters. While not without its flaws, many of these issues are well-documented and repairable, making the Cherokee a potentially rewarding vehicle for those willing to perform diligent maintenance and address known weak points.
