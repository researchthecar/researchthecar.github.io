The available engine options include a 2.4L Tigershark inline-4 producing 180 hp and 175 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 1.3L turbocharged inline-4 producing 177 hp and 210 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. The 1.3L engine is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission as well. Many owners appreciate the Renegade's unique look, compact size for city driving, and available four-wheel-drive system. Common complaints revolve around the vehicle's reliability, specifically issues with the transmission and electrical systems, and its fuel economy compared to other vehicles in the subcompact SUV class.

**Engine**

**2.4L Tigershark Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. In some cases, this can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored closely.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the severity. Some owners have had success with switching to a different oil viscosity or brand. In more severe cases, engine components like piston rings may need to be replaced.

Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failures, paired with transmission problems such as harsh shifting and slipping, are among the most concerning due to their potential for high repair costs. Electrical problems, particularly with the Uconnect system and battery drain, can be frequent and frustrating. While the Renegade has its strengths, these reliability issues are important to consider. The severity and cost of these problems can vary widely, but addressing them can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for major engine or transmission work.
