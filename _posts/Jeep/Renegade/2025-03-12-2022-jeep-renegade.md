Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints related to the 2022 Jeep Renegade, categorized by component, including subcategories for specific engine and transmission options.

The 2022 Jeep Renegade is a subcompact SUV known for its distinctive Jeep styling, off-road capabilities (especially in the Trailhawk trim), and user-friendly technology. Engine options include a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder MultiAir engine producing 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3-liter turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine that delivers 177 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Renegade's maneuverability and distinctive styling, but some dislike its fuel economy and the performance of the 9-speed transmission.

**Engine**

**2.4L MultiAir Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial. Possible causes include worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or PCV valve issues. A compression test and leak-down test can help pinpoint the source. Repairs can range from replacing the PCV valve to a more extensive engine overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve replacement) - $3000+ (Engine Overhaul)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their engine has stalled without warning.
    *   Solution: The PCM must be reprogrammed with the latest software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.3L Turbocharged Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of turbocharger failure, leading to a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or screeching), and potentially check engine lights.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger inspection and replacement if necessary. Diagnosis should include checking for boost leaks and oil supply issues to the turbo.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+

    *   Description/Symptoms: The 9-speed automatic transmission can exhibit rough or jerky shifting, especially between lower gears. Some owners also report hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes resolve shifting issues. In other cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software Update) - $4000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission Slipping between gear shifts is also common.
