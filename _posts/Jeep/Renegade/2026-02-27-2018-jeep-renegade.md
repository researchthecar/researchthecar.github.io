### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Jeep Renegade presents a mixed reliability profile. The engines, particularly the 2.4L Tigershark, have documented issues with oil consumption and stalling, while the 1.4L turbo can suffer from turbocharger problems. The 9-speed automatic transmission is a common source of complaints due to harsh shifting and potential failures. Electrical gremlins, especially with the Body Control Module and infotainment system, are also noted. Exterior water leaks and interior rattles are less severe but can impact owner satisfaction. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider the vehicle's maintenance history and any available extended warranties.
