The 2016 Jeep Renegade is a subcompact SUV that offers a unique blend of Jeep's off-road capability with a smaller, more fuel-efficient package. Engine options included a 1.4L MultiAir Turbo inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 6-speed manual transmission, and a 2.4L Tigershark inline-4 producing 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Renegade's quirky styling, available off-road capabilities (especially in the Trailhawk trim), and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include its sometimes sluggish acceleration, especially with the 2.4L engine and 9-speed automatic, and its relatively small cargo space.

**Engine**

**2.4L Tigershark Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than normal between oil changes. The exact cause is often difficult to pinpoint, but potential issues include faulty piston rings, worn valve seals, or issues with the PCV system.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity and cause, solutions can range from using a heavier weight oil and monitoring oil levels, to more extensive repairs such as replacing piston rings or valve seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the engine has the tendency to stall or shut off while the vehicle is idle or being driven.
    * Solution: The solution could be reflashing the PCM. Replacing the PCM might be required in some cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1200+ depending on the needed fix.
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.4L MultiAir Turbo Inline-4**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports indicate that some 1.4L turbo engines experience premature turbocharger failure. Symptoms include a loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and unusual noises from the turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement is typically required. It's important to diagnose the root cause of the failure (e.g., oil starvation, excessive heat) to prevent recurrence.

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (paired with 2.4L engine)**

    *   Description/Symptoms: The 9-speed automatic transmission has been a source of complaints regarding rough or delayed shifting, hesitation when accelerating, and difficulty finding the correct gear. This can result in a jerky driving experience and reduced fuel efficiency.
    *   Solution: In some cases, software updates or transmission control module (TCM) reflashing can improve shifting behavior. In more severe cases, transmission replacement or rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for software updates; $3000 - $6000+ for transmission replacement/rebuild.
    *   Recalls:
