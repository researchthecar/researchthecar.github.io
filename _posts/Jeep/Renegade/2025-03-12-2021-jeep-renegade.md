The 2021 Jeep Renegade is a subcompact SUV that offers a blend of Jeep's traditional rugged styling with a more city-friendly size. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L Tigershark inline-4 producing 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque and a 1.3L turbocharged inline-4 making 177 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Renegade's distinctive appearance, off-road capability (especially in the Trailhawk trim), and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints include the 9-speed automatic transmission's sometimes hesitant shifting, the relatively small cargo space, and fuel economy that doesn't always meet expectations.

**Engine**

**1.3L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels frequently and topping off as needed. More extensive solutions could involve replacing piston rings or other engine components if the consumption is severe, but diagnosis is needed to determine cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: There have been reports of premature turbocharger failure. Symptoms include loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling) from the engine, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Tigershark Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 1.3L, some owners report excessive oil consumption with the 2.4L engine, necessitating frequent oil top-offs.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed. In severe cases, internal engine repairs may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Rough or Hesitant Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have complained about rough shifting, hesitation, and delayed gear changes, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is "hunting" for the right gear.
    *   Solution: Software updates (TCU recalibration) by the dealer may improve shifting behavior. In some cases, transmission valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for software updates, $800 - $2000+ for valve body replacement, $3000 - $6000+ for full transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping can manifest as the engine revving high without corresponding acceleration, or a feeling that the transmission is not fully engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial to determine the cause of the slipping. This could range from low transmission fluid to internal damage requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid check/fill) to $3000 - $6000+ (transmission rebuild or replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system can freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealer can sometimes resolve these issues. In some cases, the Uconnect module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update covered under warranty) to $500 - $1500+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may fail to display an image, show a distorted image, or intermittently malfunction.
    *   Solution: Check the camera wiring and connections. If the wiring is intact, the camera unit itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Loose or Detached Trim Pieces**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported exterior trim pieces, particularly around the wheel wells or roof rails, becoming loose or detaching.
    *   Solution: Reattaching the trim pieces with adhesive or replacing damaged clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the part and damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have mentioned experiencing rattling noises from various areas within the cabin, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the rattle and using foam padding, tape, or other materials to dampen the vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY fix) to $100 - $500+ (if professional help is needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Jeep Renegade presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine oil consumption and transmission problems (rough shifting, slipping) appear to be the most significant concerns, potentially leading to costly repairs. Electrical glitches with the Uconnect system and backup camera are also relatively common, though often less expensive to fix. Exterior and interior trim issues are generally minor annoyances. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history, look for signs of excessive oil consumption, and test drive the vehicle thoroughly to assess the transmission's performance. Addressing these potential issues proactively can help avoid unpleasant surprises down the road.
