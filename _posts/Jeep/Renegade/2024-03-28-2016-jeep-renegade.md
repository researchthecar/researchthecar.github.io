**Introduction**

The 2016 Jeep Renegade is a compact SUV that combines rugged off-road capabilities with urban maneuverability. It's available with two engine options: a 1.4L turbocharged inline-four producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-four producing 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 9-speed automatic transmission.

The Renegade is praised for its spacious interior, off-road prowess, and unique styling, but it's criticized for its noisy cabin, lackluster fuel economy, and occasional transmission issues.
