The 2015 Jeep Renegade marked the introduction of a subcompact SUV with distinctive styling and off-road aspirations. Engine options included a 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. The other engine option was a 2.4L Tigershark four-cylinder engine producing 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciated the Renegade's unique design, fuel efficiency (with the 1.4L turbo), and available off-road capabilities, especially in the Trailhawk trim. Common dislikes included the sometimes sluggish performance of the 2.4L engine, the nine-speed automatic transmission's occasional rough shifting, and some reliability concerns.
