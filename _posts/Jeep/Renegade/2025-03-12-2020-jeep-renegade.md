Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2020 Jeep Renegade, organized by category and powertrain configuration, and formatted for your website.

The 2020 Jeep Renegade is a subcompact SUV that offers a unique blend of Jeep's off-road capability and urban practicality. It comes with two engine options: a 2.4L Tigershark inline-4 producing 180 hp and 175 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3L turbocharged inline-4 generating 177 hp and 210 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Renegade's distinctive styling, off-road prowess (especially in Trailhawk trim), and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some dislike its smaller cargo area, occasionally sluggish acceleration, and fuel economy that isn't class-leading.
