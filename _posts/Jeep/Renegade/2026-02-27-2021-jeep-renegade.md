### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Jeep Renegade presents a mixed reliability profile. The 1.3L Turbo engine has shown some susceptibility to oil leaks and turbocharger issues, while the 2.4L Tigershark is more prone to significant oil consumption and coolant leaks, which can be costly to repair. The 9-speed automatic transmission can exhibit shifting problems that may require software updates or more extensive repairs. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components generally appear to be robust, with fewer widespread complaints. Prospective buyers should be aware of the potential engine and transmission concerns and factor in possible repair costs, especially if opting for the 2.4L engine.
