The 2018 Jeep Renegade is a subcompact SUV that offers a blend of Jeep's rugged heritage and urban practicality. It's known for its distinctive styling, off-road capability (especially in the Trailhawk trim), and user-friendly technology. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. Engine options for the 2018 Renegade include a 2.4L Tigershark inline-4 engine producing 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque and a 1.4L MultiAir Turbo inline-4 engine producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.4L engine is paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners appreciate the Renegade's unique styling and available off-road features, but some dislike its smaller cargo space, fuel economy and the sometimes-rough shifting of the 9-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.4L Tigershark I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil more frequently and potential low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive (more than 1 quart per 1,000 miles), a dealer may perform an oil consumption test. In some cases, replacement of piston rings or other engine components might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the repairs needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine stalling or hesitating, particularly during acceleration or at low speeds.
    *   Solution: The fix depends on the cause. A mechanic will need to diagnose the issue, which could range from a faulty sensor (such as the mass airflow sensor) to issues with the fuel system or ignition system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L MultiAir Turbo I4**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report potential issues with the turbocharger, including failures or leaks. Symptoms may include a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine (whining or whistling), and/or the presence of smoke.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger inspection. If the turbocharger is faulty, it may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L engine)**

*   **Rough or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a very common complaint. Owners experience harsh shifts, delayed shifts, or difficulty finding the correct gear. The transmission may "clunk" or "jerk" during shifting.
    *   Solution: Software updates have been released to address the shifting issues. Some owners report improvement after a transmission control module (TCM) re-flash. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for a software update) to $4,000+ (for a transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported complete transmission failure. Symptoms may include an inability to shift, complete loss of power, or loud noises coming from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with premature wear of suspension components, particularly the rear shocks and struts. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, clunking noises from the suspension, and decreased handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components (shocks, struts, bushings, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per axle, depending on the components replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the Uconnect infotainment system are common. These include screen freezing, Bluetooth connectivity issues, GPS malfunction, and system reboots.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often released to address Uconnect issues. In some cases, a hard reset of the system or replacement of the Uconnect module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for a software update) to $800+ (for module replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the battery draining prematurely, even when the vehicle is not in use. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to determine the cause of the battery drain. Common causes include a parasitic drain from a faulty module or accessory, or a failing battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for a new battery, $100 - $1,000+ for diagnostic and electrical repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported water leaks, particularly around the sunroof/moonroof area and the liftgate. This can lead to water damage to the interior.
    *   Solution: Inspection and repair of the sunroof/moonroof seals or liftgate seals. Cleaning of drain passages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Jeep Renegade has a mix of relatively minor and more significant potential issues. The most common and concerning issues are related to the 9-speed automatic transmission, which can suffer from rough shifting and, in some cases, complete failure. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption and turbocharger problems, are also a concern for some owners. Electrical problems with the Uconnect system and battery drain are common but often less severe. Suspension wear and water leaks are also reported. The severity of these issues varies, but the potential cost of repairs, especially for transmission or engine problems, can be significant. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used 2018 Renegade before purchase.
