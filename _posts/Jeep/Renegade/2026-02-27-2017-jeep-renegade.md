### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Jeep Renegade presents a mixed reliability picture. The 1.4L turbo engine is prone to turbocharger issues and oil leaks, while the 2.4L engine can suffer from significant oil consumption and stalling problems. The 9-speed automatic transmission is a notable weak point, with common complaints of harsh shifting and occasional failures. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and Uconnect system glitches, are also reported. Exterior water leaks and interior HVAC issues are less common but still documented. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues, especially concerning the powertrain and transmission, and consider a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
