The 2017 Jeep Renegade is a subcompact SUV known for its quirky styling and off-road capability for its class. It comes with a choice of two engines: a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual transmission, and a 2.4-liter four-cylinder producing 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its distinctive design and maneuverability, but some dislike its fuel economy and the performance of the 9-speed automatic transmission.
