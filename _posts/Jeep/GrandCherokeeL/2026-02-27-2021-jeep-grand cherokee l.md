# 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L

### Overview
The 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L, a new entrant in the full-size SUV segment, offers a blend of capability and comfort. It is built on a unibody platform, sharing its underpinnings with other Stellantis large SUVs. This generation introduced a longer wheelbase to accommodate a third row of seating. Initial reliability data suggests a generally solid performance, though as with any new model, some areas warrant attention. The powertrain options are a key focus for potential buyers, and their long-term durability is a significant factor in overall ownership satisfaction. This analysis focuses on documented technical issues beyond routine maintenance.

### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L demonstrates a generally strong reliability profile for its debut year, particularly with its core powertrain components (3.6L Pentastar V6 and 5.7L HEMI V8 engines, paired with the 8-speed automatic transmission), which show no widespread issues. The primary areas of concern are related to the optional Quadra-Lift air suspension system, which can experience compressor malfunctions or air spring leaks, and some electrical gremlins, notably infotainment system glitches and occasional premature 12V battery failures. These issues are not universal but represent the most commonly reported technical problems. Overall, the Grand Cherokee L is a competent vehicle, but potential buyers opting for the air suspension should be aware of these specific potential repair costs.
