Alright, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee L, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee L marked a significant redesign and the introduction of a three-row variant to the popular Grand Cherokee lineup. Powertrain options included the base 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine, producing 293 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, a 5.7L Hemi V8 engine that produces 357 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 PHEV. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praised the Grand Cherokee L for its spacious interior, updated technology, and improved ride quality compared to previous generations. However, some common criticisms included electronic glitches, build quality issues, and less-than-stellar fuel economy, especially with the V8.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the "low oil" warning light illuminating, and visible blue smoke from the exhaust in severe cases.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Chrysler has advised replacing the valve stem seals, pistons, or piston rings. However, there is no known permanent fix and Chrysler will only address issues when the oil consumption is within acceptable parameters for them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and parts replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Tick/Knock Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported an intermittent tick or knock noise coming from the engine, especially when cold. Some theorize this to be "Hemi Tick," which is associated with the MDS (Multi-Displacement System).
    *   Solution: There is no definitive fix, with some attempting oil additives or thicker oil. In some extreme cases, engine replacement has been done.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0-$10,000+, if engine replacement is performed
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged I4 PHEV**

*   **Engine Shut Off Due to Misfire**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported the engine shuts off due to a misfire issue.
    *   Solution: Replace the spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop has also been noted.
    *   Solution: Some have had success with transmission control module (TCM) software updates. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or full transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $5,000+ (for transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicles equipped with the optional air suspension system have experienced issues such as the system failing to maintain proper ride height, the vehicle leaning to one side, or complete system failure. Error messages related to the air suspension system may also appear on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair can range from replacing a faulty air strut or compressor to addressing leaks in the air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system is prone to freezing, crashing, or exhibiting slow response times. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue, but some owners have required replacement of the Uconnect system's head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1,500+ (for head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: **Recall Number:** 22V-176 (Affects certain Uconnect Systems - screen goes blank)

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, including those related to the parking assist, blind-spot monitoring, and adaptive cruise control systems, have been reported to malfunction. This can result in false warnings or the systems not functioning as intended.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the sensor and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee L, while a significant upgrade in terms of interior space and technology, has its share of issues. The most concerning are related to the electrical system (Uconnect), and the air suspension (if equipped). Engine issues, such as oil consumption on the V6 and ticking noises on the V8, are also prevalent. Transmission issues can occur with any engine. The cost to repair these issues can vary from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand for engine or transmission repairs, making it important for potential buyers to be aware of these potential pitfalls.
