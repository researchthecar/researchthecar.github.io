The 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L marked the introduction of the fifth generation Grand Cherokee and offered a three-row configuration for the first time. It was available with three engine options: a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 290 horsepower and 257 lb-ft of torque, a 5.7L Hemi V8 delivering 357 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 producing 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque in the 4xe Plug-In Hybrid model. All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Grand Cherokee L's luxurious interior, smooth ride, and spaciousness, but some common complaints included electrical issues, transmission issues, and build quality concerns.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illumination. Often related to faulty ignition coils or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils or fuel injectors. Diagnose and repair any vacuum leaks that may be causing the misfire.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the number of coils/injectors replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking sound emanating from the engine, particularly at idle or low speeds. Believed to be related to the roller lifters, some owners report it worsening over time.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the issue may be deemed "normal" by dealerships. More extensive repairs could involve replacing the lifters and/or camshaft, a costly procedure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on diagnosis and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored.
    * Solution: Some owners have had success with oil consumption tests and potential engine component replacements (piston rings, valve stem seals) under warranty.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5000+ depending on diagnosis and repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged I4 (4xe Plug-In Hybrid)**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. Some owners describe hesitation or delays when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) may improve shift quality. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $6,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates to engage a gear, or slips out of gear while driving. This can be intermittent or persistent.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair any leaks. The 8-speed automatic transmission may have issues with the valve body which can cause the transmission to slip. Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) may improve shift quality. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $6,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Grand Cherokee L offers an available air suspension system (Quadra-Lift). Problems include the vehicle not raising or lowering properly, a "service air suspension" warning light, or the compressor failing.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty air struts, the air suspension compressor, or ride height sensors. Check for air leaks in the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently. This can affect navigation, audio, climate controls, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealership may resolve some issues. In some cases, the Uconnect module itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $1,500+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty readings or complete failure of driver-assistance systems like blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, parking sensors, and adaptive cruise control. Warning lights illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty sensors. Recalibration of the systems may also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ per sensor replacement and recalibration.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. May lead to difficulty starting or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and address any parasitic draws in the electrical system. Replace the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement. Diagnosing and fixing parasitic drains can vary widely in cost.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks originating from the sunroof area, often noticeable in the headliner or interior trim.

**Summary**

The 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Electrical problems are common, especially with the Uconnect system and various sensors. Transmission concerns (harsh shifting) are another frequent complaint. Engine issues, like the "Hemi tick", are less common but can be costly to address. While not every vehicle will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of them and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's systems before purchasing. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, from minor software updates to major engine or transmission work, impacting the overall ownership experience.
