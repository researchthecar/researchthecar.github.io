The 2024 Jeep Compass is a compact SUV that aims to blend Jeep's off-road heritage with everyday practicality. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. What people often appreciate about the Compass is its updated interior, user-friendly technology, and standard safety features.
