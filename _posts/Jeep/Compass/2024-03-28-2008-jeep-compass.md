**Summary**

The 2008 Jeep Compass is known for some reliability issues, particularly with its 3.7L V6 engine and automatic transmission. While the engine issues can be costly to repair, the suspension and electrical problems are generally less severe and expensive. The interior issues are mostly minor, but the climate control module failure can be more significant. Overall, the Compass is not the most reliable SUV in its class, but it offers decent fuel economy and capability when running properly.
