### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Jeep Compass exhibits some notable reliability concerns, primarily centered around its powertrain and electrical systems. The 2.4L Tigershark engine is prone to excessive oil consumption and issues with its intake manifold, while both the 6-speed and 9-speed automatic transmissions can suffer from harsh shifting, hesitation, and overheating, particularly the 9-speed. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also reported. While the suspension, exterior, and interior components generally fare better, these powertrain and electrical issues can lead to significant repair costs and a less than ideal ownership experience. Prospective buyers should factor in potential maintenance and repair expenses.
