### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Jeep Compass presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.0L engine and manual transmission generally appear robust with no significant widespread issues. However, the 2.4L engine can be prone to oil leaks, and the CVT transmission has been associated with hesitation, shuddering, and overheating, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues, particularly with power windows and sensors, are also noted. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor can fail. Owners should be particularly mindful of the CVT's condition and maintenance history. While not plagued by universal problems, potential buyers should be aware of these specific vulnerabilities.
