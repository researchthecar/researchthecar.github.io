The 2009 Jeep Compass is a compact SUV that aimed to offer Jeep styling and some off-road capability in a smaller, more fuel-efficient package. However, it's often criticized for its underwhelming performance, cheap interior materials, and unrefined driving experience. Owners often like the Compass for its affordability and Jeep's iconic styling. Dislikes typically revolve around its reliability and lack of power. The 2009 Compass offered two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 generating 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual (available with both engines) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) which was more common.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls unexpectedly, particularly at idle or low speeds.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause such as a faulty throttle position sensor, dirty mass airflow sensor, or vacuum leak, and replacing the faulty component
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between changes, requiring frequent top-offs. Visible blue smoke may be emitted from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Can vary greatly based on cause, from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping, hesitation, shuddering, or complete loss of power. The transmission may enter "limp mode."
    *   Solution: CVT rebuild or replacement is often the only viable solution. Fluid changes *may* offer temporary relief, but are not a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is known for overheating in certain driving conditions. The overheating condition may cause the vehicle to reduce power or enter a limp mode.
    *   Solution: Install an auxiliary transmission cooler. Perform more frequent transmission fluid changes. Avoid conditions that put high amounts of load on the transmission such as towing or off-roading.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose or unstable handling.
    *   Solution: Replace worn bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems such as stalling, no-start condition, fuel pump not activating, wipers not working, or lights malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Windshield Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windshield wipers stop working intermittently or completely.
    *   Solution: Replace the windshield wiper motor
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, especially on the undercarriage, door seams, and around the wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, panel replacement, or rustproofing treatments.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Loose or Broken Interior Trim**
    * Description/Symptoms: Interior trim pieces such as door panels, dashboard components, or center console pieces become loose or break easily.
    * Solution: Replacing or reattaching the affected trim pieces.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Jeep Compass can be a problematic vehicle. The CVT transmission is a major source of concern, with potential for costly repairs. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption can also lead to significant expenses. Electrical problems related to the TIPM can be frustrating and difficult to diagnose. While some issues are relatively minor, the potential for major mechanical failures makes it crucial to thoroughly inspect any used 2009 Compass and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of these issues ranges from annoying electrical glitches to major transmission failures, with repair costs spanning a wide spectrum.
