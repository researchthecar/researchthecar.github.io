**2016 Jeep Compass**

The 2016 Jeep Compass is a compact SUV available with three engine options: a 160-horsepower 2.0-liter inline-4, a 180-horsepower 2.4-liter inline-4, or a 2.0-liter turbo diesel inline-4 producing 172 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, or a 9-speed automatic, depending on the engine configuration.

The Compass received praise for its off-road capabilities, spacious interior, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, it was also criticized for its lackluster acceleration, poor fuel economy, and cramped back seat.
