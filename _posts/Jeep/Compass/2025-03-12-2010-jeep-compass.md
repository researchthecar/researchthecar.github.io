The 2010 Jeep Compass is a compact SUV that received mixed reviews. Available engines included a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual, or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciated the Compass's fuel efficiency and affordability, while others criticized its lackluster performance, cheap interior, and reliability issues. Common complaints include engine problems, transmission issues (especially with the CVT), and electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil frequently.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a PCV valve replacement can resolve the issue. If consumption is severe, piston ring replacement or engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 (PCV Valve), $2,000 - $5,000+ (Piston Rings or Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder Engine**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls intermittently, particularly at idle or low speeds.
    *   Solution: Throttle body cleaning or replacement. Inspect and replace any faulty sensors (crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT is a common source of complaints. Symptoms include slipping, hesitation, jerking, whining noises, and complete transmission failure. The transmission may overheat, and the vehicle may enter limp mode.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid changes may temporarily alleviate some issues, but replacement of the CVT is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of ball joints, tie rod ends, and wheel bearings, leading to clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components. Regular inspections and maintenance can help prevent premature wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiper Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Wipers stop working intermittently, or completely fail
    * Solution: Replace the wiper motor
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls many of the vehicle's electrical functions, and failures can lead to a variety of problems, including fuel pump relay failure (causing stalling or no-start conditions), intermittent starting, and malfunctioning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the undercarriage and body panels, particularly in areas with high road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, body panel replacement. Rust prevention measures such as regular washing and undercoating can help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the severity of the rust.

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sun visors break easily or become loose and droop down, obstructing the driver's view.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sun visor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150

**Summary**

The 2010 Jeep Compass has several known issues, with the CVT transmission being a major concern due to its high failure rate and replacement cost. Engine problems, electrical issues, and suspension wear are also common complaints. Overall, the 2010 Compass has below-average reliability, and potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of repairs when considering a purchase. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and the costs can vary significantly depending on the specific problem.
