**Introduction**

The 2023 Jeep Compass is a compact SUV offered with two engine and transmission options: a 2.4L Tigershark engine paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and a 1.3L turbocharged engine mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission. The 2.4L engine produces 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.3L turbo engine delivers 177 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. The Compass's strengths include its stylish design, comfortable interior, and off-road capabilities.
