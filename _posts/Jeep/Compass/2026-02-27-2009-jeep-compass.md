### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Jeep Compass presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly oil leaks in the engines and potential problems with the CVT transmission, such as hesitation or overheating. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can also wear out, leading to ride quality issues and noises. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module, can manifest in various ways. Exterior concerns include rust, especially in harsh climates, and headlight hazing. Interiorly, HVAC blower motors and infotainment system glitches are noted. While not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
