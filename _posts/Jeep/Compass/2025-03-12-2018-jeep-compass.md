The 2018 Jeep Compass marked the second year of the redesigned model, offering a more refined and modern take on the compact SUV. The standard engine was a 2.4-liter Tigershark inline-4 cylinder engine, producing 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual (FWD only), a 6-speed automatic (FWD only), and a 9-speed automatic (4x4 models). What people like about the 2018 Compass is its improved styling, available 4x4 capability, and comfortable ride. Dislikes often center around the relatively lackluster performance of the 2.4L engine, especially when paired with the 9-speed automatic transmission, and some concerns regarding reliability.

**Engine**

**2.4L Tigershark I4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, engine knocking, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    * Solution: In some cases, the problem may be related to faulty PCV valves or piston rings. A dealer inspection is required to diagnose the root cause and determine the appropriate repair, which might involve replacing the PCV valve, piston rings, or in severe cases, the entire engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (PCV Valve), $1,500 - $4,000+ (Piston Rings or Engine Replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the engine stalling unexpectedly while driving, posing a safety hazard. This can occur at various speeds and driving conditions.
    * Solution: The cause can vary, ranging from a faulty crankshaft position sensor, throttle body issues, or fuel delivery problems. Diagnosis involves checking for error codes, inspecting the sensors, and testing fuel pressure. Repair might involve replacing the faulty sensor or cleaning/replacing the throttle body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the cause
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (FWD Models Only)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Many owners have complained about rough or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation during acceleration is also a common complaint.
    * Solution: This issue can be caused by a faulty transmission control module (TCM), valve body issues, or software problems. A transmission flush and software update may resolve the issue, but in some cases, replacing the TCM or valve body might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (Flush and Software Update), $500 - $1500+ (TCM or Valve Body Replacement).

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced transmission slipping, where the engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed.
    * Solution: This can be due to low transmission fluid, worn clutches, or internal damage. A transmission inspection is necessary to determine the cause. A fluid change or, in severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Fluid Change), $2,500 - $5,000+ (Rebuild or Replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of suspension components, such as struts, shocks, and bushings. Symptoms include clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn components is necessary. The cost will depend on the specific parts that need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per axle, depending on parts and labor.
