Okay, here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2013 Jeep Compass, categorized as requested.

The 2013 Jeep Compass is a compact SUV that aims to provide Jeep's off-road styling in a more affordable and fuel-efficient package. It came standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque. An optional, more powerful 2.4-liter inline-4 was also available, delivering 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic (FWD only with the 2.4L), and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate the Compass's affordability and Jeep styling. However, common complaints include lackluster performance, particularly with the 2.0L engine and CVT transmission, below-average fuel economy for its class, and a generally unrefined driving experience compared to competitors.
