**Summary**

The 2014 Jeep Compass has a number of potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns relate to the CVT transmission, which can be costly to repair or replace. Engine issues, particularly excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine, and electrical problems with the TIPM are also common. Suspension issues are less severe, but still contribute to the overall ownership experience. Due to the severity and high cost of some repairs, potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed and carefully consider the vehicle's service history.
