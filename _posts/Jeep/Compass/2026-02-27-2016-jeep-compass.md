### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Jeep Compass presents a mixed reliability profile. While the chassis and basic mechanicals can be durable with proper maintenance, common issues tend to surface in the powertrain (especially the CVT transmission), electrical systems (BCM and infotainment), and susceptibility to rust in certain climates.
