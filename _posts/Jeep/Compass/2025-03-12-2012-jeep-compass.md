The 2012 Jeep Compass is a compact SUV that offers a blend of affordability and off-road capability, though it is more geared towards on-road driving. The 2012 model offered two engine choices: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine generating 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a five-speed manual, a six-speed automatic (available only with the 2.4L engine and the Freedom Drive II off-road package), and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Compass's price point and available off-road features with the Freedom Drive II package. Common complaints include lackluster fuel economy, a noisy cabin, and unrefined engine performance.

**Summary**

The 2012 Jeep Compass has several common issues. The most concerning are CVT transmission problems, which can be costly to repair. Oil consumption in the 2.4L engine is also a relatively frequent issue. Electrical problems, particularly with the TIPM, can cause a range of frustrating malfunctions. Suspension and rust issues are typical for vehicles of this age. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, making it crucial to thoroughly inspect a used 2012 Jeep Compass before purchase, particularly checking the CVT transmission, engine oil levels, and electrical systems.
