The 2022 Jeep Compass represents a significant refresh for the model, aiming to elevate its appeal in the competitive compact SUV segment. The standard engine is a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder producing 177 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. It comes standard in front-wheel drive with a six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often praise the Compass for its improved interior styling, user-friendly technology, and comfortable ride. However, some criticisms include the engine's lack of responsiveness, fuel economy not living up to expectations, and some reliability concerns.
