### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Jeep Compass presents a mixed reliability profile. Owners should be aware of potential issues with the CVT transmission, particularly concerning hesitation and overheating, which can lead to costly repairs. Engine-related concerns often revolve around oil and coolant leaks, which are manageable with timely maintenance. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and alternator failures, can also arise. On the exterior, rust can be a concern in certain climates. While the manual transmission appears more robust, the overall reliability leans towards average for its class and age. Regular maintenance, especially for the CVT, and prompt attention to any warning signs are crucial for maximizing the lifespan and minimizing unexpected expenses of a 2010 Jeep Compass.
