The 2007 Jeep Compass was the inaugural year for this compact SUV, offering a budget-friendly entry into the Jeep lineup. It came standard with a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. An optional 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque was also available. The 2.4L engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), while the 2.0L engine was only available with the 5-speed manual. Owners often appreciate the Compass's fuel economy and affordability, but common complaints include its unrefined CVT transmission, lackluster interior, and perceived lack of off-road capability compared to other Jeeps.

**Summary**

The 2007 Jeep Compass, while an affordable entry-level SUV, is prone to several issues. The CVT transmission is a major area of concern due to its potential for slipping and overheating. Electrical issues stemming from the TIPM can also be frustrating. Suspension wear, rust, and interior cracking are also common complaints. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission replacement or TIPM repair, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any 2007 Compass before purchasing.
