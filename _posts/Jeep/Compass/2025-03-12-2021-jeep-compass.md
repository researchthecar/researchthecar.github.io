Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2021 Jeep Compass, formatted for your website, focusing on specific problems and solutions:

The 2021 Jeep Compass is a compact SUV that offers a blend of style and practicality. It's generally praised for its updated interior compared to previous models, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, it's also criticized for its somewhat underpowered engine and unrefined transmission. The standard engine is a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder engine that produces 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. It's paired with either a 6-speed automatic transmission (FWD models) or a 9-speed automatic transmission (4x4 models). While no other engine options are available, understanding potential issues with the existing engine and transmission configurations is crucial for potential buyers.

**Engine**

**2.4L I4 Engine (FWD models with 6-speed Automatic Transmission)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, engine knocking, and eventually, engine failure.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a PCV valve replacement will resolve the issue. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement or complete engine replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 (PCV Valve), $3,000 - $7,000+ (Engine Repair/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L I4 Engine (4x4 models with 9-speed Automatic Transmission)**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly while driving, especially at low speeds or when coming to a stop. This can be a safety hazard.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is needed to determine the root cause. Potential solutions include software updates to the engine control module (ECM), replacement of faulty sensors (crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor), or addressing fuel delivery issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (FWD models)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifting between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission software update to recalibrate shift points may alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, a transmission fluid flush and filter change could help. In severe cases, internal transmission repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (Software Update/Fluid Change), $2,000 - $4,000+ (Transmission Repair/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (4x4 models)**

*   **Hesitation and Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between pressing the accelerator pedal and the vehicle moving, especially from a standstill or after coasting. Can also include clunking sounds when shifting.
    *   Solution: Start with a software update to the transmission control module (TCM). If that doesn't resolve the issue, inspect the transmission fluid level and condition. In some cases, valve body replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (Software Update), $500 - $1,500+ (Valve Body Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of ball joints and bushings, leading to clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn-out components. Ensure proper alignment after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash randomly. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset (check the owner's manual for instructions). If the issue persists, a software update from the dealership may be necessary. In rare cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Reset/Update), $500 - $1500+ (Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain quickly, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently, leading to difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested for proper function. Check for parasitic draws (electrical components drawing power when the vehicle is off). Potential culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty sensors, or a malfunctioning module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Battery Replacement), $100 - $500+ (Parasitic Draw Diagnosis and Repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, often through the sunroof, windshield, or door seals.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and reseal the affected area. This may involve replacing weather stripping or applying sealant.
