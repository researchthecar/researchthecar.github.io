### Overview
The 2012 Jeep Compass, a compact SUV, aimed to offer a blend of practicality and off-road capability. While it presented a more affordable entry into the Jeep brand, its reliability can be a mixed bag, with certain powertrain configurations and specific components showing more propensity for issues than others. Owners have reported a range of concerns, particularly related to the powertrain and some electrical systems. However, for those who maintain their vehicles diligently, the Compass can still serve as a functional daily driver. This analysis focuses on documented common mechanical and electrical faults, excluding routine maintenance and standard wear and tear.

### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Jeep Compass presents a mixed reliability profile. Owners should be particularly aware of potential issues with the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), which can exhibit hesitation and shuddering, and the 6-speed automatic, which may experience harsh shifting. Engine oil and cooling system leaks are also noted concerns across both available engine options. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module and alternator, can lead to frustrating and costly repairs. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor may require attention. While not universally problematic, prospective buyers should factor in potential maintenance costs and consider vehicles with a well-documented service history.
