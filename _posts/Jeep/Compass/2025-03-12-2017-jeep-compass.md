Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2017 Jeep Compass, formatted for your website and accuracy.

The 2017 Jeep Compass marked the introduction of the second generation, offering a more refined and modern take on the compact SUV. Engine options include a 2.4-liter Tigershark inline-4 engine producing 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices varied depending on the trim level and drivetrain configuration, including a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic (primarily for front-wheel-drive models), and a 9-speed automatic (primarily for four-wheel-drive models). Owners often praise the Compass for its updated styling, improved interior quality compared to previous generations, and its off-road capability, especially in the Trailhawk trim. Criticisms often focus on the vehicle's performance, particularly with the 2.4-liter engine, and the sometimes-clunky operation of the 9-speed automatic transmission.
