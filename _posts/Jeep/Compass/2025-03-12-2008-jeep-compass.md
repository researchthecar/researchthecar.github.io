The 2008 Jeep Compass was Jeep's entry into the compact SUV market, offering car-like handling and fuel efficiency with Jeep styling. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 (158 hp, 141 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.4L inline-4 (172 hp, 165 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (only available on some trims with the 2.0L or 2.4L engines) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Compass was praised for its affordability and fuel economy. Common complaints included the weak engine performance, especially with the CVT, and cheap interior materials. Reliability issues were also a significant concern for many owners.

**Engine**

**2.0L I4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**2.4L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the 2.4L engine can start consuming excessive amounts of oil, sometimes requiring a quart or more every 1,000 miles. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, visible blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: There isn't a universal fix. Some owners have had success with replacing the PCV valve, while others have needed to replace the piston rings or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve) - $1500-$4000+ (piston rings/engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission in the 2008 Jeep Compass is a known weak point. Owners report slipping, hesitation, erratic shifting, and complete transmission failure. These issues often manifest after 80,000-120,000 miles.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT is often the only viable solution. Some have tried fluid changes, but this rarely provides a long-term fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Suspension Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front end components such as ball joints, tie rod ends, and sway bar links wear out prematurely. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front end, uneven tire wear, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn components. It's often recommended to replace parts in pairs (e.g., both tie rod ends or both sway bar links) to ensure even wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (per component/pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Windshield Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The windshield wiper motor can fail, causing the wipers to stop working entirely or operate intermittently. This can be a safety hazard, especially in inclement weather.
    *   Solution: Replacing the wiper motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Faulty TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls many of the vehicle's electrical functions. A faulty TIPM can cause a wide range of issues, including the vehicle not starting, the fuel pump not working, the wipers not working, and the horn honking intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rust issues, particularly on the undercarriage, door panels, and around the wheel wells. This is more common in areas where salt is used on the roads during winter.
    *   Solution: Addressing the rust with sanding, priming, and repainting. In severe cases, body panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors are prone to sagging and eventually breaking due to the plastic supports inside.

**Summary**

The 2008 Jeep Compass is plagued by a number of reliability issues, with the CVT transmission being the most significant and costly concern. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption are also prevalent. Electrical problems and suspension wear add to the list of potential headaches. Overall, the 2008 Jeep Compass can be an affordable entry into the SUV market, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, with repair costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars.
