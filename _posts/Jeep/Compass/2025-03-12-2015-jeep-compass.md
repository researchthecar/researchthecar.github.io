The 2015 Jeep Compass is a compact SUV that offers a blend of affordability and off-road capability. Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter inline-4 generating 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options vary depending on the engine and trim, including a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Compass for its fuel efficiency and relatively low price point, while common dislikes include its lackluster acceleration, dated interior, and reported reliability issues.
