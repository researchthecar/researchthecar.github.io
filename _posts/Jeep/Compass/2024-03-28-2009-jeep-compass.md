**Introduction:**
The 2009 Jeep Compass is a compact SUV that offers two engine options: a 2.0L I-4 with 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L I-4 with 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Compass has received praise for its rugged styling, comfortable interior, and off-road capabilities, but it has also been criticized for its lackluster performance and poor fuel economy.

**Engine**
**2.0L I-4**
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to skip and damaging the engine. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, loss of power, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner and the timing chain. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak and a loss of power. Symptoms include a rough idle, hesitation during acceleration, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
**2.4L I-4**
* **No Major Issues Found**

**Transmission**
**5-Speed Manual**
* **Synchronizer Failure:** The synchronizers in the transmission can fail, making it difficult or impossible to shift gears. Symptoms include grinding or crunching noises when shifting gears, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the synchronizers. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
**6-Speed Automatic**
* **Solenoid Failure:** The solenoids in the transmission can fail, preventing the transmission from shifting gears properly. Symptoms include slipping gears, delayed shifting, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the solenoids. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+

**Suspension**
* **Strut Failure:** The struts can fail, causing the vehicle to bounce excessively and making it difficult to control. Symptoms include a rough ride, excessive body roll, and a clunking noise when going over bumps. The solution is to replace the struts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+ per axle
* **Control Arm Bushings Failure:** The control arm bushings can fail, causing the suspension to become loose and unstable. Symptoms include a clunking noise when going over bumps, excessive wheel camber, and a loose steering feel. The solution is to replace the control arm bushings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per side

**Electrical**
* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely due to a parasitic draw. Symptoms include a dead battery after the vehicle has been parked for a period of time. The solution is to identify and eliminate the source of the parasitic draw. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, preventing the battery from charging. Symptoms include a loss of electrical power, a low battery warning light, and a dead battery. The solution is to replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+

**Exterior**
* **Rust:** The body panels can rust prematurely, especially on vehicles that are exposed to salty conditions. Symptoms include visible rust spots, bubbling paint, and holes in the body panels. The solution is to repair or replace the affected body panels. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the extent of the damage
* **Headlight Failure:** The headlights can fail, reducing visibility at night. Symptoms include dim or flickering headlights, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the headlights. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per headlight

**Interior**
* **Power Window Failure:** The power window motors or switches can fail, preventing the windows from opening or closing properly. Symptoms include inoperable windows, slow window operation, and a burning smell. The solution is to replace the failed motor or switch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
* **Heater Core Failure:** The heater core can fail, causing the vehicle to lose heat. Symptoms include a lack of heat from the vents, a coolant leak, and a sweet smell in the cabin. The solution is to replace the heater core. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+

**Summary:**
The 2009 Jeep Compass has a number of potential problems, including engine timing chain tensioner failure, intake manifold gasket failure, transmission solenoid failure, suspension strut failure, electrical battery drain, and exterior rust. The severity of these issues can vary depending on the specific vehicle and the age and mileage, but they can be expensive to repair. Potential owners should be aware of these issues before purchasing a used Compass.
