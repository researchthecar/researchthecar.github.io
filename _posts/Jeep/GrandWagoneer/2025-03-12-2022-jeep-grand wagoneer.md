The 2022 Jeep Grand Wagoneer represents a return to the large, luxurious SUV segment for Jeep. It boasts a spacious interior, upscale materials, and a powerful engine. The 2022 Grand Wagoneer features a 6.4-liter V8 engine producing 471 horsepower and 455 lb-ft of torque. People often praise its comfortable ride, abundant features, and imposing presence. However, some criticisms include its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and its fuel economy. The Grand Wagoneer uses an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.4L V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or tapping noise coming from the engine, particularly when it's warmed up. Some owners describe it as sounding like a lifter tick.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is crucial. In some cases, it may be related to the multi-displacement system (MDS) or the lifters themselves. Repair may involve replacing lifters, pushrods, or other valve train components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels and check for leaks. The PCV valve may need to be replaced to stop the oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (PCV Valve Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8HP75)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Could be due to valve body issues, or low transmission fluid. A software update might resolve it. In some instances, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software update) - $5,000+ (Transmission Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into drive or reverse and the vehicle actually moving.
    *   Solution: Similar to harsh shifting, this could be related to the valve body or low fluid. Perform a software update, fluid flush, or valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software update) - $3,000+ (Valve Body Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Grand Wagoneer utilizes an air suspension system. Issues may include the vehicle not maintaining the correct ride height, compressor failure, or error messages related to the suspension.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the leak or failure. Replace faulty air struts, compressor, or height sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (per component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system can freeze, crash, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. If the problem persists, a software update from the dealer may be required. In more severe cases, the Uconnect module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (System Reset) - $1,500+ (Module Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, or adaptive cruise control sensors, may malfunction.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor and recalibration (if necessary).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains while the car is off, potentially leaving it unable to start.
    * Solution: A parasitic drain can cause this, which happens when components don't shut down properly. Diagnose which module is drawing power when the car is off. This is likely a Body Control Module (BCM) issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain and the module needing replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the sunroof or moonroof, often causing water stains on the headliner.
    *   Solution: Check and clear the sunroof/moonroof drain tubes. If the seals are damaged, they will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (Drain Cleaning) - $500+ (Seal Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Powered Running Board Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic running boards fail to deploy or retract properly.
    *   Solution: Check for obstructions, and lubricate the hinges. Faulty motors or sensors may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Motor Failures**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the heating or air conditioning system, such as blowing hot air when set to cold, or vice versa.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the issue. Could be a faulty blend door actuator, compressor, or refrigerant leak. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,200+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rattling or Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattles or squeaks emanating from various trim pieces or panels inside the cabin.
    *   Solution: Locate the source of the noise and apply felt tape or foam padding to dampen the vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (depending on the complexity of the fix)

**Summary**

The 2022 Jeep Grand Wagoneer can have several issues, ranging from minor electrical glitches to more significant mechanical problems like engine ticking, transmission issues, and air suspension failures. The severity and cost of these issues vary greatly, with some repairs being relatively inexpensive while others could require thousands of dollars. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing or potential problems. The electrical and Uconnect issues appear to be more common nuisances, while engine, transmission, and suspension concerns could lead to more substantial repair costs.
