### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, being a debut model year, exhibits a generally strong reliability profile for its core mechanical components, including the powerful Hurricane I6 and HEMI V8 engines and their associated transmissions. However, as is common with new luxury vehicles, some early adopters have reported minor electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system's software, and occasional issues with the adaptive air suspension system.
