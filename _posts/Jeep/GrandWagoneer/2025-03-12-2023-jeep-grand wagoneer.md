**Engine**

**3.0L Hurricane Twin Turbo I6**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illumination. Can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis using an OBD-II scanner to identify the affected cylinder(s). Replace faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the number of components needing replacement and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent need to add oil between oil changes, blueish smoke from the exhaust. May indicate worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: Perform an oil consumption test to quantify the rate of oil usage. If excessive, may require engine disassembly and repair or replacement of piston rings, valve stem seals, or other internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repairs required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.4L Hemi V8**

*   **"Hemi Tick"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or tapping sound coming from the engine, typically more pronounced at idle. The cause is often debated, with theories including exhaust manifold leaks, rocker arm issues, or lifter issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the source of the tick. Possible solutions range from tightening exhaust manifold bolts to replacing faulty lifters or rocker arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ depending on the cause and the extent of repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation, rough running, or misfires, particularly when the engine switches between 8-cylinder and 4-cylinder mode. Can lead to premature wear of cylinders used in 4-cylinder mode.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the AFM system. Potential fixes include replacing faulty solenoids or disabling the AFM system using aftermarket tuning solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the extent of the damage and the chosen solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8HP75)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears. May be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. If low or contaminated, perform a fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required to identify internal transmission issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+ depending on the cause and the extent of repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into drive or reverse and the vehicle actually moving.
    *   Solution: Begin by checking transmission fluid level and condition. If these are within spec, the issue could be related to valve body issues. Internal damage can lead to a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+ depending on the cause and the extent of repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**
