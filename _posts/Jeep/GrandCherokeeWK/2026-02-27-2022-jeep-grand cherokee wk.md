### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee WK demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its core powertrain components (3.6L V6 and 5.7L V8 engines, and the 8-speed automatic transmission), which have proven robust. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the optional Quadra-Lift air suspension system, where compressor failures and air spring leaks can occur, leading to potentially significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, specifically within the infotainment system (software glitches) and occasional battery drain issues, are also noted but are not universally reported. For buyers opting for the air suspension, it's advisable to factor in potential maintenance. Otherwise, the Grand Cherokee WK offers a dependable platform for daily driving and off-road adventures.
