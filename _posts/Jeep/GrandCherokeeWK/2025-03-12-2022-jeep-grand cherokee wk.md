Okay, here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee WK, organized as requested. The 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee WK is a carryover of the previous generation Grand Cherokee, sold alongside the redesigned 2022 Grand Cherokee (WL). It offers a blend of comfort and off-road capability that owners generally appreciate. Common praises include its spacious interior, towing capacity, and available 4x4 systems. Criticisms often target its fuel economy, especially with the V8 engine, and some dated interior features compared to the newer WL model. The WK generation offers fewer tech options than the new redesigned WL generation. Engine options include a 3.6L Pentastar V6 (295 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque) and a 5.7L Hemi V8 (360 hp, 390 lb-ft of torque), both paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.
