The 2021 Audi SQ7 is a performance SUV that blends luxury with robust power. Primarily equipped with a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, it produces 500 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque. While a diesel engine option might be available in some markets, the U.S. market predominantly features the gasoline V8. The SQ7 is praised for its impressive acceleration, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. However, some owners have noted its high price point, complex technology that can be overwhelming, and the potential for costly repairs. All models are equipped with an eight-speed automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive.
