### Summary Verdict
The 2024 Audi RS e-tron GT demonstrates strong overall technical reliability, particularly in its core electric powertrain components. The dual electric motors and sophisticated transmission system have shown no significant widespread issues. However, potential owners should be aware of possible concerns with the adaptive air suspension, specifically related to air compressor malfunctions or strut leaks, which can be costly to repair. Electrical systems, while generally robust, have seen some reports of infotainment software glitches and occasional premature failure of the 12V auxiliary battery. Interior components like seat actuators can also experience issues. Despite these points, the RS e-tron GT offers a compelling package with a reliability profile that, for a high-performance EV, is commendably solid, especially considering its advanced technology.
