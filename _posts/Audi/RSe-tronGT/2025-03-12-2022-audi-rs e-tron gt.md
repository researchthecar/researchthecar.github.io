The 2022 Audi RS e-tron GT is a high-performance electric vehicle that blends luxury, technology, and exhilarating performance. It boasts a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system producing a combined 590 horsepower (637 hp in Boost mode) and 612 lb-ft of torque. The RS e-tron GT has received praise for its rapid acceleration, stylish design, comfortable interior, and advanced technology features. However, like any vehicle, it's not without its potential drawbacks. Some owners have noted the limited range compared to some other EVs, the firm ride quality (even with the adjustable suspension), and the high price point. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the common issues and complaints associated with the 2022 Audi RS e-tron GT, categorized by major components.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Motor (590 hp / 612 lb-ft)**

*   **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances where the vehicle unexpectedly enters "turtle mode" or experiences a significant reduction in power, even with sufficient battery charge. This can happen during acceleration or while driving at higher speeds. Diagnostic codes often point to issues with the battery management system (BMS) or a fault within one of the electric motors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by an Audi-certified technician is essential to pinpoint the root cause. Possible solutions include software updates to the BMS, replacement of faulty sensors or modules within the battery pack, or, in rare cases, replacement of one of the electric motors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $10,000+ (depending on the cause, battery components are expensive)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Voltage Battery Faults**
    * Description/Symptoms: A few owners have reported experiencing error messages related to the high-voltage battery system. These error messages can indicate a variety of potential problems, ranging from issues with individual battery modules to problems with the battery cooling system. Symptoms can include a reduced range, slower charging speeds, or complete failure of the vehicle to start.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified Audi technician is required. Depending on the nature of the fault, the resolution may involve replacing individual battery modules, repairing the battery cooling system, or, in some cases, replacing the entire high-voltage battery pack.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $20,000+ (Battery replacement is very expensive)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adaptive air suspension, while contributing to the car's ride quality and handling, has been a source of occasional complaints. Symptoms include the vehicle not maintaining the correct ride height, uneven ride height between corners, or error messages related to the suspension system. Faulty air struts, compressors, or sensors are the most common causes.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify the faulty component (air strut, compressor, height sensor, etc.). Replacement of the defective part and recalibration of the suspension system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (per strut, compressor replacement is often more expensive)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) infotainment system can be prone to freezing, lagging, or crashing. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often the first step. If the problem persists, a system reset or replacement of the MMI control unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (control unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the charging system, including the car not charging at the expected rate or failing to charge altogether. This can be due to problems with the charging port, onboard charger, or the external charging equipment.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician to identify the faulty component. Possible solutions include replacing the charging port, onboard charger, or repairing the wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Lane Keep Assist, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sensors used for parking assist, lane keep assist, and other driver-assistance features may malfunction due to weather, debris, or sensor failure. This can result in error messages, disabled features, or erratic behavior.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the affected sensor. Recalibration of the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per sensor, recalibration may add to the cost)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Motor Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the electric seat motors, leading to difficulty adjusting the seat position. Can affect fore/aft movement, recline, or lumbar support.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty seat motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per motor)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof or moonroof malfunctions, including issues with opening/closing, unusual noises, or leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific problem (motor, track, seals). Repair or replacement of the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Audi RS e-tron GT, while a desirable high-performance EV, is subject to some common issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the infotainment system and charging, appear to be relatively frequent. Suspension malfunctions, while less common, can be expensive to address due to the complexity of the air suspension system. High voltage battery issues have the potential to be very expensive depending on the resolution. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and ensure that any used vehicle undergoes a thorough inspection by a qualified Audi technician before purchase. The severity and cost of these potential issues vary widely, from minor software glitches to major component failures, and can significantly impact the ownership experience.
