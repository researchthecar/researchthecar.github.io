The 2014 Audi TTS is a sporty, high-performance variant of the Audi TT coupe. It comes equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 265 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with a 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission and features Audi's quattro all-wheel drive system. Owners often praise the TTS for its sharp handling, quick acceleration, and stylish design. However, some common complaints include a firm ride, limited rear seat space, and potentially costly maintenance.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (EA113)**

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, reduced acceleration, possible engine misfires, and a check engine light. The diverter valve (also known as a bypass valve) is responsible for recirculating excess boost pressure back into the intake system when the throttle is closed. Diaphragm tears or valve sticking can cause failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the diverter valve. Upgraded aftermarket valves are available for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, reduced power, and a check engine light. The ignition coils provide the spark to ignite the air/fuel mixture in each cylinder.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil(s). It is often recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Follower Wear (High-Pressure Fuel Pump)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, rough idling, loss of power, and a check engine light. The cam follower is a small part that sits between the fuel pump and the camshaft. It can wear down over time due to friction.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam follower. Regular inspection and preventative replacement can prevent more serious damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, reduced fuel economy, and a check engine light. Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over them to keep them clean.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves by media blasting or walnut blasting. Chemical cleaning methods can also be used, but may not be as effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifting, delayed engagement, inability to select gears, transmission malfunction warning light. The mechatronic unit is the transmission control unit (TCU) and hydraulic control unit combined into one unit.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the mechatronic unit. In some cases, reprogramming the TCU may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Pack Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, shuddering during gear changes, difficulty engaging gears, and transmission malfunction warning light. The dual-clutch transmission relies on two clutches to engage and disengage gears quickly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch packs. The transmission may need to be removed from the vehicle for this repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Dampers Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking fluid from the dampers, uneven ride height, reduced handling performance, and a warning light. The magnetic ride suspension uses dampers filled with magnetorheological fluid, which allows the damping force to be adjusted electronically.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixelation/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Missing or faded pixels on the instrument cluster display, flickering display, or complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, navigation errors, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and screen malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Software update, replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Audi TTS, while a fun and capable sports car, has some potential issues to be aware of. Engine issues such as diverter valve failure, ignition coil failure, carbon buildup, and cam follower wear can lead to performance problems and costly repairs. The S tronic transmission can also be prone to mechatronic unit failure or clutch pack wear, which can also be quite expensive. Suspension issues and electrical problems, such as magnetic ride damper failure or instrument cluster pixelation, are other potential concerns. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others can cost several thousand dollars. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
