### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Audi TTS presents a generally strong reliability profile, especially for a performance-oriented vehicle. The primary areas that may require attention are the engine's PCV system and potential oil consumption, which can be costly to repair if severe. The S tronic transmission, while excellent for performance, has had reports of mechatronic unit and clutch pack issues, which are also significant expenses. The optional Magnetic Ride Control suspension can be a source of repair costs if dampers fail. However, for the standard chassis and most electrical, exterior, and interior components, the TTS is considered reliable with no widespread recurring problems. Regular maintenance is key to mitigating potential issues.
