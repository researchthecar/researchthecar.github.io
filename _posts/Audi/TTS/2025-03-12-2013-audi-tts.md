The 2013 Audi TTS is a high-performance coupe and roadster offering a blend of style and sporty driving dynamics. It features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 265 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered through a standard 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. There is no other engine option. People appreciate the TTS for its engaging driving experience, nimble handling, and distinctive design. Common dislikes often revolve around its firm ride, limited rear seat space (in the coupe), and potentially higher maintenance costs compared to more mainstream vehicles.

**Summary:**

The 2013 Audi TTS can be a fun and rewarding car to own, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems, particularly timing chain tensioner failure, and transmission issues with the S tronic are the most concerning due to their potential severity and high repair costs. Magnetic Ride Control, if equipped, can also lead to expensive repairs. Electrical issues are common, although typically less expensive to resolve. Overall, pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended, and budgeting for potential repairs is advisable.
