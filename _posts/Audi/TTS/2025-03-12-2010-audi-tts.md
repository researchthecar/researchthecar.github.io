The 2010 Audi TTS is a sporty coupe or roadster offering a blend of performance and style. The TTS is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 265 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The TTS came standard with a six-speed manual transmission and was available with a six-speed dual-clutch S tronic transmission. Owners appreciate the TTS for its nimble handling, distinctive styling, and luxurious interior. Some common dislikes include the firm ride, limited rear seat space (in the coupe), and the potential for costly repairs as the car ages.

**Summary**

The 2010 Audi TTS offers a fun driving experience but is not without its potential issues. Engine problems like camshaft follower and diverter valve failures, while relatively inexpensive to fix preventatively, can cause more damage if left unaddressed. The S tronic transmission can be a source of costly repairs, particularly the mechatronic unit. Suspension components, especially the magnetic ride control, can also be expensive to replace. Electrical and interior issues, while less frequent, can still be a nuisance. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in maintenance and repair costs when considering a 2010 Audi TTS.
