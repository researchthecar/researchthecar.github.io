### Summary Verdict

Minor engine concerns like PCV valve failures and water pump leaks are not uncommon for this era of Audi but are typically manageable. Overall, with proper maintenance, the 2014 TTS should provide an enjoyable and relatively dependable ownership experience, with the transmission being the primary area to monitor for potential higher-cost repairs.
