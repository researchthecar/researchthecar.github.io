The 2012 Audi TTS is a sporty coupe and convertible, offering enhanced performance over the standard TT. Its appeal lies in its stylish design, sharp handling, and potent turbocharged engine. However, like any vehicle, it's not without its potential issues. Some owners appreciate the car's nimble feel and distinctive looks, while others are critical of its limited rear seat space and potentially higher maintenance costs. The 2012 Audi TTS came with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 265 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. The standard Audi TT came with a less powerful version of the same engine.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (265 hp)**

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HPFP can fail, leading to rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, and potentially a complete stall. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel pressure regulation may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump. It's often recommended to replace the cam follower as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, leading to reduced power and acceleration. A hissing or fluttering sound might be audible during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the diverter valve with an updated version (revision D or later is often recommended).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2012 Audi TTS can be a rewarding car to own, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems like HPFP and timing chain tensioner failures can be costly to repair. The S-Tronic transmission is another potential weak point, with the mechatronic unit being a known source of problems. While not every TTS will experience these issues, it's wise to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with Audis. The severity and cost of these potential issues range from relatively minor (diverter valve) to significant (engine or transmission overhaul), so budgeting for maintenance and repairs is essential.
