The 2012 Audi TTS is a compelling sports coupe with a generally solid reliability record. The 2.0L TFSI engine, while powerful, has a few known potential issues such as PCV valve failure, water pump leaks, and turbocharger concerns, which can be costly to repair. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission, while offering quick shifts, is more prone to issues like mechatronic unit failure and clutch wear compared to the manual gearbox, which is typically more robust.
