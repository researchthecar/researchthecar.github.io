### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Audi TTS is a capable performance car with a generally solid reliability record. The 2.0L turbocharged engine is robust, though common issues like PCV valve failures and water pump leaks can occur. The S tronic transmission, while offering quick shifts, can be susceptible to mechatronic unit or clutch pack issues, which can be costly to repair. The manual transmission is more straightforward but clutch wear is a consideration with spirited driving. Optional Magnetic Ride Control dampers can fail, impacting ride quality. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are not uncommon. Overall, the TTS offers a compelling blend of performance and style, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific maintenance needs and potential repair costs associated with its performance components.
