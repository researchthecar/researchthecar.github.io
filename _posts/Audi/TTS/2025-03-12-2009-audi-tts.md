Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2009 Audi TTS, formatted for your website and following your specified guidelines.

The 2009 Audi TTS is a sporty, turbocharged coupe and roadster known for its stylish design and engaging driving dynamics. This model year features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine that produces 265 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. It's offered with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed S-tronic dual-clutch transmission. Many owners appreciate the TTS's nimble handling, distinctive looks, and comfortable interior. Some common dislikes include the relatively small rear seats (in the coupe), limited cargo space, and the potential for expensive repairs, particularly related to the complex turbocharged engine and dual-clutch transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (TFSI)**

*   **Cam Follower Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cam follower, which sits between the camshaft and the high-pressure fuel pump, is prone to wear and eventual failure. Symptoms include a ticking noise from the engine, rough running, reduced power, and potentially a check engine light. If left unattended, the worn follower can damage the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam follower is the standard fix. It's often recommended to replace the follower preventatively at regular intervals (e.g., every 30,000-50,000 miles) to avoid more serious damage. If the camshaft is damaged, it will need to be replaced as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (cam follower replacement only). Camshaft replacement can significantly increase the cost.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The diverter valve, also known as a bypass valve, recirculates excess boost pressure back into the intake system. A torn or damaged diverter valve can cause a loss of boost pressure, resulting in reduced power, hesitation during acceleration, and a possible check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty diverter valve. Upgraded aftermarket diverter valves are often recommended for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger itself can experience issues such as wastegate failure, oil leaks, or internal damage. Symptoms may include reduced power, whistling noises, excessive oil consumption, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity of the issue, the turbocharger may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed S-tronic (DSG) Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit is the electro-hydraulic control unit for the DSG transmission. Failure of the mechatronic unit can cause a range of issues, including harsh shifting, delayed engagement, complete loss of gear selection, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: The mechatronic unit typically needs to be replaced or rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Pack Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DSG transmission uses multiple clutch packs to engage and disengage different gears. Over time, these clutch packs can wear out, leading to slipping, jerky shifting, and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn clutch packs is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1800 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (If Equipped) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TTS's optional Magnetic Ride Control system uses magnetic fluid dampers to adjust suspension damping in real-time. Issues can include damper leaks, failure of the magnetic ride sensors, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Damaged dampers and sensors need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per damper.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Convenience Control Module Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This module controls various functions, including power windows, door locks, interior lighting, and alarm system. Problems can manifest as intermittent or complete failure of these functions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the module. Programming may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Spoiler Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The retractable rear spoiler might fail to deploy or retract properly, potentially due to a faulty motor or mechanism.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the spoiler motor or mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory navigation and infotainment system can experience issues such as screen malfunctions, software glitches, and speaker problems.
    *   Solution: Depending on the nature of the problem, repairs may involve software updates, component replacement, or complete unit replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Audi TTS offers a compelling blend of style and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine problems like cam follower wear and diverter valve failure are relatively common and can lead to more serious damage if not addressed promptly. The S-tronic transmission, while providing quick and smooth shifts, can be prone to expensive mechatronic unit and clutch pack failures. Suspension issues, particularly with the optional Magnetic Ride Control, can also add to the cost of ownership. Overall, while the TTS is a fun car to drive, it's important to budget for potential repairs and maintenance to ensure a reliable and enjoyable ownership experience. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and the cost to fix them can vary widely, potentially reaching several thousand dollars for major repairs. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
