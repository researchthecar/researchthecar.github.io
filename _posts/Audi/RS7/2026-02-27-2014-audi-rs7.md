### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Audi RS7 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, with a generally robust mechanical foundation. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to its high-performance components, such as the twin-turbo V8 engine's PCV system and turbochargers, and the sophisticated eight-speed automatic transmission's mechatronic unit. The adaptive air suspension, while providing excellent ride comfort and adjustability, can be a source of costly repairs if leaks or compressor failures occur. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the MMI infotainment system, are also noted. Despite these potential issues, many owners report high satisfaction, provided regular and specialized maintenance is performed. Proactive inspection of these known weak points can help mitigate unexpected repair costs.
