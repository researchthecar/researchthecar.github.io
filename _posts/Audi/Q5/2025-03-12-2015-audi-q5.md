The 2015 Audi Q5 is a luxury compact SUV that offers a blend of performance, comfort, and style. For the 2015 model year, the Q5 was available with three engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (220 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L supercharged V6 (272 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L TDI turbo diesel V6 (240 hp and 428 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Q5 for its luxurious interior, comfortable ride, and available Quattro all-wheel drive. Common complaints revolve around higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles, and some specific reliability concerns that can arise with age.
