The 2022 Audi Q5 is a popular compact luxury SUV known for its refined interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 261 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. A plug-in hybrid version is also available, combining the 2.0-liter turbo engine with an electric motor, delivering a combined 362 horsepower. All Q5 models come standard with a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. Owners appreciate the Q5's upscale cabin, smooth power delivery, and quietness. Some common complaints revolve around the sometimes-hesitant transmission behavior at low speeds and the high cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (261 hp, 273 lb-ft)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled services. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can help manage oil consumption. More severe cases might require replacing piston rings or other internal engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty. Replacing piston rings can cost $2,000 - $4,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are reported by some owners, often caused by a failing water pump or leaky hoses. Symptoms include a sweet smell, low coolant levels, and overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the water pump and/or hoses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500

**Summary**

The 2022 Audi Q5, while generally reliable, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The 2.0L turbo engine can exhibit oil consumption and coolant leaks, while the hybrid version faces potential battery problems. The dual-clutch transmission can have low-speed hesitation, and electrical issues involving the infotainment system and sensors are also reported. Suspension and interior rattles can also occur. While many of these issues can be addressed under warranty, out-of-warranty repairs can be costly, especially for complex components like the Mechatronic unit or hybrid battery. Overall, the severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be diligent in performing pre-purchase inspections and consider the cost of ownership, including potential repairs.
