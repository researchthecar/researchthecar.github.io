Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2009 Audi Q5, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options.

The 2009 Audi Q5 marked the debut of Audi's compact luxury crossover SUV. This year's model offered a blend of practicality and luxury, attracting buyers with its stylish design, comfortable interior, and available quattro all-wheel drive.  The 2009 Q5 was available with two engine options: a 3.2L V6 producing 265 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 generating 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, both paired with a 6-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Q5's refined ride, upscale interior, and responsive handling. Some common dislikes include the relatively small cargo area compared to some competitors, and the potential for costly repairs as the vehicle ages.

**Summary**

The 2009 Audi Q5, while generally a well-regarded vehicle, is prone to certain issues as it ages. Engine-related problems, particularly oil consumption in the 2.0L turbo and timing chain issues in the 3.2L V6, can be significant and costly. Transmission problems, valve body issues, and torque converter failure can also add to the expense. Suspension and electrical issues, while less severe, can also contribute to the overall cost of ownership. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering purchasing a used 2009 Audi Q5.
