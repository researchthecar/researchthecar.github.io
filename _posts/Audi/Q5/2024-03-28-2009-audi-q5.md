**Introduction**

The 2009 Audi Q5 is a compact luxury crossover SUV that offers a combination of performance, practicality, and comfort. It is powered by a choice of two engines: a 2.0-liter TFSI inline-four producing 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, or a 3.2-liter FSI V6 generating 270 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission.

Drivers appreciate the Q5's responsive handling, powerful engines, and spacious interior. However, it has received some criticism for its relatively high price and optional features that come at an extra cost.
