Electrical components, especially the MMI system and power tailgate, can present intermittent glitches. Suspension components like control arm bushings may require attention as mileage increases. Overall, while not immune to problems, the Q5 offers a premium experience, but potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
