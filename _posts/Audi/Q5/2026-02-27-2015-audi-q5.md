### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi Q5 generally offers a solid ownership experience with a few notable areas of concern. The 2.0L TFSI engine has documented issues with oil consumption and timing chain wear, which can be costly to repair. The 3.0L TFSI V6 is more robust but can suffer from PCV valve and supercharger belt problems. Transmission issues, particularly with the mechatronic unit and torque converter on the automatic, are also reported. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MMI infotainment system and parking sensors, can be frustrating. Finally, the panoramic sunroof's drain tubes are prone to clogging, potentially causing water ingress. Despite these points, many Q5s perform reliably with proper maintenance, but potential buyers should be aware of these common technical challenges.
