The 2011 Audi Q5 is a popular compact luxury SUV known for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving dynamics. It offered two primary engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L V6 generating 270 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Q5's upscale cabin, composed handling, and available Quattro all-wheel drive. However, some criticisms include higher maintenance costs and a less spacious cargo area compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners report excessive oil consumption, sometimes requiring as much as a quart every 1,000 miles or less. This often manifests as the low oil pressure light illuminating, or the engine running rough.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to replace the piston rings. Some owners have opted for a full engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A faulty timing chain tensioner can cause the timing chain to skip, leading to serious engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise upon startup, especially in cold weather, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and potentially other related components. There is an updated design that should be used to prevent future failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 3.2L V6 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, leading to reduced performance, rough idling, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: A carbon cleaning service, involving walnut blasting or chemical cleaning of the intake valves, is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the valve body, leading to harsh or delayed shifting, slipping, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve body or, in more severe cases, a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and failure of the control arm bushings can cause clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can also affect handling and alignment.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arms or just the bushings (if possible).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning Sunroof**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof can sometimes malfunction, failing to open or close properly, or getting stuck in an intermediate position.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, switch, or track components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window regulators may fail, causing windows to become inoperable or move erratically.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks (Sunroof/Tail Lights)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the sunroof seals or tail light housings, leading to moisture in the cabin or trunk.
    * Solution: Replacement of the sunroof seals or tail light gaskets, and addressing any rust or corrosion in the affected areas.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation or infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure.
    * Solution: Software updates, or replacement of the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Audi Q5 can be a great choice for a luxury SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly those related to the 2.0L engine's oil consumption and timing chain tensioner. Carbon buildup on the V6 engine, and potential transmission valve body issues are also important considerations. Suspension wear and electrical problems can also surface. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but engine repairs, in particular, can be quite expensive. Therefore, a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
