The Q5 has received praise for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and responsive handling. However, some owners have reported issues with certain components.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

* **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves:** Carbon deposits can accumulate on the intake valves, leading to reduced engine performance and fuel economy. The solution involves cleaning the valves, which can cost around $500 - $1,000.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner may fail, causing a rattling noise and potentially leading to engine damage. Replacement of the tensioner and related components can cost around $2,000 - $3,000.
