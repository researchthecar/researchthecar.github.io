The 2021 Audi Q5 is a popular luxury compact SUV known for its refined interior, comfortable ride, and responsive handling. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 261 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. A plug-in hybrid version is also available, combining the 2.0-liter engine with an electric motor for a combined output of 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both powertrains are paired with a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Q5's upscale cabin, user-friendly technology, and overall driving experience. Common criticisms include the relatively small cargo area and the sometimes-hesitant behavior of the dual-clutch transmission at low speeds.
