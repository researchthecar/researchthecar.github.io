The 2014 Audi Q5 is a compact luxury SUV offering a blend of performance, practicality, and upscale features. Engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 generating 272 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are either an 8-speed automatic paired with the 2.0T engine or the 3.0T engine. Owners generally appreciate the Q5's comfortable ride, stylish interior, and available technology. Common criticisms include a somewhat firm suspension, a dated infotainment system, and potential for expensive repairs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (2.0T)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.0T engine in certain 2014 Q5s is known for consuming an excessive amount of oil, sometimes requiring owners to add oil frequently between service intervals. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Audi issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) regarding this issue. A common fix involves replacing the piston rings and pistons to improve oil sealing. A software update can also be performed to adjust the oil level sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (piston ring/piston replacement). Oil consumption tests can cost $100-$200.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can fail, potentially leading to timing chain slippage and significant engine damage. Symptoms may include rattling noises at startup, a check engine light, and rough engine running.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, timing chain, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Supercharged V6 (3.0T)**

*   **Supercharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger may fail, leading to a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or rattling), and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are a common issue, often stemming from the water pump or thermostat housing. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty component (water pump, thermostat housing, or related seals).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both 2.0T and 3.0T)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough shifting, hesitation, or delays when shifting gears. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update may resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 (fluid flush/software update); $1,500 - $3,000+ (valve body); $4,000 - $7,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the control arm bushings can lead to clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. It can also negatively affect handling and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system can experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve some issues. A faulty MMI control unit may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (software update); $800 - $2,000+ (MMI control unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working or operate erratically due to a faulty window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Panoramic Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks can occur around the panoramic sunroof, often due to clogged drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Clean and clear the sunroof drain tubes. Check the sunroof seal.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning may stop blowing cold air or blow inconsistently due to a refrigerant leak, compressor failure, or a faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the A/C system to identify the source of the problem (leak, compressor, actuator). Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+, depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Audi Q5 presents a mix of positive attributes and potential concerns. The 2.0T engine's oil consumption issue and the 3.0T's supercharger problems can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension and electrical issues are also common, potentially impacting ride quality and vehicle functionality. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, with associated repair costs varying accordingly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and consider a pre-purchase inspection to assess the vehicle's condition.
