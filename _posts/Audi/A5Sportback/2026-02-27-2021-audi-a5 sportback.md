### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Audi A5 Sportback demonstrates good overall reliability, with the powertrain and core mechanicals generally performing well. The most frequently cited technical concerns revolve around potential oil consumption in the 2.0L TFSI engines and occasional software glitches within the infotainment system. The dual-clutch S tronic transmission can sometimes exhibit less-than-smooth shifting. However, these issues are often addressable through software updates or component servicing and do not indicate systemic failures across the model range. Suspension, electrical components (outside of infotainment), exterior, and interior elements show a high degree of reliability with no widespread reported problems. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any early signs of the noted issues are recommended for optimal long-term ownership.
