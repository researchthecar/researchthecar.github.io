The 2024 Audi A5 Sportback is a stylish and practical luxury vehicle known for its sleek design, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. It's a popular choice for drivers who want a sporty driving experience with the added versatility of a hatchback. The base engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 201 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, while an upgraded version of the same engine generates 261 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission and quattro all-wheel drive. Owners often praise the A5 Sportback's attractive styling, well-appointed interior, and nimble handling. Some common complaints include the sometimes-firm ride, the infotainment system's learning curve, and the limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline.
