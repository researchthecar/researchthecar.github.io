The 2019 Audi A5 Sportback is a sleek and stylish four-door hatchback known for its sporty handling and upscale interior. The most common engine is the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, producing 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include the S5's 3.0-liter turbocharged V6. Both are paired with either a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission or an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission depending on the model. Owners generally praise the A5 Sportback for its elegant design, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. Common dislikes include the relatively small rear seat space and the complexity of the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Some will notice white or blue smoke from the tailpipes.
    *   Solution: Addressing excessive oil consumption can involve several steps. Initially, a compression test is performed to gauge engine health. If the compression is deemed adequate, the next step often involves replacing the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) valve, which helps regulate pressure within the engine. However, if these measures don't solve the problem, the issue might be more severe, necessitating the replacement of the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for the PCV valve, $2000 - $5000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S-Tronic Dual-Clutch Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting, especially at lower speeds, and hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis often begins with a software update to the transmission control module (TCM). If the problem persists, inspection of the Mechatronic unit is warranted, as internal failures can lead to shifting irregularities. In severe cases, complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software update, $1500 - $3000+ for Mechatronic unit repair or replacement, $5000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the MMI control unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software update, $800 - $1500+ for MMI control unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the vehicle's many sensors, including parking sensors and driver-assist systems like lane departure warning. These sensors might provide false alerts or stop working entirely.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis typically involves scanning the vehicle's computer for error codes to pinpoint the faulty sensor. Replacement of the defective sensor is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on the type and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the sunroof, including difficulty opening or closing, unusual noises, or leaks.
    *   Solution: This can involve cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks, replacing the sunroof motor, or repairing the seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Adaptive Headlight Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adaptive headlights, which turn with the steering wheel, can sometimes malfunction, leading to error messages on the dashboard or incorrect headlight positioning.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis usually involves checking the headlight control module and the individual headlight motors. Replacement of faulty components is the most common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+, depending on the affected component.
    *   Recalls: None Found
