The 2021 Audi RS Q3 is a performance-oriented subcompact SUV that boasts a potent 2.5-liter turbocharged five-cylinder engine, making it a standout in its class. This engine delivers around 400 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the RS Q3 for its exhilarating acceleration, sporty handling, and distinctive styling. However, some common complaints include a firm ride, limited cargo space compared to more conventional SUVs, and the higher running costs associated with a performance vehicle.

**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Inline-5**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between scheduled services. This can manifest as low oil level warnings on the dashboard or noticing a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. A dealer inspection might be necessary to determine the cause, ranging from minor leaks to internal engine issues. Potential fixes include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (minor leak) - $8,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises, reduced power, and potential boost leaks. This could indicate a failing turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic to check for boost leaks, damaged turbocharger components, or issues with the wastegate. Replacement of the turbocharger may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like hesitation or a noticeable lurch between gears.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, replacement of the mechatronic unit (the valve body assembly) or the clutch pack may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update) - $4,000+ (Mechatronic unit/Clutch pack)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Stiff Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the RS Q3's sport-tuned suspension, the ride can be firm, especially on rough road surfaces. This is often noted as a general characteristic of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: There is no easy fix for this beyond the factory suspension. Aftermarket options may be available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI infotainment system can sometimes experience glitches, such as freezing, slow response times, or connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the system. If the problem persists, a software update from the dealer might be needed. In rare cases, hardware replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Reset) - $1,500+ (Hardware Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues can arise with various sensors, such as parking sensors, tire pressure monitoring sensors (TPMS), or the rain sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with an OBDII scanner to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the affected sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported interior rattling or buzzing noises, often emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear hatch area. These noises can be exacerbated by rough road surfaces.
    * Solution: Pinpointing the source of the rattle and securing the loose components. This might involve adding felt tape, tightening screws, or replacing clips.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$500+ depending on complexity
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Audi RS Q3, while lauded for its performance and styling, does have some potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The engine, particularly the 2.5L turbocharged inline-5, may exhibit excessive oil consumption or turbocharger problems, potentially leading to significant repair costs. The S tronic transmission can also experience rough shifting. Electrical issues, such as infotainment glitches and sensor malfunctions, can also occur. While the severity and frequency of these issues vary, being informed can help buyers make a more confident decision and be prepared for potential maintenance costs.
