### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Audi RS Q3 demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly concerning its core mechanical components like the engine and transmission when properly maintained. However, potential owners should be aware of specific issues that have been noted. The potent 2.5L turbocharged engine, while powerful, can be susceptible to coolant leaks and, less commonly, turbocharger problems. The 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission, a performance-oriented unit, may experience issues with its mechatronics unit or clutch packs over time. Electrical gremlins, primarily manifesting as infotainment system glitches or intermittent battery drain, are also areas to monitor. While suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread defects, proactive maintenance and prompt attention to any emerging symptoms are crucial for ensuring long-term satisfaction with this performance-oriented SUV.
