The 2011 Audi S3 is a performance-oriented hatchback that delivers a sporty driving experience. In the US Market, it came equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 265 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual transmission was the only transmission option available. Owners generally appreciate the S3's agile handling, strong engine performance, and upscale interior. However, some common criticisms include the relatively firm ride and potential for costly repairs. The issues outlined below are based on commonly reported problems and should not be taken as an indication that every 2011 S3 will experience all of them.

**Engine**

**2.0L TFSI (EA113)**

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, decreased acceleration, and potential error codes related to turbocharger underboost. The diaphragm within the diverter valve can crack or tear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the diverter valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

*   **Cam Follower Wear (High-Pressure Fuel Pump)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise from the top of the engine, especially at idle. This is caused by the cam follower, which sits between the camshaft and the high-pressure fuel pump, wearing down. If left unaddressed, it can lead to damage to the camshaft itself.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam follower. If the camshaft is damaged, it will also need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (cam follower only), $500 - $1500+ (cam follower and camshaft)

*   **Timing Belt Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, loud noises from the engine bay, or complete engine failure. Failure of the timing belt tensioner can cause the timing belt to skip, leading to valve damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing belt, tensioner, and potentially other components like the water pump. In severe cases, engine repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, hesitation upon acceleration, and potential error codes related to misfires. Direct injection engines, like the 2.0T, are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over them to clean them.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (e.g., walnut blasting) or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs up without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, particularly during acceleration in higher gears. This is due to wear of the clutch friction disc.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. It is often recommended to also resurface the flywheel or replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+

*   **Throwout Bearing Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or squealing noise when the clutch pedal is depressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the throwout bearing. This typically requires removing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, increased body roll, and potential leaks from the shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected shock absorbers/dampers. Replacing them in pairs (both front or both rear) is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ (per pair)

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Imprecise steering and wandering at highway speeds can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per control arm)

**Electrical**

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, decreased fuel economy, and potential error codes related to misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (per coil)

*   **ABS Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS warning light illumination, loss of ABS functionality, and potential error codes related to the ABS system.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the ABS module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Microswitch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door handle microswitch can fail, preventing the car from sensing that the door is being opened. This can cause issues with keyless entry, alarm, and interior lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door handle with integrated microswitch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaches from the backing board and begins to sag. This is more common in hotter climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement or re-upholstering of the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Summary**

The 2011 Audi S3 offers a compelling blend of performance and practicality, but potential owners should be aware of the common issues it can face. Engine issues like carbon buildup and diverter valve failure, along with transmission concerns like clutch wear, are relatively common and can lead to moderate to high repair costs. Suspension and electrical problems can also arise, contributing to the overall cost of ownership. While not all S3s will experience these problems, a thorough inspection and preventative maintenance are crucial for ensuring its reliability and longevity.
