The 2019 Audi S3 is a compact performance sedan known for its blend of luxury, sporty handling, and everyday usability. The S3 offered a single engine option: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 288 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. It was exclusively paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners often praise the S3 for its quick acceleration, precise steering, and upscale interior. Criticisms sometimes include a firm ride (especially with the optional sport suspension), and some find the infotainment system a bit complex.

**Summary**

The 2019 Audi S3, while a fun and capable car, can present some potential reliability concerns. The most significant issues tend to revolve around the engine, specifically water pump and turbocharger failures, and the transmission, with potential for Mechatronic unit issues and clutch slippage in the S tronic dual-clutch. Suspension problems are common on models with the magnetic ride system. Electrical glitches in the infotainment system are also reported. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars depending on the component involved. It's important to consider these potential issues when evaluating a used 2019 Audi S3 and factor in the cost of preventative maintenance.
