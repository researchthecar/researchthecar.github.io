### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Audi S3, while a desirable performance car, exhibits some common issues typical for its age and performance focus. The 1.8T engine can be robust but requires attention to its PCV system and turbocharger longevity. Transmission reliability, particularly with the DSG, can be a significant expense if issues arise. Suspension components like bushings and shocks are wear items that will likely need replacement on higher mileage examples. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and ABS sensors, are also noted. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and prompt repair of known issues, the 2003 S3 can remain a rewarding and engaging vehicle.
