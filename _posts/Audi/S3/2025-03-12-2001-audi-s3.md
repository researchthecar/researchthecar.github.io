The 2001 Audi S3 (8L chassis) is a sporty compact hatchback known for its performance and quattro all-wheel-drive system. It primarily came with a turbocharged 1.8-liter inline-four engine (1.8T) available in various states of tune, producing around 210 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque in its initial iteration for the 2001 model year. The engine was exclusively paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the S3's handling, performance, and timeless styling. Common complaints include the age-related reliability issues typical of older European cars, especially with vacuum lines, sensors, and electrical components, as well as the cost of maintaining a performance-oriented vehicle.
