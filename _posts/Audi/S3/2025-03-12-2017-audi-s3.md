The 2017 Audi S3 is a performance-oriented compact sedan, known for its agile handling, quick acceleration, and refined interior. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 292 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. It came standard with the 7-speed S-Tronic dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the S3 for its fun-to-drive nature and upscale features, but some common complaints include infotainment system glitches, potential for costly repairs, and a firm ride quality.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (EA888)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the EA888 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing the valves as with port injection. This leads to rough idling, decreased performance, misfires, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) or chemical cleaning. Installation of an oil catch can may help slow down the buildup process.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ depending on the method and shop labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, overheating, and low coolant level.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump, thermostat, and related seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual noises from the turbocharger (whining or screeching), check engine light.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement or rebuild. Diagnosis of the underlying cause (oil starvation, etc.) is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S-Tronic Dual-Clutch (DQ381)**

    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the Mechatronic unit. Sometimes, reprogramming the unit can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, jerky engagement, difficulty shifting smoothly, shuddering.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride quality, error messages related to the adaptive damping system, clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty damper(s), checking wiring and control modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates or replacement of the MMI unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update) - $1500+ (if unit replacement)
