### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Audi S3 is a capable performance vehicle, but its age and performance-oriented nature mean certain components are prone to wear and failure. The 1.8T engine can suffer from PCV issues, turbo problems, and ignition coil failures. Transmissions, particularly the manual, may require clutch replacements or attention to gear linkage.
