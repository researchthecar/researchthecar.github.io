The 2015 Audi S3 is a performance-oriented compact sedan, offering a blend of luxury, sporty handling, and practicality. The standard engine option for the 2015 Audi S3 is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (EA888) producing 292 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque.

Some common criticisms include a firm ride and somewhat limited rear seat space.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (EA888)**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, overheating, low coolant warning light. The plastic water pump impeller can crack or disintegrate, leading to a loss of coolant circulation.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump with an updated version (often with a metal impeller) and thermostat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, decreased performance, poor fuel economy. Direct injection engines like the EA888 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves as there is no fuel washing over the valves to clean them.
    *   Solution: Manually clean the intake valves by walnut blasting or using a chemical cleaner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whistling noise from the engine, rough idle, oil leaks, and potentially a check engine light. The PCV valve regulates pressure in the crankcase, and a failure can lead to various issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the PCV valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, transmission slipping, inability to shift gears, error messages on the dash. The mechatronic unit is the electronic control unit for the transmission and can fail due to heat and wear.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the mechatronic unit. In some cases, a software update may temporarily alleviate the issue, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **MagRide (Magnetic Ride Control) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride quality, knocking noises from the suspension, error messages related to suspension control. The magnetic dampers can leak fluid or fail internally.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected magnetic dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per damper (depending on location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: System freezes, screen goes black, Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation issues. The infotainment system can be prone to glitches and software issues.
    *   Solution: Software update, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattles/Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or creaking noises from the sunroof area, especially when driving over uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the sunroof tracks and seals, tighten any loose components, or replace worn sunroof components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks (Tail Lights)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water can collect inside the taillights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the seals and potentially the entire taillight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Audi S3, while a fun and capable vehicle, has its share of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the water pump and carbon buildup, are relatively common and can be costly to address. The S tronic transmission can also experience significant failures with the mechatronic unit. Suspension issues, especially with the MagRide system, can also lead to expensive repairs. Electrical glitches and interior noises are less severe but still noteworthy. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs and carefully inspect any used 2015 Audi S3 before purchasing.
