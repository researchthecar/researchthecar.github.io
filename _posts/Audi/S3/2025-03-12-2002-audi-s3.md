The 2002 Audi S3 (8L Chassis) is a sporty, turbocharged hot hatch known for its quattro all-wheel-drive system and nimble handling. In 2002, the S3 was primarily equipped with a 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine (different variations, mostly the BAM engine code) producing around 225 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed manual transmission was the only transmission option. Owners generally appreciate the S3's performance, compact size, and distinctive styling. Common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs, the age of the vehicle leading to increased component failures, and the complexity of the turbocharged engine.
