### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Audi S3, while a capable performance car, exhibits some common issues associated with its turbocharged engine and performance-oriented drivetrain. The 1.8T engine can suffer from PCV system failures, ignition coil issues, and potential turbocharger wear. Transmissions, particularly the DSG, can be costly to repair if the mechatronics unit or clutch packs fail. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks are also wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or window regulators, can also occur. Despite these potential drawbacks, regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate major repair costs and ensure the continued enjoyment of this sporty Audi.
