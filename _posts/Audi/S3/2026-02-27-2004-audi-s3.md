### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Audi S3 offers a compelling blend of performance and practicality, but its advanced systems and turbocharged engine can present specific reliability challenges. Common issues revolve around the engine's PCV system, turbocharger, and ignition coils, as well as potential wear on manual transmission components like the clutch and synchros, or mechatronics and clutch pack issues in the DSG. Suspension components, particularly bushings and wheel bearings, can also require attention. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or window regulators, are not uncommon. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, diligent maintenance and addressing these specific potential issues are key to maintaining the S3's performance and reliability.
