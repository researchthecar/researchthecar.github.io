### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi S3 is a generally reliable performance vehicle. The 2.0L TFSI engine, while potent, can experience issues with the PCV valve and water pump as mileage accumulates. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission is more prone to potential issues like mechatronic unit failure or clutch wear compared to the manual gearbox, which is largely trouble-free. Electrical components, particularly the infotainment system and ABS/ESP sensors, may require attention. However, these are not typically widespread failures and often relate to specific component lifespan or software. Overall, the S3 offers a compelling blend of performance and dependability, with most potential issues being addressable through maintenance and repair.
