### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Audi S3 demonstrates good overall reliability, with the majority of reported issues being minor and related to specific components rather than systemic failures. The engine and transmission, while robust, are the primary areas where owners might encounter issues, particularly with the PCV valve, water pump, and the mechatronic unit or clutch packs in the S tronic transmission. Electrical gremlins, mainly concerning the infotainment system's software, are also noted. However, these are generally manageable with software updates or component replacements. Suspension, exterior, and interior components show a high degree of reliability. For prospective buyers, a pre-purchase inspection focusing on these potential weak points is advisable.
