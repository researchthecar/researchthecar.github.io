**Summary**

The 2000 Audi S3, while a fun and capable performance car, does have some common issues. The most pressing concerns often revolve around the turbocharged engine and associated components like the turbocharger itself, coil packs, and vacuum lines. Transmission issues, particularly clutch and synchro wear, are also common given the vehicle's age and performance-oriented nature. Suspension components wear and electrical problems can also arise. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs like turbocharger replacement or transmission work can be costly. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic specializing in Audi vehicles to identify any existing or potential problems. Addressing these issues proactively can help keep the S3 running reliably.
