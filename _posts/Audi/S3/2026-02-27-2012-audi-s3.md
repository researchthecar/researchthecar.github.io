### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi S3 offers a compelling blend of performance and premium features. Its 2.0L TFSI engine is generally reliable but can be prone to issues like PCV valve failure and carbon buildup, which are common in direct-injection engines of this era. The DSG transmission, while offering rapid shifts, has a higher potential for costly mechatronic unit or clutch pack issues compared to the manual. Suspension and electrical systems are typically robust. Overall, the S3 is a solid performer, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific powertrain components that may require attention and factor in potential maintenance costs, especially for the DSG gearbox.
