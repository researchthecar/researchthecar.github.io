The 2004 Audi S3 (8L chassis) is a sporty, compact hatchback known for its performance and quattro all-wheel-drive system. This model year features a single engine option: a 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-four cylinder engine (1.8T) rated at around 225 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option is a 6-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the S3's responsive handling, powerful engine for its size, and overall build quality. Common dislikes include the age-related maintenance issues that come with older performance vehicles and the potential for higher running costs compared to standard hatchbacks.

**Summary:** The 2004 Audi S3, while a fun and capable car, is now an older vehicle and is susceptible to age-related issues. Engine issues like coil pack failures and vacuum leaks are common and relatively inexpensive to address. More severe issues with the turbocharger or transmission can be costly. Suspension components and electrical gremlins can also contribute to the overall running costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchase decision. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
