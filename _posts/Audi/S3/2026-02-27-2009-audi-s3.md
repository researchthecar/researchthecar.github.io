# 2009 Audi S3

### Overview
The 2009 Audi S3, a performance-oriented variant of the A3 hatchback, is generally regarded as a robust and well-engineered vehicle. It typically features a potent 2.0-liter turbocharged TFSI engine paired with Audi's renowned quattro all-wheel-drive system, offering exhilarating performance and confident handling.
