The 2009 Audi S3 is a performance-oriented hatchback known for its sporty handling, powerful engine, and premium features. It only came in one engine and transmission option. The S3 featured a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing around 265 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Power was sent to all four wheels via a 6-speed manual transmission or an optional 6-speed S-tronic dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the S3 for its engaging driving dynamics and refined interior, while common complaints include potential for high repair costs and the need for premium fuel.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (BHZ)**

*   **Cam Follower Failure (High-Pressure Fuel Pump)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cam follower, which interfaces between the camshaft and the high-pressure fuel pump, can wear down prematurely. This leads to a ticking noise from the engine bay, reduced fuel pressure, rough idling, and potential engine damage if left unchecked.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam follower with an updated version. Regular inspection and replacement of the cam follower at scheduled intervals (e.g., every 20,000-30,000 miles) is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The diverter valve, responsible for regulating turbocharger boost, can fail. This manifests as a loss of power, hesitation during acceleration, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the diverter valve with an updated revision (e.g., a piston-type valve rather than a diaphragm type).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can occur in these engines. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and the need for frequent oil top-ups.
    *   Solution: The cause can vary (e.g., worn piston rings, valve stem seals, faulty PCV valve). Diagnosis is essential to determine the specific cause. Depending on the cause, repairs may involve replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or the PCV valve. In severe cases, a complete engine rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV Valve) - $3000+ (Engine Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage can occur, especially in tuned or heavily driven vehicles. Symptoms include the engine revving higher than expected during acceleration and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. Consider upgrading to a performance clutch if the vehicle is modified.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed S-Tronic (DSG)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit, which controls the gear changes, can fail. This leads to harsh shifting, hesitation, difficulty engaging gears, and potential complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the Mechatronic unit. It often requires specialized tools and expertise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **DSG Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dual-clutch system in the DSG transmission is subject to wear over time, especially in stop-and-go traffic or with aggressive driving. This manifests as jerky shifting, slippage, and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Replace the DSG clutch packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (if equipped) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The magnetic ride control shocks can fail, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, reduced handling performance, and potential warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty magnetic ride control shocks. These are often more expensive than standard shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ignition coil packs can fail, resulting in misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per coil pack
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The window regulator can fail, causing the window to be inoperable or move erratically.
    *   Solution: Replace the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof can become misaligned, leak, or the motor can fail, preventing it from opening or closing properly.
    * Solution: Realignment, resealing, or replacement of the motor or entire sunroof assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the issue
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory navigation system can experience glitches, software failures, or complete inoperability.
    *   Solution: Software updates, repair of the unit, or replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sticking Dashboard Buttons**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some dashboard buttons can become sticky or unresponsive over time.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the buttons or replacing the affected control panel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Audi S3, while a fun and capable vehicle, can suffer from some common issues, particularly related to its engine, transmission, and electrical systems. The engine's cam follower issue is relatively common and can be prevented with routine maintenance. Mechatronic unit failure and DSG clutch wear can be costly to repair. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchase considerations, including budgeting for potential maintenance and repairs. Regular maintenance and careful inspection are crucial to mitigating these risks.
