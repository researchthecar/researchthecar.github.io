The 2016 Audi S3 is a performance-oriented compact sedan/hatchback praised for its blend of luxury, sporty handling, and everyday usability. The primary engine option for the 2016 S3 is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine producing 292 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. This engine was offered with a 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the S3 for its quick acceleration, well-appointed interior, and Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Common complaints often revolve around the firm ride, particularly with the optional sport suspension, and the relatively small rear seat space.
