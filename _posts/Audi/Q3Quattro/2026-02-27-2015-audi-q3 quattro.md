### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi Q3 Quattro presents a generally reliable package, particularly in its core mechanicals when properly maintained. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the turbocharged engine's ancillary systems, such as the PCV valve and potential oil consumption, and the sophisticated S tronic dual-clutch transmission, which can experience issues with its mechatronic unit or clutch packs.

Regular servicing and addressing early symptoms promptly are key to mitigating these risks and ensuring long-term satisfaction with the Q3.
