Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2024 Audi Q4 e-tron, organized by category.

The 2024 Audi Q4 e-tron is an all-electric compact SUV that offers a blend of luxury and efficiency. It comes in several configurations, including the Q4 40 e-tron (RWD) and the Q4 50 e-tron (AWD). The Q4 40 e-tron delivers around 201 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque, while the Q4 50 e-tron boosts performance to around 295 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque.  Owners often praise the Q4 e-tron for its comfortable ride, stylish interior, and user-friendly technology. Some common dislikes include limited range compared to some competitors and the availability of premium features often requiring expensive packages.

**Electric Motor**

**Single Motor (Q4 40 e-tron)**
* **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances where the vehicle suddenly enters a "turtle mode," significantly reducing power output. This can happen even with a substantial battery charge and without any warning lights initially.  Eventually, a drivetrain malfunction warning may appear.
    * Solution: Diagnosis typically involves checking the battery management system (BMS), motor control unit, and related sensors. A software update to the BMS or motor control unit may resolve the issue. In some cases, a faulty sensor or component within the electric motor assembly might need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the cause and parts needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Dual Motor (Q4 50 e-tron)**
* **No Issues Found**

**Battery/Charging System**

* **Slow DC Fast Charging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Q4 e-tron's DC fast charging speed is sometimes criticized for being slower than some competitors.  While the car is rated for a specific charging speed, real-world performance can vary based on ambient temperature, battery temperature, and charging station capabilities.  Some owners find the charging curve (how quickly the charging rate tapers off as the battery fills) less aggressive than expected.
    * Solution: This is more of a characteristic of the vehicle's design and charging system. Ensure using a compatible and high-powered DC fast charging station. Preconditioning the battery (if available) before arriving at the charging station can help improve charging speeds.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (Characteristic of vehicle, not a repairable defect)
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Software Glitches Affecting Charging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Infrequent reports exist of software glitches impacting the charging process.  This can manifest as the car failing to initiate a charge, prematurely terminating a charge, or displaying incorrect charging information.
    * Solution: A software update from Audi is generally the solution.  A temporary workaround may involve resetting the infotainment system or attempting charging at a different station.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software update covered under warranty or as a service campaign)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezes/Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI infotainment system can occasionally freeze, lag, or experience glitches. This might include unresponsive touch controls, Bluetooth connectivity issues, or navigation errors.
    *   Solution: A software update from Audi is the most common solution. A temporary fix might involve a system reset (holding the power button).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software update covered under warranty or as a service campaign)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver Assist System Malfunctions (Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keep Assist)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent malfunctions of driver-assist features like adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist have been reported. These can range from the systems disengaging unexpectedly to providing inaccurate warnings.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the sensors (cameras, radar) and related control modules. A software update or recalibration of the sensors might be necessary. In some cases, a faulty sensor needs replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,200+ (depending on warranty coverage and the faulty component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 12V battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods. This can result in the car being unable to start or experiencing electrical system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Investigate parasitic draws on the 12V battery. This could be due to a faulty module or accessory that is not shutting down properly. A battery replacement and software update to improve battery management might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the cause of the drain and the need for a new battery)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the automatic tailgate failing to open or close properly. This can be due to a faulty actuator, sensor, or software glitch.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the tailgate system for faulty sensors or actuators. A software update might resolve the issue, but component replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the part requiring replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2024 Audi Q4 e-tron presents a generally reliable ownership experience, but, like any vehicle, it's not without potential issues. The most commonly reported problems involve the infotainment system, driver-assist features, and charging system quirks. The severity of these issues ranges from minor software glitches to more significant component failures. The cost to fix these problems varies widely, but many are covered under warranty, particularly those related to software or electrical components. The reports of reduced power on the Q4 40 is concerning but does not appear to be a widespread issue. It would be wise to pay special attention to the electrical systems and review the battery health report of the vehicle.
