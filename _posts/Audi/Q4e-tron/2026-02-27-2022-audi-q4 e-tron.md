# 2022 Audi Q4 e-tron

### Overview
The 2022 Audi Q4 e-tron represents Audi's entry into the compact electric SUV segment, offering a blend of premium features, technology, and electric performance. As an all-electric vehicle, its mechanical complexity differs significantly from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Key areas of focus for reliability in EVs include the battery pack, electric motors, charging system, and associated power electronics. While the Q4 e-tron is built on the Volkswagen Group's MEB platform, shared with other EVs, specific model year data is still emerging. Early reports suggest a generally positive reliability trend, with most concerns revolving around software glitches and initial setup of connected services rather than fundamental hardware failures. Owners generally appreciate its refined driving experience and practical interior space.
