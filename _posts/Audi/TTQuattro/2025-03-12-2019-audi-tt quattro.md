The 2019 Audi TT Quattro is a stylish and sporty coupe (also available as a roadster) known for its sleek design, engaging handling, and luxurious interior. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The TTS version is a higher-performance variant, that utilizes a tuned version of the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 288 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (S tronic). Owners generally praise the TT for its distinctive looks, nimble driving dynamics, and high-quality cabin. Downsides often cited include the limited rear seat space, a somewhat firm ride, and the cost of maintenance and repairs.
