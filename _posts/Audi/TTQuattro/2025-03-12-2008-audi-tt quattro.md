The 2008 Audi TT Quattro is a stylish and sporty coupe/roadster known for its distinctive design and engaging driving experience. This model year featured a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing around 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed dual-clutch S tronic transmission. Some owners appreciate the TT's nimble handling and refined interior, while others find the rear seats cramped (in the coupe) and the ride a bit firm. Common complaints often revolve around the cost of maintenance and potential issues with the electrical system and drivetrain components. The Quattro models provide all wheel drive.
