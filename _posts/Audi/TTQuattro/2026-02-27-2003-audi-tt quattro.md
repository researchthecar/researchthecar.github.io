### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Audi TT Quattro, while a stylish and engaging car, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and performance focus. The 1.8L turbocharged engines, available in two states of tune, can experience issues with the PCV system, ignition coils, and turbochargers, which are often related to age and high-performance demands. Manual transmissions are generally robust, but clutch wear is a common maintenance item. Automatic transmissions may develop fluid leaks or torque converter problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also noted areas for potential wear. Electrically, window regulators, HVAC resistors, and ABS/ESP modules can be points of failure. For the Roadster variant, the convertible top mechanism requires attention. Interior issues like pixelated displays are also frequently reported. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and addressing problems promptly, the 2003 TT Quattro can remain a rewarding vehicle.
