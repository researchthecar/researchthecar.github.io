The 2005 Audi TT Quattro is a sporty coupe or roadster that offers a blend of style and performance. The Quattro model is equipped with a 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine that produces 225 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2005 Audi TT include a 180 horsepower version of the same 1.8L Turbo engine, available only in front-wheel-drive models. Both engines are paired with either a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, or a 6-speed automatic transmission (Tiptronic). Owners often praise the TT for its distinctive design, nimble handling, and the confident grip provided by the Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Common complaints include concerns about reliability, the cramped rear seats (in the coupe), and the relatively firm ride.
