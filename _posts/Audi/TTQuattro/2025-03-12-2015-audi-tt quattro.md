The 2015 Audi TT Quattro is a stylish and sporty coupe/convertible known for its distinctive design, agile handling, and powerful turbocharged engine. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. Owners often praise the TT for its engaging driving experience, upscale interior, and advanced technology features. Common complaints include a somewhat firm ride, limited rear passenger space (in the coupe), and potential for higher maintenance costs compared to more mainstream vehicles.
