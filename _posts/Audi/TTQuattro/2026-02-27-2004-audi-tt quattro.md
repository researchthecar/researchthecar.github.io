### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Audi TT Quattro offers a compelling blend of style and performance. While its turbocharged engines and Quattro all-wheel-drive system are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues such as PCV system failures, ignition coil problems, and oil leaks, particularly on the higher-output 225hp variant. Transmission reliability is good for the manual, but automatic transmissions may experience issues with the TCM or torque converter. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear over time. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and HVAC resistors, are not uncommon. Exterior concerns include headlight condensation and convertible top mechanism issues for the Roadster. Interiorly, climate control display pixel loss and seat heater failures are noted. Overall, with proactive maintenance and attention to these specific areas, the 2004 TT Quattro can remain a reliable and enjoyable sports car.
