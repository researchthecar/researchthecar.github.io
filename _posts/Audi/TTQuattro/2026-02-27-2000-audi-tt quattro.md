### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Audi TT Quattro, while a stylish and engaging car, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of its age and performance focus. The turbocharged engines are prone to issues with the PCV system, ignition coils, and turbocharger itself. Transmissions, particularly automatics, can develop leaks or torque converter problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also known wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators, and exterior paint issues are not uncommon. Interior wear, especially on seats, should also be considered. Despite these potential issues, many TTs remain on the road with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
