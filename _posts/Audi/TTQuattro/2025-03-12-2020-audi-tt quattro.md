The 2020 Audi TT Quattro is a stylish and sporty coupe known for its engaging handling, premium interior, and distinctive design. The Quattro designation indicates the presence of Audi's all-wheel-drive system. The 2020 TT Quattro is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. Some owners appreciate the TT's nimble handling and sophisticated technology, while others find the rear seats cramped and the cargo space limited. Common criticisms often involve the infotainment system's learning curve and the ride quality on rough roads, as it can be somewhat firm.

**Summary**

The 2020 Audi TT Quattro, while a fun and stylish vehicle, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues such as coolant leaks, ignition coil failures, and turbocharger problems, though not extremely common, can be costly to repair. The S tronic transmission may experience Mechatronic unit failures or clutch slippage, which can also be expensive. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system, and suspension issues can also arise. Interior and exterior issues are usually cosmetic. While some of the repairs can be costly, overall the severity and frequency of the issues aren't generally considered excessive for a vehicle in this class. Prospective buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic familiar with Audi vehicles.
