The 2013 Audi TT Quattro is a stylish and sporty compact coupe, offering a blend of performance and luxury. The "Quattro" designation indicates Audi's renowned all-wheel-drive system. This model year primarily features a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine, producing around 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The engine is typically paired with a 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise the TT for its distinctive design, agile handling, and premium interior. However, some common criticisms include limited rear passenger space, a firm ride, and potential for costly repairs associated with European vehicles.
