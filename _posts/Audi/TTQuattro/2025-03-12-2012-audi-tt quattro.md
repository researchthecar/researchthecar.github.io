Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2012 Audi TT Quattro, formatted as requested.

The 2012 Audi TT Quattro is a sporty coupe/roadster offering a blend of style, performance, and all-weather capability thanks to its Quattro all-wheel-drive system.

Some owners appreciate the TT's distinctive design, nimble handling, and luxurious interior. Common criticisms include the small rear seats (in the coupe), limited cargo space, and potential for costly repairs, especially as the car ages.
