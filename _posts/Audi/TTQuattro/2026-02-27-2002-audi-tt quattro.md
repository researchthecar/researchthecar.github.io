### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Audi TT Quattro, particularly with its 1.8L turbocharged engines, presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues revolve around the PCV system, ignition coils, and potential oil leaks, which are not uncommon for turbocharged European cars of this era. The manual transmissions are generally robust, though clutch wear is a factor of usage. Automatic transmissions can be more prone to issues with the TCM and torque converter. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also noted areas for potential repair. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and dashboard display issues, are also reported. While not a maintenance-free vehicle, addressing these known issues can contribute to a more reliable ownership experience for this iconic sports car.
