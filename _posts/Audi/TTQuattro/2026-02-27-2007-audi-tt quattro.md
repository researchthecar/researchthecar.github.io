### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Audi TT Quattro offers a compelling blend of performance and style. While the 3.2L VR6 engine and manual transmission variants are generally robust with few reported major issues, the 2.0L TFSI engine can be prone to oil consumption and PCV valve problems. The DSG transmission, while offering quick shifts, has a higher potential for costly mechatronic unit and clutch pack issues. Electrical components like window regulators and HVAC resistors are also noted as potential failure points. Regular maintenance and proactive monitoring of oil levels are crucial for the TFSI engine. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues, especially when considering models with the DSG transmission.
