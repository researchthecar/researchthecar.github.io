The 2018 Audi TT Quattro is a sporty coupe/roadster offering a blend of style, performance, and luxury. In addition to the Quattro, the TT was also offered in a front-wheel-drive configuration. The 2018 TT Quattro is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the TT for its distinctive design, agile handling, and upscale interior. Common criticisms include limited rear passenger space (in the coupe), a firm ride, and relatively small cargo area.

**Summary**

The 2018 Audi TT Quattro, while a stylish and fun-to-drive vehicle, has its share of potential issues. The engine can suffer from coolant leaks, ignition coil failures, and carbon buildup. The dual-clutch transmission may experience Mechatronic unit problems and clutch wear. Suspension issues, particularly with the MagRide system, and electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sensors are also potential concerns. The costs associated with these repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major component replacements. The most common issue is the carbon buildup on the intake valves.
