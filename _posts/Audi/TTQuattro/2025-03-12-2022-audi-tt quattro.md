The 2022 Audi TT Quattro is a stylish and sporty coupe known for its distinctive design, engaging driving dynamics, and well-appointed interior. It typically comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque for the standard model, and a higher output of approximately 306 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque for the TTS variant. Both are paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. Owners often appreciate the TT's sharp handling, responsive engine, and user-friendly technology. Some common dislikes include the limited rear passenger space (as it's primarily a 2+2), relatively firm ride, and the higher price point compared to some competitors.
