The 2016 Audi TT Quattro is a sporty coupe known for its sleek design, nimble handling, and advanced technology. Powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, it offers a spirited driving experience. While only the 2.0L engine was available, transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic. Owners often praise the TT's stylish interior, responsive steering, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space and relatively firm ride quality.
