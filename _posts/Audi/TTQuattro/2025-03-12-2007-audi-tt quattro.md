The 2007 Audi TT Quattro is a sporty coupe known for its distinctive design, engaging handling, and turbocharged performance. The Quattro model features Audi's all-wheel-drive system for enhanced traction. In 2007, the TT was available with a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine, producing around 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque in the standard TT, and a 3.2L VR6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque in the TT Quattro. Both engines came standard with a 6-speed manual transmission. The 2.0L turbo was also available with a 6-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic transmission, while the VR6 was available with a 6-speed automatic Tiptronic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the TT's stylish looks, nimble handling, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include the small rear seats, limited cargo space, and potential for costly repairs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (BPY)**

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, reduced power, possible check engine light. The diaphragm inside the diverter valve can tear, causing a leak.
    *   Solution: Replace the diverter valve. Many owners upgrade to a stronger aftermarket valve to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Follower Wear/Failure (High-Pressure Fuel Pump)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, loss of power, rough running, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed. The cam follower, which rides on the camshaft lobe and actuates the high-pressure fuel pump, can wear down, leading to the pump failing.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam follower. Regular inspection and replacement are recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per coil
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L VR6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, potential for severe engine damage if the chain stretches or breaks. The timing chains on the VR6 can stretch over time, leading to timing issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chains, guides, and tensioners. This is a labor-intensive job.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed DSG (02E)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, delayed engagement, inability to shift gears, flashing gear indicator light on the dashboard. The Mechatronic unit is the electro-hydraulic control unit for the DSG transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the Mechatronic unit. Some can be repaired, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, jerky shifts, shuddering when starting from a stop. The DSG uses two clutches, which can wear out over time, especially with aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking struts, uneven ride height, warning lights on the dashboard, diminished ride quality. The magnetic ride suspension uses fluid-filled struts with adjustable damping. These struts can leak or fail over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty struts. Can be expensive, as the struts are specific to the magnetic ride system. Owners often convert to standard struts to save money
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per strut (replacement); $1000 - $2000 (conversion to standard suspension)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent gauge failures, display issues, warning lights malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Convenience Control Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with power windows, door locks, interior lights, and alarm system.
    *   Solution: Replace the Central Convenience Control Module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Spoiler Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear spoiler fails to extend or retract properly. This can be due to a faulty motor or sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the spoiler motor or sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag warning light illuminated on the dashboard. Often caused by a faulty sensor in the seats or a loose connection.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific fault using a diagnostic scanner and repair or replace the faulty sensor or connection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Audi TT Quattro can be a fun and stylish car, but it's important to be aware of the potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine, particularly timing chain issues on the 3.2L VR6, and the DSG transmission, with its potential Mechatronic unit failures. Electrical issues and suspension problems (especially with the magnetic ride system) can also be costly to address. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars depending on the problem. Thorough inspection and maintenance are crucial for keeping a 2007 Audi TT Quattro in good condition.
