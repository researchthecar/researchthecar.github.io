### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Audi A8, while a luxurious and generally well-built vehicle, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of high-end German sedans with complex systems. The most frequently reported issues revolve around the adaptive air suspension, particularly air spring leaks and compressor failures, which can be costly to repair. Engine-specific problems, such as PCV valve failures on the V6 and ignition coil or turbocharger issues on the V8, are also noted. Transmission concerns, primarily related to the mechatronic unit and torque converter, can lead to significant repair bills. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment system and lighting modules, can also arise. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners report a positive ownership experience, provided regular maintenance is performed and potential issues are addressed promptly.
