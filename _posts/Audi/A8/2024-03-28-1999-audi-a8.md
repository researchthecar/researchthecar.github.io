**1999 Audi A8**

The 1999 Audi A8 was a full-size luxury sedan that was offered with a choice of three engines: a 3.7-liter V8, a 4.2-liter V8, and a 6.0-liter W12. The 3.7-liter V8 produced 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, while the 4.2-liter V8 produced 310 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque.
