The 2000 Audi A8 is a luxury sedan known for its sophisticated styling, comfortable ride, and advanced technology for its time. For the 2000 model year, the A8 was available with two engine options: a 2.8L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.2L V8 producing 310 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the A8 for its comfortable and quiet cabin, secure handling due to the Quattro all-wheel-drive system, and the impressive fit and finish. Criticisms often revolve around the high cost of maintenance and repairs, the complexity of the electronics, and the potential for expensive issues to arise as the car ages.

**Engine**

**2.8L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.8L V6 is an interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, the pistons can collide with the valves, causing significant engine damage. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, and eventually, complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, water pump, tensioners, and pulleys at the recommended interval (typically every 75,000-100,000 miles) to prevent failure. If the timing belt has already failed, the engine may require a complete rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.2L V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft adjusters on the 4.2L V8 can fail, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, and a "check engine" light. Error codes related to camshaft timing correlation may be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft adjusters. This often involves removing the timing belt and other components, increasing labor costs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are common in the 4.2L V8, often stemming from the plastic coolant pipes located under the intake manifold. Leaks can lead to overheating and engine damage if not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: Replace the plastic coolant pipes with upgraded aluminum or reinforced plastic versions. Replacing the water pump and thermostat at the same time is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, causing slipping, shuddering, and difficulty shifting. This is more common in higher-mileage vehicles.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It is often recommended to rebuild the transmission at the same time, as the torque converter failure may have introduced debris into the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the valve body can result in harsh or delayed shifting, and in some cases, complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. In some cases, a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system, while offering a smooth ride, is prone to leaks in the air struts or compressor failure. This leads to the car sitting lower than normal, a "suspension fault" warning light, and a bumpy ride.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air struts, repair or replace the air compressor, and check for leaks in the air lines. Converting to a coilover suspension system is also an option for some owners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The control arm bushings can wear out over time, leading to clunking noises from the suspension, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixel Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LCD screen in the instrument cluster can experience pixel failure, making it difficult to read the information displayed.
    *   Solution: Replace or repair the instrument cluster. Replacement can be expensive, but specialized repair services are available to fix the LCD screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Central Locking System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system can malfunction, causing doors to not lock or unlock properly, or the alarm to trigger unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the faulty door lock actuators, wiring, or central locking control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding/Yellowing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic headlight lenses can become cloudy or yellowed over time, reducing headlight output and visibility.
    *   Solution: Polish the headlight lenses to remove the oxidation, or replace the headlight assemblies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (DIY) - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof motor can fail, or the sunroof tracks can become damaged, preventing the sunroof from opening or closing properly.
    * Solution: Replace the sunroof motor, repair or replace the sunroof tracks, or replace the entire sunroof assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Audi A8, while a luxurious and well-engineered vehicle, is prone to several common issues as it ages. The engine and transmission can suffer from relatively expensive failures, especially with the 4.2L V8's camshaft adjusters and coolant leaks. The air suspension is another area of concern due to its complexity and potential for leaks. Electrical problems, such as instrument cluster pixel failure and central locking issues, can also be frustrating. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate to severe, and the cost of repair can be significant, making thorough inspection and maintenance history review essential before purchasing a used 2000 Audi A8.
