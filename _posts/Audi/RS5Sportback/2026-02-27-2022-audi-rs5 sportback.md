## Engine

### 2.9L Twin-Turbo V6
**Oil Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level warnings.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of leaking seals or gaskets (e.g., valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket).
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**Turbocharger Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced engine power, whistling noises from the engine bay, boost pressure warning lights.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential repair or replacement of turbocharger units or associated plumbing.
- **Cost:** $1500 - $3000


## Transmission

### 8-Speed Tiptronic Automatic
**Harsh Shifting / Hesitation**
- **Symptoms:** Jerky gear changes, delayed engagement, transmission warning lights.
- **Solution:** Software updates for the transmission control module, or internal transmission repairs/rebuild if mechanical failure is present.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2500


## Suspension

### Adaptive Sport Suspension
**Electronic Damper Malfunction**
- **Symptoms:** Stiff or overly soft ride, suspension warning lights, clunking noises over bumps.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and replacement of faulty adaptive dampers or control modules.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500 per corner


## Electrical

### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Audi RS5 Sportback generally offers a solid reliability record for a performance vehicle, with its powerful 2.9L twin-turbo V6 and advanced drivetrain being robust. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil leaks from the engine and occasional turbocharger problems, which are not uncommon in high-performance applications. The transmission, while generally smooth, can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Suspension components, especially the adaptive dampers, can be costly to repair if they fail. Exterior lighting and interior climate control are less frequent but still reported issues. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for maintaining the RS5's performance and longevity.
