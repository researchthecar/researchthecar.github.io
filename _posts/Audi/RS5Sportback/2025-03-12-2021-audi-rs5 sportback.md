The 2021 Audi RS5 Sportback is a performance-oriented four-door coupe, known for its stylish design, powerful engine, and refined driving experience. All 2021 RS5 Sportback models are equipped with a 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 444 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission (ZF 8HP55A). Owners generally praise the car's acceleration, handling, and luxurious interior. Common complaints revolve around the high price point, firm ride (especially with the optional sport suspension), and the infotainment system's complexity.

**Engine**

**2.9L Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure, leading to a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or screeching), and potential engine damage. Error codes may appear, and the car may enter limp mode.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement is typically required. It's important to diagnose the root cause of the failure (e.g., oil starvation, faulty wastegate) to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur at various points in the cooling system, including hoses, the water pump, or the coolant expansion tank. Symptoms include a low coolant warning light, visible coolant puddles, and engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak. This may involve replacing hoses, gaskets, the water pump, or the expansion tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ depending on the location and extent of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are relatively common, often originating from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak by replacing the affected gaskets or seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the location and extent of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 8HP55A 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation during acceleration or when downshifting is also a common complaint.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report torque converter issues, such as shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially under light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement may be necessary. Flushing the transmission fluid and inspecting for debris is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adaptive dampers (if equipped with the optional dynamic ride control) can sometimes malfunction, leading to a harsh or inconsistent ride quality. Error messages related to the suspension system may appear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool is required to identify the faulty damper. Replacement of the affected damper is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per damper (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Creaking/Popping Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported creaking or popping noises emanating from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning at low speeds. This can be caused by worn sway bar bushings, ball joints, or control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the specific components needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may require a system reboot to restore functionality.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often released to address these issues. If the problem persists, a hardware replacement (e.g., MMI unit) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (MMI unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions with various sensors, such as parking sensors or blind spot monitoring, can occur. These can result in false alarms, system deactivation, or warning lights.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Audi RS5 Sportback is a high-performance vehicle with a number of reported issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine (turbocharger failure, coolant/oil leaks) and transmission (rough shifting). Electrical issues with the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions are also fairly common. Suspension issues with the adaptive dampers and creaking noises add to the potential ownership costs. While many of these issues are not universal, they can be expensive to repair, potentially costing several thousand dollars, especially for major engine or transmission work. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended.
