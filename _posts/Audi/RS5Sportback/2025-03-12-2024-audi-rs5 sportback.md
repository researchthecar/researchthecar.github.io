**Engine**

**2.9L Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure, characterized by a loss of power, unusual whistling noises from the engine bay, and potential error codes related to turbocharger performance.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement, including inspection of related components (oil lines, boost pressure sensors).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported coolant leaks originating from various points within the engine bay, including coolant hoses, water pump, and the coolant reservoir. This can result in low coolant levels, overheating, and a sweet smell emanating from the engine bay.
    * Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the affected component. This may involve replacing coolant hoses, the water pump, the coolant reservoir, or other related parts. A coolant system pressure test can help pinpoint the leak.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+, depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or delayed shifting, particularly when downshifting or during cold starts. Hesitation upon acceleration has also been reported. This could be due to the transmission computer needing a software flash, or potentially deeper issues with the valve body.
    *   Solution: First, attempt a transmission control module (TCM) software update. If that doesn't resolve the issue, further diagnostics, potentially including valve body inspection or replacement, might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $3,000+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the mechatronic unit, which controls the transmission's hydraulic functions, can cause erratic shifting, failure to engage gears, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the mechatronic unit. This often involves reprogramming and adaptation of the new unit to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the adaptive dampers (if equipped), leading to uneven ride quality, error messages on the dashboard related to the suspension system, and potentially clunking noises from the affected corner of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty adaptive damper. Calibration of the suspension system may also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI infotainment system may experience freezing, crashing, or intermittent functionality, requiring a system reboot or causing temporary loss of access to features like navigation, audio, and climate control.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system software update. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Driver Assist Systems)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors, lane departure warning, or adaptive cruise control may malfunction intermittently or completely fail, generating error messages and impairing the functionality of these driver assistance features.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the affected sensor and recalibration of the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, plus labor for calibration
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported various rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear hatch area, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and applying felt tape, tightening loose fasteners, or replacing worn clips/bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the complexity and location of the noise.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctioning (getting stuck open or closed), loud noises when operating, or water leaks.
    *   Solution: Inspection and lubrication of the sunroof tracks and mechanism. Repair or replacement of faulty components (motor, seals, tracks).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
