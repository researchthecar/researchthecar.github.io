The 3.0L supercharged V6 engine, while potent, can experience issues like supercharger belt wear and PCV valve failure, which are not uncommon for this type of forced induction. The Tiptronic automatic transmission has seen reports of mechatronic unit and torque converter problems, which can be costly to repair. The manual transmission, however, appears to be very robust.

Overall, the S4 is a reliable performance sedan, but owners should be aware of potential costs associated with its advanced systems and performance-oriented nature.
