Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Audi S4, categorized by major components.

The 2019 Audi S4 is a performance-oriented sedan offering a blend of luxury and sportiness. It's powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine, producing 349 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The engine is exclusively paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission (Tiptronic). Owners generally praise the S4 for its quick acceleration, comfortable interior, and sharp handling. Common criticisms include the somewhat sterile driving feel compared to rivals like the BMW 3 Series, and some infotainment system quirks.
