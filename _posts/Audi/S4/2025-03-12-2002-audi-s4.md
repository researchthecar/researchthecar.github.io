The 2002 Audi S4 is a performance-oriented version of the A4 sedan, known for its powerful engine and quattro all-wheel-drive system. It came equipped with a 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine, producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the S4 for its engaging driving experience, sophisticated styling, and comfortable interior. Common complaints revolve around the high cost of maintenance and the age-related reliability issues inherent in a performance car of this era.

**Engine**

**2.7L Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises, loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger(s). It's often recommended to replace both turbos at the same time to ensure balanced performance and avoid future issues. Also, inspect and replace any related oil lines, check valves, and breather hoses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on whether one or both turbos are replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a preventative maintenance issue. If the timing belt fails, it can cause catastrophic engine damage due to interference engine design. Symptoms of a worn timing belt may include ticking noises, misfires, rough idling, or difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, water pump, tensioner, and idler pulleys at the recommended interval (typically every 75,000 miles).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various locations, including the coolant reservoir, hoses, and the "valley pan" gasket under the intake manifold. These leaks can lead to overheating and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the affected parts. Replacing the valley pan gasket is labor-intensive and requires removing the intake manifold. Pressure testing the system helps identify all leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor performance, and a check engine light are common symptoms. Vacuum leaks can occur in numerous locations due to the age of the rubber hoses and fittings.
    *   Solution: Smoke test the intake system to locate the leaks and replace the faulty hoses, fittings, or check valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the location and number of leaks)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, and unusual noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. It is often recommended to replace the flywheel at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (Tiptronic)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping between gears, and harsh engagement of gears. This is often related to the age of the transmission fluid and potential wear in the valve body.
    *   Solution: First, perform a transmission fluid flush using the correct fluid specification. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. In severe cases, the entire transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for a fluid flush; $800 - $2000+ for valve body repair/replacement; $2500 - $5000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, vague steering, and uneven tire wear. The front upper and lower control arm bushings are particularly prone to failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arms or bushings. Some aftermarket options offer upgraded bushings for improved performance and durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per corner (depending on whether the entire control arm or just the bushings are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Damper Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, and poor handling. Leaking fluid around the shock absorber is an indication of failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed shock absorber(s). It's recommended to replace shocks in pairs (front or rear) to maintain balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per shock absorber (depending on brand and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixel Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels within the instrument cluster display become unreadable or disappear entirely. This is a common issue with the LCD screens in these older Audis.
    *   Solution: The cluster can be repaired by replacing the LCD screen, or the entire cluster can be replaced. Some repair services specialize in fixing these displays.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the door locks, including the remote locking function.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock module. This involves removing the door panel and accessing the module within the door.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window dropping into the door, slow or erratic window movement, or complete failure of the window to operate.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof failing to open or close properly, jamming, or making unusual noises. The plastic guides and mechanisms are prone to breakage.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the sunroof mechanism, including the guides and cables.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Audi S4, while a desirable performance sedan, is prone to age-related issues. Engine problems, particularly those related to the turbos and timing belt, can be quite costly to repair. Suspension components like control arm bushings and dampers are also common failure points. Electrical issues, such as instrument cluster pixel failure and door lock module failure, are frequently reported. Overall, maintaining a 2002 Audi S4 requires a proactive approach and a willingness to invest in potentially expensive repairs.
