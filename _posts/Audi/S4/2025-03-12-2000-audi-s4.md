The 2000 Audi S4 is a performance sedan known for its turbocharged engine, Quattro all-wheel-drive system, and sporty handling. The sole engine option available was a 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged V6, producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally praise the S4 for its engaging driving experience and potential for modification. Criticisms often center on the car's age-related reliability issues and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**2.7T V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise, loss of power, excessive oil consumption, and potential smoke from the exhaust. The turbos on the 2.7T are prone to failure due to age, heat, and oil starvation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger(s). It is often recommended to replace both turbos simultaneously to ensure even performance and avoid future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on turbo brand and if doing the work DIY).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7T is an interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, the valves will collide with the pistons causing catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms of a failing belt include ticking noises or misfires.
    *   Solution: Scheduled timing belt replacement every 75,000 - 100,000 miles is critical. The service should include replacing the water pump, tensioner, and idler pulleys.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500 (for the timing belt service). If the belt breaks and damages the engine, the cost can be $3,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Temperature Sensor (CTS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Incorrect temperature readings, poor fuel economy, difficulty starting, and potential overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CTS.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**
