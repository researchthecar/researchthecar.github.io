The 2011 Audi S4 is a performance-oriented sedan that offers a blend of luxury and sporty driving dynamics. The standard and most common engine option is a supercharged 3.0-liter V6, producing 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. This engine was available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed S-tronic dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the car's quick acceleration, precise handling, and comfortable interior. However, some common complaints include higher-than-average maintenance costs, potential issues with the timing chain, and the dual-clutch transmission's behavior at low speeds.

**Summary**

The 2011 Audi S4, while a desirable performance sedan, can suffer from a range of issues. The most concerning are the potential engine problems (timing chain, thermostat, and PCV) and transmission issues with the S-Tronic dual-clutch. Repairs for these can be quite costly. Suspension components and various electrical issues are also relatively common. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential expenses and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing, paying close attention to service records and addressing any unusual noises or symptoms. While issues are not abundant, the severity and cost can be quite high.
