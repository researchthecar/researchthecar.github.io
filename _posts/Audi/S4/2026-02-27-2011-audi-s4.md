### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Audi S4 is a capable performance sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 3.0L supercharged V6, while powerful, can be prone to oil consumption and PCV valve issues. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission is a highlight for performance but has documented issues with its mechatronic unit and clutch packs, which can be costly to repair. While the manual transmission is generally robust, the automatic variant requires careful consideration. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and tail lights, are also noted. Suspension components, especially the adaptive system, can also present repair costs. Regular maintenance and thorough pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended for this model.
