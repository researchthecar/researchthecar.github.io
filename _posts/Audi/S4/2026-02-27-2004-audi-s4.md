### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Audi S4 offers thrilling performance but requires diligent maintenance and awareness of its common weak points. The V8 engine's timing chain system is a significant concern, demanding costly repairs if it fails. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can also be expensive. Suspension components are prone to wear, and electrical gremlins like window regulators can surface.
