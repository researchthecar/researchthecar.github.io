The 2001 Audi S4 is a high-performance variant of the A4 sedan. It features a 4.2-liter V8 engine that produces 349 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque. The S4 comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission, but a five-speed automatic transmission was also available.

**Engine**

**4.2-liter V8**

* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to jump and potentially damage the engine. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, loss of power, and engine failure. Replacing the timing chain tensioner typically costs around $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **Valve cover gasket leak:** The valve cover gaskets can leak oil into the engine compartment. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels. Replacing the valve cover gaskets typically costs around $500 - $1,000.
* **Ignition coil failure:** The ignition coils can fail, causing the engine to misfire or run poorly. Symptoms include a rough idle, loss of power, and check engine light. Replacing ignition coils typically costs around $100 - $200 per coil.

**Transmission**

**Six-speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch can wear out or fail, making it difficult to shift gears or causing the transmission to slip. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, slipping gears, and chatter from the clutch. Replacing the clutch typically costs around $1,500 - $2,500.

**Five-speed Automatic**

* **Transmission control module (TCM) failure:** The TCM can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or not shift at all. Symptoms include harsh shifting, delayed shifting, and transmission failure. Replacing the TCM typically costs around $1,000 - $2,000.
* **Shift solenoid failure:** The shift solenoids can fail, causing the transmission to shift improperly or not shift at all. Symptoms include harsh shifting, delayed shifting, and transmission failure. Replacing shift solenoids typically costs around $300 - $500 per solenoid.

**Suspension**

* **Control arm bushings:** The control arm bushings can wear out or fail, causing the suspension to feel loose or unstable. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Replacing control arm bushings typically costs around $500 - $1,000 per side.
* **Shock absorbers:** The shock absorbers can wear out or fail, causing the suspension to feel stiff or bouncy. Symptoms include a rough ride, poor handling, and leaking shock absorbers. Replacing shock absorbers typically costs around $500 - $1,000 per axle.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to not charge and the vehicle to lose power. Symptoms include a dim or flickering dashboard, loss of power, and a check engine light. Replacing the alternator typically costs around $500 - $1,000.
* **Starter failure:** The starter can fail, preventing the engine from starting. Symptoms include a clicking noise when trying to start the engine, no cranking, and a check engine light. Replacing the starter typically costs around $300 - $500.

**Summary**

The 2001 Audi S4 is a powerful and stylish performance sedan. However, it is also known for having some potential reliability issues, particularly with the engine and transmission.
