The 2017 Audi S4 is a performance-oriented sedan that boasts a sophisticated design and a thrilling driving experience. The sole engine option is a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine, producing 354 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with an eight-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the S4 for its quick acceleration, sharp handling, comfortable interior, and advanced technology features.
