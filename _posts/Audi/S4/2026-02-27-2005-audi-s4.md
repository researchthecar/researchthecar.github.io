# 2005 Audi S4

### Overview
The 2005 Audi S4, a performance-oriented variant of the A4, is known for its potent V8 engine and engaging driving dynamics. However, like many high-performance vehicles of its era, it presents a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. While the core mechanical components can be robust when properly maintained, certain areas are prone to specific, often costly, issues. Owners should be particularly aware of potential problems related to the engine's timing chain system, the complex electrical systems, and the unique demands placed on the suspension and drivetrain due to its performance tuning. Despite these potential pitfalls, a well-maintained 2005 S4 can still offer an exhilarating driving experience, but prospective buyers should factor in the possibility of significant maintenance and repair costs.

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Audi S4 is a performance car with associated maintenance demands. Its V8 engine, while powerful, is susceptible to costly timing chain guide and tensioner failures, which are the most significant concern. Transmission reliability is generally good for the manual, but automatics can develop torque converter issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with power windows and infotainment, can also arise. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, the mechanical and electrical systems require diligent maintenance and a budget for potential repairs. It's a car that rewards passionate owners but demands significant investment to maintain its performance and reliability.
