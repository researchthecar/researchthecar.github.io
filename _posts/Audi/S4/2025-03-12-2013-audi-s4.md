The 2013 Audi S4 is a performance-oriented sedan that appeals to enthusiasts seeking a blend of luxury and sportiness. This model year features a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 engine producing 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. It was offered with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the S4's responsive acceleration, sharp handling, and upscale interior. However, some common criticisms include potential reliability issues and higher maintenance costs compared to some of its competitors.

**Engine**

**3.0L Supercharged V6**

* **Thermostat Housing Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, often manifesting as a pink crusty residue around the thermostat housing or coolant pooling under the car. Can lead to overheating.
    * Solution: Replacement of the thermostat housing and gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, whistling sound from the engine, oil leaks, increased oil consumption, and potentially a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacement of the PCV valve assembly. Some later revisions of the PCV valve are more robust.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leak, and potential engine damage if not addressed quickly. The plastic impeller on the original water pump is prone to failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the water pump, preferably with an updated version featuring a metal impeller.

    * Recalls: None Found

* **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, decreased fuel economy, and check engine light. Direct injection engines are susceptible to carbon buildup on the intake valves due to the lack of fuel washing over the valves.
    * Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (e.g., walnut blasting) or chemical cleaning.

**Summary:**

The 2013 Audi S4 offers an engaging driving experience but is prone to certain reliability concerns. Engine issues such as thermostat housing leaks, PCV valve failures, water pump failures, and carbon buildup are common. The S tronic transmission can experience costly mechatronic unit failures and clutch pack wear. Suspension issues such as control arm bushing failures also arise. Electrical and Interior issues are relatively less frequent. Repair costs can be substantial, especially for transmission and engine-related problems. Potential buyers should have these issues inspected before purchasing and budget for maintenance and repairs.
