### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi S4 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, with its 3.0L supercharged V6 and quattro AWD being the highlights. While the manual transmission is generally robust, the S tronic dual-clutch automatic can present costly issues like mechatronic unit failures and clutch wear. The supercharged V6, though powerful, is prone to PCV valve failures and oil leaks, requiring diligent maintenance. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and tail lights, are also noted. Despite these potential drawbacks, with proper maintenance and addressing known issues proactively, the 2012 S4 can remain a reliable and exhilarating vehicle for enthusiasts.
