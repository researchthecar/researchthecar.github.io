The 2018 Audi S4 is a performance sedan known for its blend of luxury, technology, and exhilarating driving experience. It came standard with a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine producing 354 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission (Tiptronic). Owners typically praise the S4's responsive engine, sharp handling, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include the somewhat muted exhaust note compared to rivals, and the potential for expensive repairs as the car ages.

*   **Thermostat Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the thermostat housing, often accompanied by a low coolant warning light and the smell of coolant.
    *   Solution: Replace the thermostat housing and gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks, and potentially engine damage if not addressed promptly. The water pump impeller may fail.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Tiptronic)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or delayed shifts, particularly between lower gears. Some owners report hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or adaptive learning reset can improve shift quality. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Software Update) - $4,000+ (Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Malfunction (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Error messages related to the suspension system, uneven ride quality, and noticeable clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific damper and wiring. Replacement of the faulty damper is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: A software update is often the first step. If that doesn't resolve the issue, the MMI unit itself may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (Software Update), $1200 - $2500+ (MMI Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Audi S4 is generally a reliable vehicle, but certain issues are more prevalent than others. Engine cooling system components (thermostat housing, water pump) and electrical glitches in the infotainment system and sensors seem to be the most commonly reported. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can be quite expensive to resolve. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potential engine damage, and the cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the specific problem and the shop performing the work. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
