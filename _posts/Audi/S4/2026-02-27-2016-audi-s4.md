### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Audi S4 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, with a generally solid reliability record. The 3.0L supercharged V6 engine is robust, though common issues like PCV valve failures and oil leaks from valve cover gaskets can occur and should be monitored. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission, while offering quick shifts, has had reports of mechatronic unit and clutch pack issues, which can be costly to repair. The manual transmission is typically more trouble-free. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are not uncommon but often resolvable with software updates. Overall, the S4 is a reliable performance sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific transmission and engine component vulnerabilities and factor in potential repair costs.
