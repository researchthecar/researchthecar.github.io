    * Solution: While not a complete fix, some owners have found that a software update or transmission control module (TCM) reflash from the dealer can improve shift smoothness and reduce the hesitation. In some cases, a full transmission replacement might be needed if it's a mechanical issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (software update), $6,000 - $8,000+ (transmission replacement)

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update, covered under warranty), $800 - $1,500+ (MMI control unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Faulty sensors causing malfunction of safety features, such as lane assist, adaptive cruise control, or parking sensors. Error messages appear on the dashboard, and the affected system may not function correctly.
