### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Audi S4 (B5) is a performance icon with a complex twin-turbo V6 engine that, while powerful, is prone to specific issues such as turbocharger failure, PCV system problems, and coolant leaks. Transmission reliability varies between manual and automatic, with clutch wear being common on manuals and torque converter issues on automatics. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also known to wear. Electrical gremlins, including window regulators and ignition coils, are not uncommon. Exterior paint and interior electronics, particularly the instrument cluster display, can also present problems. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential costs and prioritize vehicles with thorough maintenance records.
