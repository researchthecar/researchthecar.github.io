**Summary**

The 2024 Audi S4, while generally a reliable and enjoyable vehicle, can be subject to several issues as it ages. The most concerning issues appear to be related to the engine cooling system (coolant leaks) and the potential for carbon buildup, which can affect engine performance. Additionally, the transmission can have issues with rough shifting, which can become costly to repair. Other issues such as electrical glitches and interior rattles are less severe, but can still impact the overall ownership experience. While the S4 delivers impressive performance and luxury, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the potential cost of repairs.
