The 2001 Audi S4 is a performance-oriented sedan that offers a blend of luxury and sporty driving dynamics. It primarily features a 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine, producing around 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. While a smaller naturally aspirated V6 was available in the A4, the S4 exclusively utilized the 2.7T. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the S4's powerful engine, quattro all-wheel-drive system, and understated styling. Common complaints revolve around the age of the vehicle and the associated maintenance costs, particularly concerning the complex turbocharging system and potential electrical gremlins. Parts availability and high labor costs contribute to the overall cost of ownership.
