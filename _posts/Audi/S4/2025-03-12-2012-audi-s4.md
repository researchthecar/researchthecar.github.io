The 2012 Audi S4 is a performance-oriented sedan that offers a blend of luxury and sportiness. The sole engine option for this year is the supercharged 3.0-liter TFSI V6, producing 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally praise the S4 for its responsive engine, engaging driving dynamics, and comfortable interior.
