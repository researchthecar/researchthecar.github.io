### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Audi S4 is a capable performance sedan with a generally good reliability record, though it's not without its potential issues. The 4.2L V8 engine, while powerful, is prone to carbon buildup and can consume oil, requiring diligent maintenance and occasional specialized cleaning. Transmission reliability varies; the manual is generally robust, but the S tronic automatic can experience issues with its mechatronic unit and clutch packs. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are not uncommon. Suspension and exterior/interior components are typically solid. Prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for higher maintenance costs associated with performance vehicles and factor in potential repairs for the known engine and transmission weaknesses.
