### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Audi S4 offers exhilarating performance, but its complexity, particularly the V8 engine and available automatic transmission, can lead to significant repair costs. The timing chain system is a notable concern requiring substantial investment if it fails. Carbon buildup is also common on direct-injection engines of this era. While the manual transmission is generally more robust, clutch wear is a typical maintenance item. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and infotainment issues, can also arise. Owners should budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the engine and drivetrain, and ensure regular, high-quality maintenance to mitigate these risks. Despite these potential issues, a well-maintained S4 can still provide an engaging driving experience.
