The 2019 Audi A4 allroad is a popular wagon known for its blend of practicality, comfort, and all-weather capability. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. The engine is exclusively paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2019 Audi A4 allroad generally exhibits good reliability, but potential buyers should be aware of a few common issues. The most frequently reported problems revolve around the engine (coolant leaks, oil consumption) and the transmission (hesitation/rough shifting). Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and backup camera, can also occur. While the majority of these issues are not catastrophic, repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for more significant repairs like mechatronic unit replacement or piston ring replacement. It is always advisable to obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic before buying a used Audi A4 allroad.
