### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Audi A4 allroad is a competent vehicle with a generally solid reliability record. The most frequently cited technical concerns revolve around the 2.0L TFSI engine, particularly regarding oil consumption, PCV valve failures, and potential timing chain issues, which can be costly to repair. For models equipped with the S tronic dual-clutch transmission, issues with the mechatronic unit and clutch packs have been noted. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and sensor failures, can also arise. However, the Tiptronic automatic transmission and the suspension system have proven to be quite robust. Regular maintenance and addressing early signs of engine oil consumption are key to ensuring long-term reliability.
