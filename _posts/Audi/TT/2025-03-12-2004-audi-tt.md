The 2004 Audi TT is a sporty coupe/roadster known for its distinctive styling and fun-to-drive character. The 2004 model year was available with two engine options: a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 producing either 180 horsepower and 173 lb-ft of torque (FWD) or 225 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque (AWD), and a 3.2L VR6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque (AWD). The 1.8T engines were available with a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, or a 6-speed automatic transmission (called Tiptronic). The VR6 came standard with a 6-speed manual, and later models could be optioned with a DSG dual-clutch transmission. Owners often appreciate the TT's sharp handling, iconic design, and relatively fuel-efficient engines. Downsides often cited include the small rear seats, limited cargo space, and potential for expensive repairs, especially as the cars age.
