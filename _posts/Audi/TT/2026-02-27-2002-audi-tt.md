### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Audi TT, while a stylish and engaging car, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and performance focus. The 1.8L turbocharged engines, particularly the 225hp variant, can experience issues with PCV valves, ignition coils, and oil leaks, which are often manageable with timely repairs. Manual transmissions are generally robust, but clutch wear is a common maintenance item. Automatic transmissions may develop fluid leak issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also known to wear. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and HVAC resistors, can occur, and the convertible top mechanism on the Roadster requires attention. Interior electronics, like the dashboard display, can also degrade. Overall, the TT is a rewarding car to own, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and factor in potential repair costs.
