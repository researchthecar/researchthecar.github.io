Alright, here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints associated with the 2007 Audi TT, broken down by category and specific configurations, adhering to your requested format.

The 2007 Audi TT is a stylish and sporty coupe and convertible, praised for its distinctive design, nimble handling, and refined interior. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common problems. The base model features a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. A more powerful 3.2L VR6 engine, rated at 250 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, was also available with the S tronic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. Some common complaints about the 2007 Audi TT include electrical problems, specifically with the convertible top, and potential issues with the dual-clutch transmission in the S tronic equipped models. Owners appreciate the TT's unique styling and engaging driving experience, but some find the rear seats cramped and the ride quality firm.
