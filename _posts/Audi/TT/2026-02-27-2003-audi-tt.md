### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Audi TT, while a stylish and enjoyable car, exhibits some common age-related issues, particularly concerning its turbocharged engines and various electrical components. Owners should be aware of potential problems like PCV valve failures, ignition coil issues, and oil leaks on the 1.8T engines. Transmission reliability is generally good for manuals, but automatics can experience TCM or torque converter issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks are also common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are not uncommon. Exterior paint and convertible top mechanisms (on roadsters) can also require attention. Despite these potential drawbacks, many issues are well-documented and repairable, making the TT a viable option for enthusiasts who are prepared for its maintenance needs.
