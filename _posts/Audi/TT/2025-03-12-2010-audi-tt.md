The 2010 Audi TT is a stylish and sporty compact car available as a coupe or roadster. The most common engine option for the 2010 Audi TT is the 2.0L turbocharged inline-4, producing 200 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 3.2L VR6 engine was also available, delivering 250 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0T engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed dual-clutch S tronic transmission, while the 3.2L VR6 came standard with the S tronic. Owners generally appreciate the TT's sharp handling, distinctive design, and premium interior. However, some dislike the limited rear seat space (in the coupe), firm ride, and potential for costly repairs.
