The 2005 Audi TT is a stylish and sporty compact car available as a coupe or roadster. For the 2005 model year, two engine options were available: a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 and a 3.2L VR6 engine. The 1.8T produces 180 horsepower and 173 lb-ft of torque in the front-wheel-drive version and 225 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque in the Quattro all-wheel-drive version. The 3.2L VR6 produces 250 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque and is exclusively available with Quattro all-wheel drive. The 1.8T engine could be paired with either a 5-speed manual (FWD), a 6-speed manual (Quattro), or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 3.2 VR6 came exclusively with a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission (DSG). Owners generally appreciate the TT's distinctive design, nimble handling, and comfortable interior. Common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with electrical components and the turbocharged engine, as well as the relatively small rear seats and limited cargo space in the coupe.
