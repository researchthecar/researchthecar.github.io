### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Audi TT is a desirable sports car with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly the VR6 engine and manual transmission. However, the more common 2.0L TFSI engine can exhibit issues like PCV valve failure and oil consumption, which require attention. The DSG transmission, while offering performance, is more prone to costly mechatronics unit and clutch pack issues than the manual. Suspension components, especially with the optional Magnetic Ride Control, can also be a source of expense. Electrical gremlins like window regulators are not uncommon for a vehicle of this age. Overall, the TT offers a compelling package, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific reliability concerns and factor in potential repair costs, especially for the powertrain and advanced suspension systems.
