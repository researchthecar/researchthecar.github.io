### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Audi TT, particularly the turbocharged models, can be a fun and stylish car, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine reliability is generally good, but the PCV system and ignition coils are known weak points. The manual transmissions are robust, while the automatic can experience TCM issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks may require attention due to age and mileage. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, are also reported. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor can fail. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, the TT requires diligent maintenance and potential owners should budget for common repairs.
