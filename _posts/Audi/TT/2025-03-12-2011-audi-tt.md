The 2011 Audi TT is a stylish and sporty coupe/roadster known for its distinctive design, nimble handling, and upscale interior. The base engine is a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4, producing 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. A higher-performance TTS model was also available, featuring a more powerful version of the 2.0L turbo engine, making 265 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque and standard quattro all-wheel drive. Owners often praise the TT for its fun-to-drive nature and refined interior but some find the rear seats cramped, the ride a bit firm, and the repair costs potentially high.

**Summary**

The 2011 Audi TT, while a desirable sports car, has some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues, primarily related to the HPFP and diverter valve, can affect performance and require moderate repair costs. The S tronic transmission can be problematic, with the mechatronic unit and clutch wear leading to potentially expensive repairs. The magnetic ride suspension (on the TTS) and electrical faults can also contribute to ownership costs. Potential buyers should factor in these repair considerations when evaluating a used 2011 Audi TT.
