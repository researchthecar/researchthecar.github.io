The 2001 Audi TT is a stylish and sporty compact car that was available as both a coupe and a roadster. The most common engine option for the 2001 Audi TT was a 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-4. This engine came in two versions: a 180 horsepower version producing 173 lb-ft of torque and a 225 horsepower version producing 207 lb-ft of torque. A less common 3.2-liter VR6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque was introduced later in the model year. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (180 hp version), a 6-speed manual (225 hp and VR6 versions), and a 6-speed automatic (offered on the 180 hp version). Owners generally appreciate the TT's distinctive design, engaging handling, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include its somewhat cramped rear seats (coupe), potential for expensive repairs, and the age-related issues common in older German cars.
