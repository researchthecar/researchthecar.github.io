### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Audi TT is a stylish and fun-to-drive car with a generally good reliability record for its age and performance focus. The turbocharged engines, while potent, can be prone to issues like PCV valve failures and ignition coil problems, which are relatively common for forced-induction engines. Transmission reliability is decent, with manual gearboxes being robust, though clutch wear is a normal maintenance item. Automatic transmissions may require attention to fluid leaks or torque converter issues. Suspension components like bushings and shocks can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and HVAC components, can also surface. For the Roadster, the convertible top mechanism is a key area to inspect. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these potential issues, the 2004 TT can remain a rewarding ownership experience.
