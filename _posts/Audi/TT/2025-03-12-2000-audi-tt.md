The 2000 Audi TT, a stylish and sporty coupe (and later roadster), marked Audi's entry into the compact sports car market. This model year primarily featured two engine options: a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 producing either 180 horsepower and 173 lb-ft of torque or 225 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque depending on the trim level. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual (180 hp) or 6-speed manual (225 hp, and some 180 hp Quattro models), and later a 6-speed automatic became available. The Quattro all-wheel-drive system was an available option, enhancing handling and traction. Drivers appreciate the TT's distinctive Bauhaus-inspired design, nimble handling, and refined interior. Common complaints often revolve around the car's limited rear seat space (in the coupe), some reliability issues, and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Summary**

The 2000 Audi TT, while a stylish and enjoyable car, is prone to certain issues typical of older European vehicles. Engine issues like MAF sensor failure and diverter valve problems are common, particularly in the turbocharged models. Transmission issues can range from clutch replacement in the manual versions to potentially costly valve body problems in the automatic. Suspension wear is also expected in a car of this age, leading to bushing and strut mount replacements. Electrical issues, especially pixel loss in the instrument cluster, are a known problem. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs, making a thorough inspection and careful maintenance crucial for prospective buyers.
