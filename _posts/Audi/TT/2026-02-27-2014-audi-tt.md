### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Audi TT, particularly with the 2.0L TFSI engine, presents a generally reliable package, but potential buyers should be aware of specific issues such as oil consumption and PCV valve failures. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission, while offering performance, has a higher likelihood of experiencing issues with its mechatronic unit and clutch packs compared to the manual gearbox. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and window regulators, are also noted. Beyond these specific points, the suspension, exterior, and interior components are typically robust. Regular maintenance and proactive checks, especially for oil levels and transmission behavior, are recommended to ensure long-term reliability.
