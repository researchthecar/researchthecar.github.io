The 2002 Audi TT is a sporty, compact coupe and roadster known for its distinctive Bauhaus-inspired styling and engaging driving dynamics. Engine options included a 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-four available in two states of tune (180 hp and 173 lb-ft of torque, or 225 hp and 207 lb-ft of torque). Transmission choices consisted of a 5-speed manual (180 hp), 6-speed manual (225 hp) and a 6-speed automatic (both hp). Many owners appreciate the TT's unique design, nimble handling, and relatively affordable price point for a European sports car. Common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs, particularly for more complex repairs, and the cramped rear seating (in the coupe version) and limited cargo space. The 225 hp version is generally more sought after for its increased power and standard Quattro all-wheel drive.

**Summary**

The 2002 Audi TT, while a stylish and fun-to-drive car, is prone to certain issues related to its age and complexity. Engine-related problems like coil pack and diverter valve failures are common, particularly on the turbocharged models, and can lead to performance issues. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic, can be costly. Suspension issues, like worn bushings, affect handling and ride quality. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster pixelation, are also frequently reported.
