The 2017 Audi TT is a stylish and sporty compact car known for its sleek design, engaging driving dynamics, and high-tech interior. The 2017 model year TT was available as a coupe or convertible (Roadster). The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The TTS variant boasts a more powerful version of the same engine, delivering 292 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque.
