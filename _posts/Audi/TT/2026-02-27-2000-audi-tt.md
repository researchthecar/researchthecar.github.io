### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Audi TT offers a unique blend of style and performance, but potential owners should be aware of common issues. The 1.8L turbocharged engines, while potent, can be susceptible to ignition coil failures and PCV system clogs. Regular maintenance, especially timely timing belt replacement, is crucial to avoid catastrophic engine damage. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, can experience clutch wear or fluid leaks/solenoid issues, respectively. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also known wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with instrument clusters and window regulators, are not uncommon. For the Roadster, convertible top mechanisms and weather stripping require attention. Interior comfort can be affected by HVAC blower motor failures and seat heater issues. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and prompt repairs, the 2000 Audi TT can remain a rewarding and stylish vehicle.
