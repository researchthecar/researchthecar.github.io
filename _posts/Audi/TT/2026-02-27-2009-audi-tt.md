### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Audi TT is a generally reliable sports car, particularly the VR6 engine variant. The more common 2.0L TFSI engine can experience issues like PCV valve failure, oil consumption, and timing chain wear, which require attention and can be costly. The DSG transmission, while offering performance, is more prone to mechatronic unit and clutch pack issues than the manual. Suspension is typically robust, though optional magnetic ride control can be expensive to repair if it fails. Electrical gremlins and convertible top issues are less common but possible. Overall, a well-maintained 2009 TT, especially with the VR6 and manual transmission, presents a good option, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific powertrain's known issues and budget for possible repairs.
