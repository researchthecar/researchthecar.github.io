**Introduction**

The 2004 Audi RS6 is a high-performance station wagon beloved by enthusiasts for its powerful V8 engine, Quattro all-wheel drive system, and luxurious interior. Under the hood, it boasts a 4.2-liter twin-turbocharged V8 that pumps out an impressive 450 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque. The RS6 was offered with a six-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic transmission.

Although the RS6 is a capable and enjoyable vehicle, it has several issues that potential owners should be aware of before making a purchase.

    * **Carbon Buildup:** The direct injection system can contribute to carbon buildup on the intake valves. This can reduce engine performance and fuel economy.
    * **Valve Spring Failure:** The valve springs can fail, leading to valve damage and engine failure.

**Transmission**

* **Six-Speed Manual Transmission:** No issues found.
* **Five-Speed Automatic Transmission:**

    * **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** The mechatronic unit, which controls the automatic transmission, can fail, resulting in shifting problems or transmission failure.
