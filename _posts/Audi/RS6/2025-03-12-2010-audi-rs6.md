**Engine**

**5.0L Twin-Turbo V10**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various points on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, oil cooler lines, and the rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. Inspect and replace damaged oil cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the V10 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, leading to reduced performance, rough idling, and misfires.
    *   Solution: Perform a carbon cleaning service, such as walnut blasting, to remove the buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

*   **Ignition Coils Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, and a check engine light are common symptoms. Often, specific cylinder misfire codes will be present.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils. It's recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time to avoid repeat failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per coil, $50 - $200 for labor.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, slipping, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, failure to shift gears, or getting stuck in a specific gear. Diagnostic codes related to the transmission control module may be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the mechatronic unit or have it rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking struts, uneven handling, and a bouncy ride. The DRC system connects the dampers diagonally, and a leak in one strut can affect the handling of the entire car.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking DRC struts. Many owners opt to replace the entire DRC system with traditional coil-over suspension for a more reliable and cost-effective solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ depending on whether individual struts are replaced or a complete conversion is performed.

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on repair versus replacement.

*   **Faulty Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights, including TPMS, ABS, and stability control. Faulty sensors can cause inaccurate readings and system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the sensor and labor.

**Exterior**
