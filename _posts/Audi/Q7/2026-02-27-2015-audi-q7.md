### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi Q7 is a generally reliable luxury SUV, particularly for those who opt for the gasoline engine and standard suspension. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, especially with the diesel engine's emissions system (DPF, EGR cooler) and the complexity of the adaptive air suspension. The gasoline V6 can experience PCV valve and supercharger belt issues. Transmission issues, while not universal, can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are also noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for mitigating these potential problems and ensuring long-term satisfaction with the vehicle.
