**Summary**

The 2013 Audi Q7 presents a range of potential issues, with engine and suspension problems being the most concerning in terms of severity and cost. The 3.0L TDI engine's HPFP failure is a significant issue. While many of the problems are relatively common, repair costs can be substantial, especially for air suspension and supercharger/turbocharger-related repairs. Electrical and interior issues, while less severe, can still be frustrating. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with Audi vehicles to identify any existing or potential problems.
