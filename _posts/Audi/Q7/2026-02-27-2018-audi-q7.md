### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Audi Q7 generally demonstrates good reliability, particularly with its transmission and standard suspension. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the engine, specifically coolant leaks and oil consumption in the 2.0L TFSI, and PCV valve/water pump issues in the 3.0L TFSI. Vehicles equipped with the optional Adaptive Air Suspension may encounter leaks or compressor failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, primarily software-related glitches in the infotainment system and occasional battery drain issues, are also noted. Despite these potential concerns, the Q7 remains a solid choice for a luxury SUV, with most issues being repairable and not indicative of systemic failure across the model range.
