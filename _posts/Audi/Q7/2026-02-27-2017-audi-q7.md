### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Audi Q7 demonstrates a generally good reliability record, especially considering its luxury segment and advanced features. The powertrain options, particularly the 3.0L V6, have some documented issues like PCV valve and water pump failures, which are not uncommon for supercharged engines. The 2.0L turbo can experience oil consumption. The adaptive air suspension is a notable area for potential costly repairs, with leaks and compressor failures being the primary concerns. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, can also occur. While not immune to problems, most issues are repairable, and proactive maintenance, especially fluid changes and system checks, can mitigate some risks. Overall, it offers a compelling package for those seeking a refined and capable large SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific reliability points.
