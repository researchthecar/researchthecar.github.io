### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Audi Q7 presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline V6 and V8 engines can be prone to issues like PCV valve failure, ignition coil problems, and, in the case of the V8, more serious timing chain and oil consumption concerns. The diesel engine, while offering better fuel economy, can suffer from DPF and EGR valve issues. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic, often involve leaks and torque converter issues. The adaptive air suspension is a notable area for potential costly repairs due to leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MMI infotainment system, are also reported. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be aware of these specific mechanical and electrical vulnerabilities, especially those related to the powertrain and air suspension, which can lead to significant repair costs.
