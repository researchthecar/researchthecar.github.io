**Summary**
The 2015 Audi Q7 is a capable and comfortable luxury SUV, but it is not without its issues. The most serious problems involve the engine, specifically the timing chain tensioner failure on the 3.6L V6 and the carbon buildup on intake valves on the 3.0L V6. Other issues, such as suspension malfunction and electrical connection problems, can be costly to repair as well. While these issues can be significant, it is important to note that not all Q7s experience them, and their severity and cost can vary depending on the specific problem and the extent of the repairs needed.
