### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Audi Q7, while a luxurious and capable SUV, presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline engines, particularly the 3.0L TFSI, have reported issues with the PCV valve and supercharger belt. The diesel variant is more prone to DPF and EGR system problems, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the mechatronics unit and torque converter on the 8-speed automatic, are a significant concern. The adaptive air suspension is a notable weak point, with leaks and compressor failures being common. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the MMI infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, also require attention. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, the climate control system's blend door actuators can fail. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs, especially concerning the powertrain and suspension, and factor in the higher cost of parts and labor associated with premium European vehicles.
