### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Audi Q7 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its exterior and interior components, where no widespread issues are commonly reported. The powertrain, while generally robust, can present some concerns. The 2.0L TFSI engine may experience coolant leaks or turbocharger issues, while the 3.0L TFSI V6 can be susceptible to PCV valve or water pump problems. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting or mechatronics unit failure, are noted but not universal. The adaptive air suspension, a premium feature, has a higher likelihood of developing leaks or sensor issues compared to the standard coil spring setup. Electrical gremlins, primarily software-related in the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also documented. Owners should be aware of these potential areas and ensure regular maintenance, especially for the air suspension and powertrain components, to maintain optimal performance and longevity.
