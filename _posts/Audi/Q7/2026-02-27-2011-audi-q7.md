### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Audi Q7 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core structure and many components are robust, specific issues are noted, particularly with the gasoline engines (timing chain and PCV valve on the 3.0T, timing chain on the 3.6L) and the diesel engine (DPF and EGR cooler). The automatic transmission can experience leaks and torque converter problems. The optional air suspension is prone to leaks and compressor failures, making the standard suspension a more reliable choice. Electrical gremlins, especially with the MMI system and parasitic battery drain, can also occur. Interior components like HVAC blend doors are a known weak point. Owners should be aware of these potential costly repairs, especially concerning the powertrain and air suspension systems.
