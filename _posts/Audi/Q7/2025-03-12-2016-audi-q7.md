Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2016 Audi Q7, categorized by component. The 2016 Audi Q7 marked the beginning of the second generation, offering a more luxurious and technologically advanced experience than its predecessor. Engine options included a 3.0L Supercharged V6 producing 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L TDI diesel engine which produced 272 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Q7's spacious and well-appointed interior, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. However, some common complaints include electronic glitches, higher maintenance costs, and some reliability concerns, particularly with early model year versions.

**Engine**

**3.0L Supercharged V6 (TFSI)**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can originate from various locations including the water pump, thermostat housing, or coolant hoses. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty component (water pump, thermostat, hose, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+, depending on the source of the leak and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Supercharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Supercharger failure can manifest as a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or rattling) from the engine, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L TDI (Diesel)**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF clogging or failure can result in reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, a warning light, and potentially limp mode.
    *   Solution: DPF regeneration (if possible), cleaning, or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+, depending on the severity and required repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **AdBlue System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AdBlue (diesel exhaust fluid) system can experience failures with the pump, sensor, or injector. Symptoms include warning lights, error messages related to emissions, and potentially limp mode.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the faulty component (pump, sensor, injector, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. There may also be hesitation upon acceleration.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission adaptation reset, check the transmission fluid level and condition, or potentially replace the valve body. In some cases, a full transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (adaptation) - $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The optional air suspension can experience problems with the air struts, compressor, or air lines. Symptoms include the vehicle sitting unevenly, failing to raise or lower, or an error message related to the suspension system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component failure and replace the affected part (air strut, compressor, air line, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ per air strut, $800-$1500+ for the compressor, depending on the specific component and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system can experience glitches, including freezing, crashing, slow response times, or display issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates, MMI control unit replacement (in severe cases).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $1500+ (MMI control unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A variety of sensors can malfunction, including parking sensors, blind spot monitoring sensors, and adaptive cruise control sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty sensor.
