### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi Q7, while offering a premium experience, presents several potential reliability concerns, particularly with its more complex systems. The gasoline engines, especially the 3.0L TFSI, can experience issues with the PCV valve and supercharger belt. Diesel variants are more prone to DPF and EGR problems. The automatic transmission's mechatronics unit and torque converter are notable weak points. The optional adaptive air suspension is a significant area for potential costly repairs due to leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MMI infotainment system, can also arise. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, specific components like climate control blend doors can fail. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs, especially if opting for the advanced suspension or diesel powertrains.
