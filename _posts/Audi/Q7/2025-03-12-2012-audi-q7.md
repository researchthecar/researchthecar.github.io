The 2012 Audi Q7 is a luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available technology. It was offered with three engine options: a 3.0L supercharged V6 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a higher-output 3.0L supercharged V6 (333 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L TDI diesel V6 (225 hp, 406 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Q7's luxurious feel, ample cargo space, and confident handling. Common complaints include relatively high running costs, potential for expensive repairs, and somewhat dated infotainment system.

Engine problems, particularly with the timing chain tensioners and water pump in the supercharged V6 models, can lead to expensive repairs. Transmission issues like valve body failure are also a concern. The air suspension (if equipped) can be problematic and costly to maintain. Electrical gremlins, though less frequent, can be difficult to diagnose.
