### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Audi Q7 presents a generally reliable profile for a luxury SUV of its era, with most reported issues being manageable and not indicative of systemic failure. The gasoline V6 and V8 engines are relatively robust, though the supercharged V6 can experience PCV valve issues. The diesel V6 TDI is more prone to emissions-related problems like DPF and EGR issues, which can be costly to repair. Transmission reliability is generally good, but mechatronic unit and torque converter issues can arise, especially with higher mileage. The adaptive air suspension is a common source of repair, with leaks and compressor failures being the most frequent complaints. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the MMI system, are also noted. Owners should be prepared for potential costs associated with these specific components, especially if opting for a diesel model or one equipped with air suspension. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for longevity.
