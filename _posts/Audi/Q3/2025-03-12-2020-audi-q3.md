**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (228 hp, 258 lb-ft)**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points in the cooling system, leading to low coolant levels, overheating, and potential engine damage. Specific areas prone to leaks include the water pump, thermostat housing, and coolant hoses. Visual inspection may reveal coolant puddles under the vehicle or visible residue around these components. Overheating and warning lights on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking component is the primary solution. This could involve replacing the water pump, thermostat housing, hoses, or other related parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets in the engine, leading to oil consumption and potential engine damage. Common leak locations include the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Visual inspection may reveal oil puddles under the vehicle or oil residue on the engine components. Low oil pressure can trigger a warning light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking seals and gaskets is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds or during acceleration. The transmission may also exhibit hesitation or delays when shifting. This is often attributed to the transmission's adaptive learning system or issues with the valve body.
    *   Solution: A transmission software update or adaptation reset may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (software update), $800 - $2000+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of transmission slippage, particularly during acceleration or when climbing hills. The engine may rev higher than usual without a corresponding increase in speed. The transmission may also exhibit hesitation or delays when shifting. This can be caused by low transmission fluid or internal wear.
    * Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and top it off if necessary. If the problem persists, a transmission flush may be helpful. In severe cases, transmission repair or replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $75-$150 (fluid check/top-off), $200-$400 (flush), $3000+ (repair/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners may experience clunking, rattling, or squeaking noises emanating from the suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. Common causes include worn sway bar links, control arm bushings, or strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**
