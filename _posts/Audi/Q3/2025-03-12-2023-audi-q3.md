Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2023 Audi Q3, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options where applicable.

The 2023 Audi Q3 is a subcompact luxury SUV known for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving dynamics. Engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing either 184 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque (40 TFSI) or 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque (45 TFSI).

**Summary**

The 2023 Audi Q3, while a desirable luxury subcompact SUV, has some reported issues. While some problems are minor and easily fixed, others, like oil consumption or turbocharger failure, can be more serious and costly. Electrical glitches in the infotainment system can also be frustrating. While issues like rattling are more of a nuisance than a critical problem, it is good to check the car over before purchasing. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle (or have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic) before making a purchase.
