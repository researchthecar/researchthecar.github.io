**Introduction:**

The 2023 Audi Q3 is a compact luxury SUV that offers a potent blend of performance, comfort, and convenience. It is available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 201 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-five producing 295 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and standard Quattro all-wheel drive. The Q3 has received praise for its agile handling, premium features, and spacious interior, but it has also been criticized for its firm ride and limited cargo space.
