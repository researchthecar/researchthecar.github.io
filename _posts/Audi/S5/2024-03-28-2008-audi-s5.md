**Summary**

The 2008 Audi S5 is a desirable car with a powerful engine and excellent driving dynamics. However, it is not without its issues. The engine can suffer from oil consumption, timing chain tensioner failure, valve stem seal failure, and carbon buildup on the intake valves. The transmission may experience gear grinding (manual), shift flare, and torque converter shudder (automatic). Other potential problems include front suspension strut mount failure, electrical issues with the xenon headlamps and Bose audio system, and sunroof motor failure. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are generally not common and should not deter potential buyers from considering this stylish and powerful sports coupe.
