The 2017 Audi S5 is a performance-oriented coupe, sedan (Sportback), and convertible (Cabriolet) that blends luxury with sporty driving dynamics. The heart of the 2017 S5 is a 3.0-liter TFSI turbocharged V6 engine producing 354 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission and quattro all-wheel drive as standard. People often praise the S5 for its sleek design, comfortable interior, strong acceleration, and confident handling. Common complaints often involve higher maintenance costs, complex electronics prone to glitches, and the firm ride quality that can be fatiguing on rough roads.

**Engine**

**3.0-liter TFSI V6**

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various locations within the cooling system, including the water pump, thermostat housing, and coolant hoses. Symptoms include a low coolant warning light, visible coolant puddles under the vehicle, and overheating.
    * Solution: Locate and repair the source of the leak. This may involve replacing faulty hoses, gaskets, or the water pump itself. A pressure test can help pinpoint the leak.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the source and complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can stem from the valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, or timing chain cover. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil spots on the ground, and a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty gasket or seal. This often involves removing other engine components for access.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+ depending on the location and extent of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Tiptronic Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or jerky shifts, particularly when the transmission is cold or under heavy acceleration.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush may help, but in some cases, valve body repair or replacement might be necessary. Software updates can sometimes address shifting issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $2000+ (valve body repair/replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hesitation or Delay in Engagement**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse can occur, along with hesitation during acceleration.
    * Solution: Diagnosis should include checking the transmission fluid level and condition. Addressing low fluid levels can resolve the issue. Additionally, inspecting the mechatronic unit and valve body for wear or damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $2500+ (mechatronic unit/valve body repair or replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Adaptive Damper Malfunctions (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicles equipped with the adaptive damping system may experience issues with individual dampers failing or becoming unresponsive. This can lead to uneven ride quality, knocking noises, and error messages on the instrument cluster.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty damper and replace it. The control module for the system may also need to be checked and reprogrammed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per damper, plus diagnostic fees.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system can experience glitches such as freezing, lagging, and random reboots. Connectivity issues with smartphones and other devices are also common.
    * Solution: Software updates can often resolve these issues. In some cases, the MMI control unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1000+ (MMI unit replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors and blind spot monitoring systems can malfunction, providing false alerts or failing to detect obstacles.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor(s) and replace them. The wiring harness may also need to be checked for damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, make unusual noises, or leak water.
    * Solution: Inspect and clean the sunroof tracks and drains. Repair or replace damaged components such as the motor or seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters may fail to heat or heat unevenly.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty heating element or control module and replace it. Check the wiring harness for damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $700+ per seat.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Audi S5 is a desirable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The engine and transmission, while powerful and refined, can be prone to leaks and shifting problems, potentially leading to costly repairs. Electrical glitches and sensor failures are also relatively common. Suspension issues with the adaptive dampers can further add to the maintenance burden. While the severity of these issues varies, the potential repair costs can be significant, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential.
