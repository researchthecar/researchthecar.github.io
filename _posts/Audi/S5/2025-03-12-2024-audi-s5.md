The 2024 Audi S5 is a stylish and sporty coupe, sportback, and convertible powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine producing 349 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. All models are equipped with an eight-speed automatic transmission and Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system. Drivers generally appreciate the S5's sharp handling, comfortable interior, and refined powertrain. Some common complaints include the relatively high price point, the sometimes-hesitant throttle response in lower gears, and the limited rear seat space in the coupe.
