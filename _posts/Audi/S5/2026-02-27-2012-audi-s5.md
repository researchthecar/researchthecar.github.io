### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi S5 is a desirable performance coupe with a generally solid build. However, potential buyers should be aware of specific powertrain concerns, particularly with the V8 engine's timing chain tensioners and the S tronic transmission's mechatronic unit. The supercharged V6 is generally more reliable but can suffer from PCV valve issues. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, are also a possibility. Regular maintenance and pre-purchase inspections are crucial for mitigating these potential reliability concerns and ensuring a positive ownership experience.
