The 2014 Audi S5 is a performance-oriented luxury coupe, convertible, and sedan that offers a blend of style, performance, and technology. The most common engine option is the supercharged 3.0-liter V6, producing 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. A less common option is the 4.2-liter V8, producing 354 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a 6-speed manual, 7-speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic, or an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners often praise the S5 for its powerful engine, sleek design, and comfortable interior, but some common complaints include issues with the timing chain tensioners, carbon buildup, and the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**3.0L Supercharged V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon startup, especially after the car has been sitting for a while. This can lead to catastrophic engine failure if the tensioners fail completely, causing the timing chain to skip.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioners, guides, and possibly the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased performance, misfires, and poor fuel economy. This is due to the direct injection design, where fuel is injected directly into the cylinders and doesn't wash the intake valves.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves or walnut blasting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Supercharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the supercharger, loss of power, and potential error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the supercharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.2L V8**
* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be visible.
    * Solution: In some cases, replacing valve stem seals or piston rings may reduce oil consumption, but it can be an expensive and complex repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S-Tronic Dual-Clutch Automatic Transmission**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, erratic gear changes, and potential error codes related to the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps, imprecise steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation malfunctions with the MMI (Multi Media Interface) system.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the MMI control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Electrical Power Steering Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power steering assist, warning lights on the dashboard. This can make the car difficult to steer, especially at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power steering motor or the entire steering rack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof getting stuck, not opening or closing properly, or making excessive noise during operation. This can be due to debris in the tracks, a faulty motor, or broken components.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks, repairing or replacing the sunroof motor, or replacing broken components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light Illumination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light on the dashboard is illuminated, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the issue with an OBD-II scanner, and repairing or replacing faulty components such as the clock spring, seat occupancy sensor, or airbag module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the issue

**Summary**

The 2014 Audi S5, while a desirable performance vehicle, has its share of common issues. The most concerning are related to the engine, specifically the timing chain tensioner issues in the 3.0L V6 and the oil consumption issues in the 4.2L V8, as these can lead to costly repairs. Carbon buildup is also prevalent in direct-injected engines and requires periodic cleaning. Electrical issues related to the infotainment system and the power steering can also be frustrating. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the cost of maintenance and repairs when considering purchasing a 2014 Audi S5.
