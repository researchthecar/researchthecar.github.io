The 2023 Audi S5 is a performance-oriented luxury coupe, sedan (Sportback), and convertible (Cabriolet) known for its blend of style, technology, and driving dynamics. It comes standard with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine producing 349 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The S5 is praised for its sleek design, comfortable and well-appointed interior, responsive handling, and standard quattro all-wheel drive. Criticisms often include a relatively firm ride, limited rear-seat space in the coupe and convertible, and some find the infotainment system can be distracting.
