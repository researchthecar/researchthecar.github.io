Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2011 Audi S5, categorized by component, and separated by engine and transmission where applicable.

The 2011 Audi S5 is a performance-oriented coupe and cabriolet. It was offered with two primary engine options: a 4.2-liter V8 producing 354 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter Supercharged V6 producing 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. The 4.2L was generally favored for its distinctive V8 sound and more linear power delivery, while the 3.0L offered better fuel economy. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual (V8 only), a 6-speed Tiptronic automatic (V8 only), and a 7-speed S-tronic dual-clutch transmission (3.0T only). Owners often appreciate the S5's stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and luxurious interior. Common dislikes include higher maintenance costs, potential reliability issues, and sometimes cramped rear seating (especially in the coupe).
