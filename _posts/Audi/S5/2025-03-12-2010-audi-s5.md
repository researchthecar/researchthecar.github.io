The 2010 Audi S5 is a performance-oriented coupe or cabriolet that offered drivers a blend of luxury and sporty handling. The most desirable configuration features a 4.2-liter V8 engine producing 354 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners love the distinctive styling, the comfortable and well-appointed interior, and the throaty exhaust note of the V8 engine. Dislikes often center around the car's reliability, relatively high maintenance costs, and the complexity of its systems, which can lead to expensive repairs. While a smaller 3.0-liter Supercharged V6 engine with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission was available, the 4.2L V8 with manual or automatic transmission is a more common configuration.

**Engine**

**4.2L V8**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise, especially on cold start-up. Can lead to catastrophic engine damage if the tensioner fails completely and the timing chain jumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioners, chains, guides, and associated hardware.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and reduced performance. Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel being sprayed to clean the valves.
    *   Solution: Manually clean the carbon buildup from the intake valves using walnut blasting or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, transmission slipping, or inability to shift into certain gears. Can be triggered by something as simple as a faulty speed sensor.
    * Solution: Replace or rebuild the mechatronic unit. A software update could also be needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision and uneven tire wear.

**Summary**

The 2010 Audi S5, particularly with the 4.2L V8 engine, is prone to some potentially expensive issues. Timing chain tensioner failure and carbon buildup are significant concerns on the engine front, requiring specialized attention and potentially high repair costs. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can also be costly. Suspension and electrical issues contribute to the overall maintenance burden.
