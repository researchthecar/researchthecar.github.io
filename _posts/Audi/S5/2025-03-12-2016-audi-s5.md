The 2016 Audi S5 is a performance-oriented coupe, cabriolet (convertible), and sportback (4-door coupe) known for its stylish design and engaging driving experience. All 2016 S5 models are equipped with a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 engine producing 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. This engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the S5's quick acceleration, sharp handling, and upscale interior. However, some common complaints include higher than average repair costs, particularly concerning the dual-clutch transmission, and occasional electrical gremlins. Some also find the ride a bit firm for daily driving.
