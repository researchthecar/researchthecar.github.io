The 2018 Audi S5 is a performance-oriented coupe, sportback, or convertible that offers a blend of luxury and driving enjoyment. It's powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine that produces 354 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking from the thermostat housing or water pump area. This can cause the engine to overheat, potentially leading to serious damage. Visible coolant puddles under the car are common, along with a low coolant level warning on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the thermostat housing and/or water pump, including seals and gaskets. Pressure testing the cooling system after repair is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, timing chain cover, or rear main seal. Burning oil smell, visible oil leaks on the engine or ground, and low oil level warnings are typical symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. In more severe cases, the entire valve cover or timing chain cover may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on location and severity.

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifts, delayed engagement of gears, or a noticeable "clunk" when shifting. This can be more pronounced during cold starts or at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and adaptation reset can improve shifting. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or, in rare cases, a full transmission replacement.

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system freezing, becoming unresponsive, or restarting unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
