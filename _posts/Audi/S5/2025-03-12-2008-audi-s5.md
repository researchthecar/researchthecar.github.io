The 2008 Audi S5 is a performance coupe and cabriolet known for its stylish design, luxurious interior, and engaging driving experience. The primary engine option for the 2008 S5 was a 4.2-liter V8 engine producing 354 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. While many appreciate the S5's aesthetics and handling, common criticisms often involve maintenance costs and the potential for mechanical issues.
