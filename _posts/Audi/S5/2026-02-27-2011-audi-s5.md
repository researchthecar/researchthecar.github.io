### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Audi S5, particularly with the V8 engine, is known for its engaging driving experience but can present some significant repair costs, especially concerning timing chain components. The V6 variant generally offers better reliability in the engine department but can still encounter issues like supercharger belt or PCV valve problems. Transmission reliability is generally good, though automatic transmissions can develop issues with the torque converter or mechatronic unit. Suspension components like control arm bushings are wear items that may need replacement. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are not uncommon. Overall, while a desirable performance car, potential buyers should be aware of the possibility of costly repairs, especially related to the engine and transmission.
