### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi S5 demonstrates a solid reliability record, particularly concerning its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The 3.0L supercharged V6 is generally robust, though common issues like PCV valve failures and occasional oil leaks from valve cover gaskets are noted. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission, while offering excellent performance, can be susceptible to mechatronic unit issues and fluid leaks, making regular fluid changes crucial. Manual transmissions are typically more straightforward but clutch wear is a standard maintenance consideration. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, can occur but are often resolvable with software updates. Overall, the S5 is a reliable performance car, but owners should be prepared for potential costs associated with its performance-oriented nature and advanced technology.
