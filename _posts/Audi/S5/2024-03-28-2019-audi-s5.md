**Introduction:**
The 2019 Audi S5 is a performance-oriented coupe that combines a luxurious interior with a powerful engine. It features a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine producing 349 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The S5 is praised for its sleek design, spacious cabin, and impressive handling, but some owners have reported issues with certain components.

**Engine**
* **3.0L Turbocharged V6**
    * **Intake Valve Carbon Buildup:** Carbon deposits accumulate on the intake valves, reducing engine performance and causing rough idling, hesitation, and decreased fuel efficiency. Solution: Clean the intake valves using walnut blasting or other methods. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner may fail, causing a rattling noise, rough running, and potential engine damage. Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    * **PCM Software Update:** The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) software may need to be updated to address engine performance issues, such as poor fuel economy or sluggish acceleration. Solution: Update the PCM software at an authorized Audi dealer. Estimated Cost to Fix: Free under warranty, otherwise ~$200+
    * **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure:** The high-pressure fuel pump may fail, causing loss of engine power, rough idling, and difficulty starting. Solution: Replace the high-pressure fuel pump. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
    * **Turbocharger Boost Pressure Sensor Failure:** The turbocharger boost pressure sensor may fail, resulting in reduced engine power and turbo lag. Solution: Replace the boost pressure sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Transmission**
* **8-Speed Automatic**
    * **Shifting Hesitations:** The transmission may hesitate or jerk during gear changes, especially when shifting from low to second gear. Solution: Update the transmission software or replace the transmission control module. Estimated Cost to Fix: Free under warranty, otherwise ~$500+
    * **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** The mechatronic unit, which controls the transmission, may fail, causing transmission problems, such as slipping gears, harsh shifting, or loss of power. Solution: Replace the mechatronic unit. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
