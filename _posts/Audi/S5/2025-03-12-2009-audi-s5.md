The 2009 Audi S5 is a performance-oriented coupe and cabriolet that offers a blend of luxury and sporty driving dynamics. The most sought-after engine option for this year is the 4.2-liter V8 engine producing 354 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. However, it was also available with a 3.0-liter supercharged V6, which was introduced later in the model year. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed Tiptronic automatic. Many owners appreciate the S5's stylish design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience. Common complaints include the high cost of maintenance and repairs, and the V8 engine's potential for carbon buildup and timing chain issues.

**Engine**

**4.2L V8**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 4.2L V8 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased performance, misfires, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: A manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) is the most common solution. Chemical cleaning methods are also available but may not be as effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioners on the 4.2L V8 can fail, leading to timing chain rattle, especially on startup. If left unaddressed, this can cause severe engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioners, chains, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 4.2L V8 engines experience excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the PCV valve can help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for PCV valve, $5000+ for piston ring replacement.
