The 2014 Audi TT RS Quattro is a performance-oriented coupe celebrated for its unique engine and engaging driving dynamics. It came equipped with a turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-5 engine producing 360 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission option offered was a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the TT RS for its powerful engine, sharp handling, distinctive styling, and standard all-wheel-drive. Some common complaints include a firm ride (especially on rough roads), limited rear passenger space (it's essentially a 2+2), and some maintenance costs associated with a performance vehicle.
