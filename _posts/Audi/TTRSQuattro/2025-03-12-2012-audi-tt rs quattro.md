The 2012 Audi TT RS Quattro is a high-performance sports coupe known for its distinctive styling and potent powertrain. This particular model was only offered with a 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-5 engine producing 360 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 6-speed manual transmission, and Audi's Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Owners often praise its engaging driving dynamics, distinctive engine note, and timeless design. However, some common complaints include a firm ride, limited rear seat space, and relatively high running costs due to its performance-oriented nature.

**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Inline-5**

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, hesitation during acceleration, and potentially a check engine light. The factory diverter valve can fail prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replace the diverter valve with an updated OEM version or an aftermarket performance diverter valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. In some cases, a PCV valve replacement may help. Severe cases may require further investigation and potentially engine repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light are common symptoms of failing ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It's often recommended to replace all coils at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage during acceleration, particularly in higher gears. This is more common in vehicles that have been modified or driven aggressively.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **MagRide Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TT RS uses Audi's Magnetic Ride (MagRide) suspension system. The dampers can fail, resulting in a loss of damping control, a bouncy ride, and potentially a warning light on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty MagRide damper(s). This is a relatively expensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises from the suspension, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery drains quickly, especially if left sitting for a few days.
    * Solution: Check all the electrical components and make sure they are not drawing power while the car is off. Replace the battery if its old or tests weak.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixelation/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Certain sections of the instrument cluster display may lose pixels or fail completely, making it difficult to read information.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Spoiler Delamination (Rare)**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory navigation system can experience software glitches, slow performance, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Attempt a software update. If that doesn't work, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Audi TT RS Quattro is a desirable sports car, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine-related problems like diverter valve failure and oil consumption can occur, while the suspension's MagRide dampers can be costly to replace. Electrical issues like battery drain and instrument cluster failures are also reported. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them can require a significant investment. A thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
