### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi TT RS Quattro offers a compelling blend of performance and style. While the 2.5L turbocharged engine is a strong performer, potential owners should be aware of possible PCV valve failures and oil consumption issues, which can be costly to repair. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission, while quick-shifting, has documented issues with its mechatronic unit and clutch packs, representing significant potential repair expenses. The manual transmission variant appears to be more robust. Beyond these powertrain concerns, the TT RS generally exhibits good reliability in its suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components, with no widespread systemic failures reported in these areas. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any emerging symptoms are crucial for maintaining the reliability of this performance car.
