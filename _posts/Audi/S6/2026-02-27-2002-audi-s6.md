### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Audi S6 is a capable performance sedan, but its age means potential for specific issues. The 4.2L V8 engine, while powerful, is prone to timing chain tensioner wear, which can be a costly repair if neglected. Automatic transmission issues, particularly with the 5HP24, can manifest as harsh shifting. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also common wear items. Electrically, window regulators and HVAC resistors are known to fail. Interior issues like headliner sagging and MFD pixelation are cosmetic but can detract from the premium feel. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and addressing these common problems, the 2002 S6 can remain a rewarding vehicle to own.
