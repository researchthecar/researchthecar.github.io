### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Audi S6 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential buyers and owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The powerful 4.0L twin-turbo V8 engine, while potent, can be prone to issues like PCV valve failure and increased oil consumption, which may require significant repair costs. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission can also experience problems with its mechatronics unit or clutch packs. For models equipped with the adaptive air suspension, leaks in the struts or compressor failure are notable potential expenses. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the MMI infotainment system, and interior components like climate control actuators and seat heaters are also areas to monitor. Despite these potential issues, many owners report satisfaction with the vehicle's performance and overall driving experience when these problems are addressed.
