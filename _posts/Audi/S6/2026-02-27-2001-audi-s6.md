### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Audi S6, while offering strong performance, presents several potential reliability concerns typical of German luxury vehicles of this era. The 4.2L V8 engine's timing chain tensioners are a significant known issue that can lead to severe engine damage if not addressed proactively. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can also be costly. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and climate control problems, are not uncommon. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks will likely require attention on higher-mileage examples. Interior wear, especially the pixelated displays and sagging headliners, are cosmetic but can detract from the experience. Despite these potential drawbacks, a well-maintained S6 can still be a rewarding car, but prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially high repair costs and prioritize thorough pre-purchase inspections.
