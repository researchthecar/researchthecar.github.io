# 2004 Audi S6

### Overview
The 2004 Audi S6, a performance-oriented variant of the A6, was equipped with a potent 4.2-liter V8 engine. While generally considered a robust vehicle for its era, like any performance car, it has specific areas that may require attention. This analysis focuses on documented technical reliability issues beyond routine maintenance. Owners often praise its comfortable ride and powerful acceleration, but potential buyers should be aware of common concerns related to the powertrain, particularly the timing chain system, and some electrical components. The Quattro all-wheel-drive system is a strong point, contributing to its handling capabilities. Overall, the S6 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but diligent maintenance and awareness of potential weak spots are key to long-term ownership satisfaction.

### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Audi S6 is a capable performance sedan with a powerful V8 engine. Its primary reliability concerns revolve around the engine's timing chain system, which can be an expensive repair if neglected. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter and valve body, are also noted. Owners opting for the optional air suspension should be prepared for potential leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and infotainment glitches, can occur. Interior components like the headliner and dashboard display are also known to degrade over time. Despite these potential issues, with proactive maintenance and addressing problems promptly, the 2004 S6 can remain a rewarding vehicle to own.
