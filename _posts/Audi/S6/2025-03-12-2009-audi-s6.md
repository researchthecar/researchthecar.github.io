*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Higher than normal oil consumption is frequently reported. Symptoms include the need to add oil more frequently than expected, low oil level warnings, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust. This is often noticed at higher mileages.
    *   Solution: Addressing this can range from replacing the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) valve, inspecting valve stem seals and piston rings, or in severe cases, an engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (PCV valve) - $5000+ (Engine Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the V10 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves. Symptoms include rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, decreased fuel economy, and misfires.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves or walnut blasting to remove carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
