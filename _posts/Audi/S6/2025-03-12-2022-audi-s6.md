**Summary**

The 2022 Audi S6, while a performance-oriented luxury sedan, is not immune to common issues. Engine problems such as turbocharger and coolant leaks are possible. Transmission issues such as rough shifting are possible. Furthermore, there are possible issues with the air suspension, infotainment system, sensors, and sunroof. While some of these issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, particularly if they involve major components like the turbochargers, air suspension, or transmission. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
