### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Audi S6 offers a compelling blend of luxury and V10 performance. However, its high-performance nature and advanced technology can lead to specific reliability concerns. The 5.2L V10 engine is prone to carbon buildup, oil consumption, and potentially costly timing chain issues. The adaptive air suspension can develop leaks or compressor problems, and the transmission may experience torque converter or valve body issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the MMI system and lighting, are also noted. While the exterior is generally robust, interior components like climate control actuators and seat motors can fail. Prospective buyers should budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the engine and suspension, and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspection.
