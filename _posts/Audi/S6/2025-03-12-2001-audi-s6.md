*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt can fail if not replaced at the recommended interval (typically 75,000 - 90,000 miles). Failure can cause catastrophic engine damage as the V8 is an interference engine. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, and eventually complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, water pump, tensioner, and related components at the recommended interval. Repairing an engine damaged by timing belt failure often requires extensive work or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (depending on severity of damage).
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common areas for oil leaks include valve cover gaskets, camshaft seals, and the rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals.

**Summary**

The 2001 Audi S6, while a desirable performance sedan, is subject to a variety of issues related to its age and complexity. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine, particularly the timing belt and potential oil leaks. The air suspension also requires attention and can be costly to maintain. Electrical issues, such as pixel loss in the instrument cluster, are also common. Potential buyers should budget for higher maintenance costs and be prepared for repairs associated with these common issues. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work.
