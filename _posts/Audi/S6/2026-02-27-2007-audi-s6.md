### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Audi S6, while offering a thrilling driving experience thanks to its V10 engine, presents a mixed reliability profile. The primary concerns revolve around the engine, particularly carbon buildup, oil consumption, and the potential for timing chain issues, which can be costly to address. The automatic transmission can also experience issues with the torque converter and mechatronic unit. The adaptive air suspension is another area prone to problems like leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MMI system and parking sensors, are also noted. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, the significant potential for expensive repairs in the powertrain and suspension means that prospective buyers should budget for maintenance and be prepared for potential issues.
