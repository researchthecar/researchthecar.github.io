The 2015 Audi S6 is a performance-oriented sedan that blends luxury with spirited driving dynamics. Powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 420 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque, it comes standard with a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. The S6 is praised for its powerful engine, comfortable interior, and quattro all-wheel-drive system. However, some owners have reported issues related to oil consumption, drivetrain malfunctions, and electrical gremlins. There were no other engine or transmission options available for the 2015 Audi S6.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported the 4.0T engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, sometimes requiring a quart every 1,000 miles or less. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, the need to frequently add oil, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Some have had success with software updates that alter the oil consumption, while others have had to replace the piston rings. A leakdown test can help determine if the rings are the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the turbochargers can occur. Symptoms include loss of power, unusual noises (whining or screeching) from the engine, and potential check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ per turbocharger.

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit, which controls the transmission's shifting, can fail. Symptoms include rough or delayed shifting, transmission slipping, inability to shift, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the mechatronic unit or, in some cases, the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can develop leaks in the air struts, air lines, or the compressor itself. Symptoms include the car sitting unevenly, the suspension not adjusting properly, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air strut, air line repair, or replacement of the air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ per strut; $500 - $1,500 for compressor replacement.

**Summary**

The 2015 Audi S6, while offering a compelling blend of performance and luxury, can present owners with notable issues. Engine problems, particularly excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failures, can be quite costly to address. Transmission issues relating to the Mechatronic unit can also be expensive. Air suspension problems and electrical gremlins add to the potential ownership costs. Addressing these common problems can lead to repair bills ranging from a few hundred to several thousands of dollars, depending on the severity and specific issue. Buyers should carefully inspect potential vehicles and review maintenance records to assess the risk of encountering these problems.
