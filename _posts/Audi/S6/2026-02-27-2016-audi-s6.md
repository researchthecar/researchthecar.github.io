### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Audi S6, while a compelling performance sedan, presents a few key areas where owners may encounter issues. The 4.0L twin-turbo V8, though powerful, can be susceptible to PCV valve failures and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to repair. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission, while offering rapid shifts, has documented issues with its mechatronics unit and clutch packs. The optional adaptive air suspension is another area to monitor, with potential for leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and LED lighting, can also arise. Despite these potential concerns, many owners report a positive ownership experience, especially if maintenance is kept up to date and potential issues are addressed promptly. The standard sport suspension appears to be more robust.
