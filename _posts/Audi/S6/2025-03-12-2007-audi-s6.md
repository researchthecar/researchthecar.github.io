The 2007 Audi S6 is a high-performance sedan featuring a naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V10 engine producing 435 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque. It came standard with a six-speed automatic transmission sending power to all four wheels through Audi's Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Owners generally appreciate the S6 for its unique engine, luxurious interior, and overall performance capabilities. However, some common dislikes include high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and potential reliability issues associated with the V10 engine.

**Engine**

**5.2L V10**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines, such as the V10 in the S6, are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves. This buildup restricts airflow, leading to reduced power, poor fuel economy, rough idling, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: A manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) is the most effective solution. Chemical treatments are also available but may not be as thorough.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The V10 engine is known to develop oil leaks from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, and oil cooler lines. These leaks can cause oil consumption, low oil pressure, and potential damage to other engine components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioners on the V10 engine can fail, leading to timing chain rattle, misfires, and potentially catastrophic engine damage if the timing chain jumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioners and potentially the timing chains themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, causing shuddering, slipping, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit (the transmission control unit) can fail, leading to harsh shifting, delayed engagement, and error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing or reprogramming the Mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can develop leaks in the air struts, compressor failure, or issues with the ride height sensors. This results in a sagging suspension, uneven ride height, and a malfunctioning air suspension system warning light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts, compressor, or ride height sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per strut, $500 - $1500 for the compressor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixelation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LCD screen in the instrument cluster can develop pixelation or become unreadable, especially in hot or cold weather.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Parking Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The parking sensors can fail, causing inaccurate readings or a complete system failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty parking sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric can detach from the backing board, causing it to sag.
    *   Solution: Re-gluing or replacing the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Audi S6, while offering impressive performance and luxury, is susceptible to several common issues, primarily related to its V10 engine, transmission, air suspension, and electrical systems. The most significant concerns revolve around carbon buildup, oil leaks, timing chain issues, and air suspension failures. These issues can be costly to repair, making thorough inspection and maintenance essential for potential buyers. While the S6 offers an engaging driving experience, the potential for high repair costs should be carefully considered.
