### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Audi S6 demonstrates a generally strong reliability record, particularly in its exterior and interior components, where no significant widespread issues are reported. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to its high-performance powertrain and advanced systems. Potential buyers should be aware of possible issues with oil leaks and turbochargers in the V6 engine, as well as occasional transmission hesitation. The adaptive air suspension, while offering superior comfort and handling, can be a source of costly repairs if air struts develop leaks. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most likely candidates for technical attention and associated repair costs.
