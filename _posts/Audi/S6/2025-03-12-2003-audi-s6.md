*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various locations, including the coolant reservoir, hoses, and the auxiliary water pump. Leaks can lead to overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking components, such as hoses, reservoirs, or the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, and other engine seals. These leaks can cause oil consumption and potentially damage other components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found
