# 2020 Audi Q5 PHEV

### Overview
The 2020 Audi Q5 PHEV, also known as the 55 TFSI e quattro, represents Audi's foray into plug-in hybrid technology for its popular compact luxury SUV. This model combines a turbocharged gasoline engine with an electric motor, offering a blend of performance and efficiency. Reliability data for this specific PHEV variant is still emerging as it's a relatively new powertrain configuration for the Q5. However, based on the established reliability of the standard Q5 platform and Audi's general engineering standards, the Q5 PHEV is expected to offer a solid ownership experience. Owners should be aware of the added complexity of the hybrid system, which may introduce unique potential failure points compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

The primary area of concern, as with most plug-in hybrids, revolves around the longevity and potential degradation of the high-voltage battery system, though this is often mitigated by robust manufacturer warranties. Electrical components, particularly the infotainment system, may occasionally exhibit software-related glitches that are typically resolved with updates. The gasoline engine and dual-clutch transmission have proven robust in other Audi applications. For owners, proactive maintenance and awareness of the hybrid system's specific needs will contribute to a positive ownership experience.
