The 2021 Audi Q5 PHEV, or Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle, combines a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and a 17.9 kWh battery pack. This combination delivers a total system output of 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The standard gasoline-only engine options for the 2021 Q5 included a 2.0-liter turbo four producing either 201 or 261 horsepower, paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. The PHEV aims to offer the best of both worlds: electric-only driving for shorter commutes and gasoline power for longer trips. Owners often praise the Q5 PHEV for its fuel efficiency, luxurious interior, and comfortable ride. Common complaints often revolve around the electric range being less than advertised in real-world conditions, occasional software glitches, and the higher price point compared to non-hybrid Q5 models.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**
*   **Reduced Electric Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report achieving significantly less than the advertised electric range (estimated around 19 miles) in real-world driving conditions, especially in colder temperatures or at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: No specific fix available. Driving habits (e.g., minimizing aggressive acceleration, using regenerative braking) and preconditioning the vehicle while plugged in can help maximize the electric range. Regular tire pressure checks can also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
        Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

**Battery**

*   **Battery degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery degrades over time due to driving, temperature, and age. Hybrid vehicles from 2021 are likely to have a reduction in overall range.
    *   Solution: Battery Replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $10,000+
    Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**Overall Electrical System**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) infotainment system occasionally freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Audi may address these issues. A temporary fix is often to restart the system by holding down the volume/power button. In some cases, a more extensive system reset or hardware replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $500+ (hardware replacement)
        Recalls: None Found
*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 12V auxiliary battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can result in difficulty starting the car or electrical system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Investigate potential parasitic drains from aftermarket accessories or faulty modules. Replacing the 12V battery with an upgraded AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) battery may also help. Ensure the vehicle is properly shut down and all accessories are turned off when parked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (battery replacement)

**Overall Summary:**

The 2021 Audi Q5 PHEV generally receives positive reviews, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues mentioned above. The most significant concerns appear to be related to the reduced electric range and the infotainment system glitches. Electrical issues and interior rattles are also commonly reported. While most of these issues are not catastrophic, they can be frustrating and potentially costly to address. The severity of these issues varies, with some owners experiencing no problems at all and others encountering multiple issues. The cost to fix these problems can range from minimal for software updates to several hundred dollars for hardware replacements or repairs.
