### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Audi Q5 PHEV generally exhibits good reliability, particularly in its non-hybrid components. However, as with most plug-in hybrids, the complexity of the powertrain introduces potential areas for concern. Issues related to the hybrid battery system, such as degradation or charging faults, are the most significant potential expenses, though often covered by warranty. Transmission issues, specifically with the mechatronic unit or clutch packs, can also be costly. Engine-related problems like coolant leaks and turbocharger issues are less common but require attention. Electrical gremlins within the infotainment system are typically resolved with software updates. Owners should prioritize regular maintenance and be aware of the potential costs associated with hybrid-specific components.
