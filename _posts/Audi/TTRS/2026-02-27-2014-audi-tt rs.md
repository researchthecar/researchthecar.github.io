### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Audi TT RS, while a potent performer, exhibits some specific reliability concerns primarily centered around its powertrain. The 2.5L turbocharged engine can experience issues with its PCV valve, turbocharger, and ignition coils, which can lead to noticeable performance degradation and warning lights. Transmission reliability also varies; manual transmissions may require clutch replacements over time, while the S tronic dual-clutch automatic can be susceptible to mechatronics unit failures and fluid leaks. Other areas like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components generally do not present widespread, recurring technical issues beyond normal wear and tear. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any reported symptoms are crucial for maintaining the TT RS's performance and longevity.
