Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2022 Audi SQ5 Sportback, organized by category and component. The SQ5 Sportback is a performance-oriented compact SUV known for its sporty handling, stylish design (the sloping roofline differentiates it from the standard SQ5), and luxurious interior. The 2022 SQ5 Sportback is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine, producing 349 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. A common point of praise is the car's responsive engine and engaging driving dynamics, while some criticisms often involve the compromised rear headroom due to the Sportback design and the sometimes-complicated infotainment system. There are no other engine options. The 2022 SQ5 Sportback utilizes an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission.
