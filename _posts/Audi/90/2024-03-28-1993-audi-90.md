**Introduction to the 1993 Audi 90**

The 1993 Audi 90 was a compact executive car offered in both sedan and wagon body styles. It was available with a range of engine and transmission options:

* 2.0L inline-four with a 5-speed manual transmission
* 2.0L inline-four with a 4-speed automatic transmission
* 2.3L inline-five with a 5-speed manual transmission

The 2.0L inline-four engine generated 113 horsepower, while the 2.3L inline-five produced 130 horsepower. Both engines were praised for their smooth power delivery and impressive fuel economy.

Audi enthusiasts appreciated the 90's comfortable interior, refined driving experience, and standard safety features. However, it also had some notable drawbacks, including limited rear seat legroom and a somewhat bland exterior design.
