The 2021 Audi R8 is a high-performance sports car available as a coupe or convertible (Spyder). It comes standard with a 5.2-liter V10 engine producing 562 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque in the base RWD models, or 602 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque in the Performance AWD models. All R8 models use a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (S-tronic). Owners generally praise the R8 for its stunning looks, exhilarating performance, and surprisingly comfortable ride for a supercar. Common complaints revolve around limited practicality, a dated infotainment system compared to newer Audi models, and the high cost of ownership.

**Summary**

The 2021 Audi R8, while a desirable performance car, is not without its potential issues. The most concerning are potential transmission mechatronic failures and magnetic ride control damper leaks, both of which can be costly to repair. Oil leaks, while potentially less severe, should still be addressed promptly. The infotainment system issues are more of an annoyance than a serious mechanical problem. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their ownership costs.
