The 2018 Audi R8 is a high-performance sports car available as a coupe or convertible. It's powered by a naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V10 engine, producing either 532 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque in the base model or 602 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque in the R8 V10 Plus. Both versions are paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch S tronic transmission. Owners rave about the R8's exhilarating performance, distinctive styling, and surprisingly comfortable ride for a supercar. Downsides often cited include its relatively small interior, limited storage space, and higher running costs compared to more conventional vehicles.

**Summary**

The 2018 Audi R8, while a thrilling supercar, can present owners with some notable issues. Engine oil consumption and potential exhaust manifold cracks are concerns. The S tronic transmission can suffer from rough shifting and, in more severe cases, Mechatronic unit failure. The magnetic ride control, electrical systems, and headlights are also areas to watch. While some problems are relatively minor, others can be expensive to repair, making a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified technician crucial. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, so prospective buyers should be aware of the potential risks and budget accordingly.
