### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Audi R8 is a highly desirable supercar with a generally strong reliability record for its class. The V8 engine is robust, and manual transmissions are typically trouble-free. The R Tronic automated manual transmission, however, can present more complex and costly issues, primarily related to its clutch actuator and hydraulic system. Optional Magnetic Ride Control dampers can also be a significant expense if they fail. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and complexity. Owners should prioritize regular maintenance, especially oil level checks for the V8, and be prepared for potential repairs on the R Tronic system and optional suspension components.
