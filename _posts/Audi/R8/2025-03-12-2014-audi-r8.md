The 2014 Audi R8 is a mid-engine sports car known for its striking design, exhilarating performance, and luxurious interior. Engine options for this year included a 4.2-liter V8 producing 430 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.2-liter V10 offering either 525 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque or 550 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque in the V10 Plus trim. Transmission choices consisted of a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic. Owners often praise the R8 for its exotic looks, engaging driving dynamics, and the visceral sound of its engines. Common criticisms include limited cargo space, a relatively firm ride (especially with the optional sport suspension), and higher than average maintenance costs associated with a high-performance vehicle.

**4.2L V8**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 4.2L V8 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, leading to rough idling, misfires, and decreased performance.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on location and severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the V8, the V10 is also susceptible to carbon buildup on the intake valves, resulting in rough idling, misfires, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
