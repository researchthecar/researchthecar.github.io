# 2009 Audi R8

### Overview
The 2009 Audi R8, a mid-engine sports car, is generally regarded as a reliable performance vehicle. Its exotic nature and relatively low production numbers mean that widespread, common failures are less frequently reported compared to mass-produced vehicles. However, like any high-performance machine, specific components can experience issues, particularly as the vehicle ages. Owners should be aware of potential concerns related to its advanced powertrain and specialized systems. Regular maintenance by qualified technicians is crucial for preserving the R8's performance and longevity. This analysis focuses on documented, non-wear-and-tear related issues.

### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Audi R8, while a desirable supercar, presents a mixed reliability profile. The V8 engine is generally robust, but some units can exhibit higher-than-normal oil consumption. The V10 engine has fewer reported issues. Transmission reliability varies significantly; the manual is straightforward, but the R tronic automated manual can be prone to hydraulic and mechatronic unit failures, which are costly to repair. The optional Magnetic Ride Control dampers can also fail. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and complexity. Overall, the R8 requires diligent maintenance and can incur significant repair costs for specific component failures, especially concerning the R tronic transmission and advanced suspension systems.
