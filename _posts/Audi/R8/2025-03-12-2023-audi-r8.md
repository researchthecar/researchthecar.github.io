The 2023 Audi R8 represents the last year of production for this iconic supercar. It's celebrated for its naturally aspirated V10 engine, sharp handling, and distinctive styling. The 2023 model is exclusively available with a 5.2-liter V10 engine, offered in two states of tune: the R8 V10 performance quattro with 602 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, and the R8 V10 quattro with 562 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the R8 for its exhilarating performance and engaging driving experience, while some common complaints revolve around its limited practicality, especially the small trunk space, and relatively high running costs.
