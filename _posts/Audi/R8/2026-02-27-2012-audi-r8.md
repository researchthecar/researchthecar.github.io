### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi R8 is a highly desirable supercar with a generally strong reliability record for its class. The V8 and V10 engines are robust, though specific issues like dry sump leaks on the V8 and valve spring concerns on the V10 have been noted. The manual transmission is typically trouble-free, while the R-Tronic automated manual can present challenges with its clutch actuator and hydraulic pump. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are the most common non-powertrain issues. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are generally reliable, with optional Magnetic Ride Control being the primary exception for suspension-related concerns. Owners should budget for specialized maintenance and potential repairs inherent to a high-performance exotic vehicle.
