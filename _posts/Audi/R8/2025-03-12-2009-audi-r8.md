The 2009 Audi R8 is a mid-engine sports car known for its striking design, engaging driving experience, and naturally aspirated engines. The standard engine for the 2009 model year was a 4.2-liter V8 producing 420 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. The R8 was also available with a 5.2-liter V10 engine. The 4.2L V8 was paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed R-Tronic automated manual transmission. Owners appreciate the R8 for its exotic looks, balanced handling, and the visceral sound of the V8 or V10 engine. Common complaints include the automated manual transmission's sometimes jerky shifts, higher-than-average maintenance costs, and limited cargo space.
