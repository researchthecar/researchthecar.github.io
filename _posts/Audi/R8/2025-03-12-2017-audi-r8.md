Alright, here's the breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2017 Audi R8, formatted for your website. The 2017 Audi R8 is a mid-engine sports car known for its exhilarating performance and striking design. It was available with two engine options: a 5.2-liter V10 producing either 540 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque in the standard R8, or 610 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque in the R8 V10 Plus. Both engines were paired with a 7-speed S-Tronic dual-clutch transmission. Owners typically praise the R8's impressive acceleration, sharp handling, and comfortable interior for a sports car. Common dislikes often center around the car's high price tag, limited cargo space, and the cost of maintenance.

**Engine**

**5.2L V10 (540 HP / 610 HP)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, particularly with the early production 2017 models. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil between scheduled services and potential low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels closely and potentially switching to a different oil viscosity. In severe cases, a rebuild of the engine may be required to address internal wear or sealing issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $10,000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks have been reported from various locations, including hoses, water pump, and the coolant reservoir. Symptoms include a low coolant warning light, visible coolant under the car, and a sweet smell.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty component. This could involve replacing hoses, the water pump, or the coolant reservoir.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S-Tronic Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hesitation during initial acceleration or rough shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can manifest as a delayed response to throttle input or jerky gear changes.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes resolve this issue. In other cases, a clutch replacement or mechatronic unit repair may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $8,000+ (clutch replacement/mechatronic repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Fluid Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks can occur around the transmission pan or seals. Symptoms include visible fluid under the car and potential shifting issues if fluid levels drop too low.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking seals or gasket. Ensure the transmission fluid is at the correct level.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The R8's optional magnetic ride control system can experience issues with the dampers, leading to uneven ride quality, knocking noises, or error messages.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected dampers. In some cases, the magnetic ride control module may also need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Audi's infotainment system, particularly the MMI interface, can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update to the MMI system can often resolve these issues. In some cases, replacing the MMI module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $2,000+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as parking sensors, tire pressure sensors, and oxygen sensors, can malfunction. This can trigger warning lights and affect vehicle performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found
