The 2012 Audi R8 is a mid-engine sports car known for its performance and striking design. For the 2012 model year, it was offered with two engine options: a 4.2L V8 producing 430 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.2L V10 generating 525 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed R-tronic single-clutch automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the R8 for its exhilarating performance, distinctive styling, and relatively comfortable ride for a supercar. Some criticisms include the R-tronic transmission's occasionally jerky shifts and the higher maintenance costs associated with a high-performance vehicle.

**Engine**

**4.2L V8**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 4.2L V8 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, leading to reduced performance, rough idling, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) is required to remove the carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various engine seals, including the valve cover gaskets and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.2L V10**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.2L V8, the 5.2L V10 experiences carbon buildup on the intake valves, causing reduced performance, rough idling, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) is required to remove the carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various engine seals, including the valve cover gaskets and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Magnetic Ride System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the V10's magnetic ride system, resulting in bouncy or uneven damping.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the magnetic ride shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear, especially with aggressive driving, leading to slipping and difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shifter Cable Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shifter cables can stretch or break, leading to difficulty selecting gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shifter cables.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed R-tronic (Automated Manual)**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The R-tronic's single-clutch design can lead to accelerated clutch wear, particularly with city driving or frequent stop-and-go traffic, resulting in slipping and jerky shifts.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+ (due to the complexity of the system)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hydraulic pump that operates the R-tronic's clutch and shifting mechanisms can fail, leading to a complete loss of shifting ability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The R-tronic transmission is known for harsh and jerky shifts, particularly in automatic mode.
    *   Solution: Software updates and proper maintenance can help mitigate the issue, but it is a characteristic of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for software updates), but may not fully resolve the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The magnetic ride dampers can leak or fail, leading to poor ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200+ per damper.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**Summary**

The 2012 Audi R8, while offering impressive performance and styling, can be prone to certain issues. Carbon buildup on both engine options is a common concern. The R-tronic transmission, in particular, can be expensive to maintain due to potential clutch wear and hydraulic pump failures. Magnetic ride issues may also arise on V10 models. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, making pre-purchase inspection and proper maintenance crucial.
