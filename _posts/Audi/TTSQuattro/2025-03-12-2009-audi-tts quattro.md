The 2009 Audi TTS Quattro is a sporty, compact coupe known for its turbocharged performance and all-wheel drive handling. The TTS variant takes the standard TT and elevates it with a more potent engine and enhanced styling. For the 2009 model year, the sole engine option was a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, producing 265 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic. Drivers often praise the TTS for its engaging driving dynamics, stylish design, and premium interior. Common dislikes include the firm ride, limited rear seat space, and potential for costly repairs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (265 hp)**

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or chirping noise during acceleration, loss of boost, reduced power, and potentially a check engine light. The factory diverter valve (especially the earlier diaphragm-type valves) is prone to cracking or leaking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the diverter valve. Upgraded piston-type diverter valves are a popular choice for improved reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Follower Wear/Failure (High-Pressure Fuel Pump)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, especially at idle. The cam follower, located between the camshaft and the high-pressure fuel pump, is known to wear prematurely. If not addressed, it can lead to more severe damage to the camshaft and fuel pump.
    *   Solution: Regular inspection and replacement of the cam follower. Use of a revised or aftermarket cam follower is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for follower replacement; $500 - $1500+ for camshaft and fuel pump damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise, especially on start-up. Potential for severe engine damage if the timing chain jumps teeth. The earlier tensioner designs are known to be problematic.
