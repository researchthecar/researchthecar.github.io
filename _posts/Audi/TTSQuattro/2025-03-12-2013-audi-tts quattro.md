The 2013 Audi TTS Quattro is a performance-oriented coupe known for its sporty handling, stylish design, and turbocharged engine. It features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 265 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. All models came standard with the 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. Owners appreciate the TTS for its agile handling and quick acceleration, but some dislike the firm ride and relatively small interior space.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (265 hp)**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. In severe cases, the engine can experience a loss of power, misfires, or even catastrophic failure if the timing chain jumps. This issue is more common in earlier versions of the 2.0T engine but can affect the 2013 model year as well.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, chain, and guides. It is often recommended to replace the water pump at the same time as it is within the same area of work and can be preventative maintenace
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost, hesitation during acceleration, and potentially a check engine light. The diverter valve, responsible for relieving pressure in the turbocharger system, can fail due to diaphragm tears or other mechanical issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the diverter valve. Upgraded aftermarket diverter valves are also available and are sometimes chosen to improve reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, and a check engine light. Cracks and leaks can develop in the intake manifold, leading to vacuum leaks that disrupt engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed S tronic (DSG)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, erratic shifting behavior, transmission slipping, or complete loss of drive. The Mechatronic unit, the transmission's control module, can suffer from internal electrical or hydraulic failures.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the Mechatronic unit, or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, especially in higher gears, jerky engagement, and difficulty shifting. The clutches within the DSG transmission can wear out over time, especially with aggressive driving or tuning.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch packs. This typically involves replacing both the K1 and K2 clutch packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride height, a bouncy or harsh ride, suspension warning lights, and inoperative suspension modes. The MRC dampers can leak fluid or experience internal failures, compromising their damping ability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected MRC dampers. It is often recommended to replace dampers in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per damper, depending on labor and parts costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illumination, traction control light illumination, potentially impaired braking performance. Wheel speed sensors can fail, causing the ABS system to malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ABS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, check engine light. Ignition coils can fail due to heat and age.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It's often recommended to replace all coils at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per coil installed
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Issues (Xenon/HID)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Flickering headlights, uneven brightness, or complete headlight failure. The HID bulbs, ballasts, or igniters can fail over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the bulb, ballast, or igniter as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the component and if OEM or aftermarket parts are used)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: System freezes, slow response times, screen glitches, or complete system failure. Internal components of the infotainment system can fail.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the repair needed and whether a new or used unit is installed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Audi TTS Quattro, while a fun and capable sports coupe, is prone to certain issues that owners should be aware of. Engine problems like timing chain tensioner and diverter valve failures, along with potential transmission issues related to the Mechatronic unit and clutch packs, can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension, electrical, and interior issues, while less frequent, can also contribute to overall ownership expenses. The severity of these problems can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic experienced with Audi vehicles.
