**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (EA113)**

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, hesitation during acceleration, check engine light may illuminate. The diverter valve, which recirculates excess boost pressure, can crack or tear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the diverter valve. Revised versions of the valve (e.g., piston-type) are more durable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Cam Follower Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, especially at idle. Eventually, the worn follower can damage the camshaft, leading to more significant issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam follower. Regular inspection and replacement is recommended. If the camshaft is damaged, it will also need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for follower replacement; $1000+ if camshaft replacement is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, decreased fuel economy, hesitation during acceleration, misfires. Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over the valves.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (e.g., walnut blasting) or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed S Tronic Dual-Clutch Transmission (DQ250)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, transmission slipping, inability to select gears, warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the Mechatronic unit. In some cases, software updates can resolve minor issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, especially in higher gears. Jerky engagement.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking fluid from the dampers, uneven ride height, poor ride quality, knocking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Suspension Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, vague steering, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per bushing, depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent display issues, flickering lights, complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car sits unused for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Solution: Identifying and resolving the source of the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Audi TTS Quattro offers sporty performance, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine problems such as diverter valve failure and carbon buildup can lead to performance issues. Transmission problems with the S Tronic transmission can be costly. Suspension problems, electrical problems, and interior issues are also of concern. The severity of these issues varies, but some (e.g., Mechatronic unit failure) can be quite expensive to repair.
