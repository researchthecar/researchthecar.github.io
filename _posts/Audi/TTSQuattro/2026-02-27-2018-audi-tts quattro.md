### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Audi TTS Quattro demonstrates good overall reliability, consistent with Audi's reputation for building quality performance vehicles. The primary areas where owners might encounter issues are related to the advanced powertrain and optional adaptive suspension. Specific concerns include potential coolant leaks and PCV valve issues on the 2.0L turbocharged engine, and more significantly, potential problems with the dual-clutch transmission's mechatronic unit or clutch packs. The adaptive suspension, while enhancing performance, can be a source of costly repairs if dampers fail. Electrical and interior components generally perform well, with occasional infotainment software glitches being the most common, though usually resolvable with updates. For prospective buyers, a thorough pre-purchase inspection, especially focusing on the transmission and suspension, is recommended.
