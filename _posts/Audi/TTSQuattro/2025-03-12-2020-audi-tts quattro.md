The 2020 Audi TTS Quattro is a high-performance sports coupe known for its sleek design, powerful engine, and sporty handling. The only engine option for the TTS is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 288 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. It comes standard with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. People like the TTS for its quick acceleration, sharp handling, and stylish interior. Some common complaints include the somewhat firm ride, limited rear passenger space, and the infotainment system can be distracting to use while driving.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are a common issue on many VW/Audi vehicles with the 2.0T engine. Symptoms can include a low coolant warning light, visible coolant puddles under the car (usually pink or orange), and the smell of coolant. The water pump or thermostat housing are the most common locations.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking component. The water pump often includes a new thermostat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct-injection engines like the 2.0T are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves due to the lack of fuel washing over the valves. Symptoms include rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, reduced fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) is the most effective method.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit is the brain of the dual-clutch transmission. Failure can cause harsh or jerky shifting, delayed engagement, difficulty selecting gears, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Mechatronic unit or, in some cases, the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $8000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S tronic transmission uses clutches to engage and disengage gears. Over time, these clutches can wear out, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping, shuddering during gear changes, and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutches. This often involves replacing other components as well, such as the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The optional Magnetic Ride Control uses special dampers filled with fluid that can change viscosity based on an electrical current. This allows for adjustable damping. Issues can include failure of the dampers, leading to a bouncy or harsh ride, or failure of the control module, triggering warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty damper or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per damper, $500 - $1000+ for the control module.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI infotainment system can sometimes freeze, crash, or exhibit other glitches. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the MMI unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates), $1000 - $3000+ for MMI unit replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors and other sensors can fail, leading to false alerts or a complete lack of functionality.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **LED Lighting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: LED headlights, taillights, or daytime running lights can sometimes fail or flicker. This can be due to a faulty LED module or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the LED module or repairing the wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the light and the complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters can fail to heat, or can overheat. This is often due to a broken heating element in the seat.
    *   Solution: Replacing the seat heating element.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof can fail to open or close properly, or may leak when closed. This can be due to a faulty motor, damaged seals, or debris in the tracks.
