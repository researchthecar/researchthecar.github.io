### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Audi TTS Quattro is a reliable sports car with a strong performance pedigree. The most commonly reported technical issues tend to be related to the sophisticated dual-clutch transmission, particularly the mechatronic unit and clutch packs, which can lead to costly repairs. Engine-related concerns, such as PCV valve failures and coolant leaks, are also noted but are generally less severe. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment system, can occur but are often resolved with software updates. Suspension components, particularly the adaptive dampers, can be expensive to replace if they fail. Overall, while not immune to problems, the TTS Quattro offers a good balance of performance and dependability, provided potential buyers are aware of and prepared for the costs associated with its advanced systems.
