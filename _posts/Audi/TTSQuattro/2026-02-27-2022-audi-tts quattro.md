### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Audi TTS Quattro offers a compelling blend of performance and style with generally good reliability. The primary areas that may require attention are related to the powertrain, specifically potential issues with the PCV valve and oil consumption in the 2.0L turbocharged engine, and occasional mechatronic unit or clutch pack concerns in the S tronic transmission. The adaptive suspension can also be a source of repair costs if dampers fail. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are not uncommon. However, for a performance car, these issues are within expected parameters, and with diligent maintenance, the TTS Quattro should provide an engaging and largely trouble-free ownership experience.
