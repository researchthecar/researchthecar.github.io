Common criticisms include its firm ride, limited rear seat space, and relatively high price point for its size.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (EA888)**

* **Oil Consumption Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every few thousand miles, blue smoke from the exhaust upon startup, and potential low oil pressure warnings. This can be caused by piston ring issues.
    * Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the problem. Depending on the severity, the fix can range from using a thicker oil to a complete engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **PCV Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) valve can fail, causing a vacuum leak. This leads to rough idling, poor fuel economy, and potentially a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the PCV valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Ignition Coil Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: One or more ignition coils can fail, leading to misfires and a rough-running engine. The check engine light will illuminate, and a diagnostic scan will reveal the faulty coil(s).
    * Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Automatic**

* **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit, which controls the shifting of the dual-clutch transmission, can fail. Symptoms include jerky shifting, hesitation, failure to engage gears, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replace or rebuild the mechatronic unit. In some cases, the transmission may need to be replaced entirely.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Clutch Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Due to the nature of a dual-clutch transmission, clutch wear is normal but can become problematic at higher mileages. Symptoms include slipping during acceleration, shuddering, and difficulty shifting.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch packs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Magnetic Ride Control (If Equipped) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The magnetic ride control system, if equipped, can experience issues with the dampers. This can manifest as a loss of damping ability, a bumpy or harsh ride, and warning lights.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty damper(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per damper
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, such as freezing, slow response times, and connectivity issues.

    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures**
     * Description/Symptoms: Multiple sensors have been reported to fail such as the MAF, Wheel Speed Sensor, and Throttle Position Sensor. Failure can be indicated by a check engine light on the dash.
     * Solution: Replace the faulty sensor
     * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
     * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Audi TTS Quattro, while a fun and capable car, has some potential issues to be aware of. Engine oil consumption, mechatronic unit failure in the transmission, and infotainment system glitches seem to be the most common problems. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major repairs like mechatronic unit replacement or engine work. Potential buyers should have the car inspected thoroughly, paying close attention to the transmission's performance and the engine's oil consumption.
