# 2015 Audi TTS Quattro

### Overview
The 2015 Audi TTS Quattro, a performance-oriented variant of the TT model, is generally regarded as a reliable vehicle, particularly given its sporty nature. It typically features a potent turbocharged engine and a capable all-wheel-drive system. Owners often praise its engaging driving dynamics, premium interior, and distinctive styling. While no vehicle is entirely free from potential issues, the TTS Quattro tends to exhibit a good track record for its powertrain and core mechanical components.

### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi TTS Quattro is a compelling sports coupe with a generally strong reliability record. The 2.0L turbocharged engine is robust, though occasional issues with the PCV valve and turbocharger can arise, as is common with performance engines. The DSG transmission, while offering rapid shifts, has had documented instances of mechatronics unit and clutch pack wear, which can be costly to repair. The manual transmission is typically more straightforward. Suspension components, especially the optional magnetic ride, can be a point of failure. Electrical systems, particularly the infotainment, may experience minor glitches. Overall, the TTS Quattro offers a good balance of performance and reliability, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific transmission and optional suspension system's potential repair costs.
