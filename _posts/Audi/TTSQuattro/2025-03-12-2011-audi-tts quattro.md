The 2011 Audi TTS Quattro is a sporty and stylish coupe known for its turbocharged performance and all-wheel-drive grip. The 2011 TTS Quattro exclusively features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 265 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions were a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic. Owners typically praise the car's responsive handling, quick acceleration, and distinctive design. Downsides often mentioned include the firm ride, limited rear seat space, and the potential for relatively high maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (265 hp)**

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, reduced engine performance, potential for engine misfires. A common failure point is the diaphragm within the diverter valve, which can crack or tear.
    *   Solution: Replace the diverter valve. Aftermarket options are available that are more durable than the OEM valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It's recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per coil (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise on startup, potential for catastrophic engine damage if the timing chain skips. This issue is prevalent on earlier 2.0T engines, and while less common on the 2011 TTS, it can still occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioner, and guides. This is a major repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy. Direct injection engines like the 2.0T are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing them.
    *   Solution: Manually clean the intake valves (walnut blasting or chemical cleaning).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, delayed engagement, transmission slipping, or complete loss of drive. The Mechatronic unit is the TCU (Transmission Control Unit) and hydraulic control module.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the Mechatronic unit. Requires specialized knowledge and tools.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Pack Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, jerky shifts, shuddering. The dual-clutch transmission relies on clutch packs that can wear over time, especially with aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (if equipped) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride, leaking struts, suspension malfunction warning lights. The magnetic ride control shocks can fail over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected magnetic ride control strut(s). Can be expensive due to the specialized components. Some owners opt to replace the MRC with standard shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixelation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels failing or fading on the instrument cluster display. This is a common issue on older Audi models.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window not operating, slow or erratic window movement.
    *   Solution: Replace the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Spoiler Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear spoiler not deploying or retracting properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the spoiler motor or the entire spoiler assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/Radio Head Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Head unit not powering on, screen flickering, or malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Audi TTS Quattro, while a fun and capable sports car, can present owners with several potential issues. Engine-related problems such as diverter valve failure and carbon buildup are fairly common. The S tronic transmission, while offering quick shifts, is prone to Mechatronic unit and clutch pack issues, which can be quite costly to repair. Suspension issues, particularly with the magnetic ride control (if equipped), can also arise. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster pixelation, and exterior issues like the rear spoiler motor failure, can also occur. Overall, while the TTS is enjoyable to drive, potential owners should be aware of the possibility of relatively high maintenance costs due to these potential problems. The severity of issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs that can cost several thousand dollars.
