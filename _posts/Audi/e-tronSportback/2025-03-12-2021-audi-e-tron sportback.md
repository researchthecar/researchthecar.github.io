The 2021 Audi e-tron Sportback is an all-electric SUV coupe that offers a blend of luxury, performance, and practicality. The 2021 e-tron Sportback is equipped with two electric motors, one on each axle, providing standard all-wheel drive. The combined output is 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque in normal driving mode, which can be temporarily boosted to 402 horsepower and 490 lb-ft in "boost" mode. Owners often praise its smooth acceleration, comfortable ride, and quiet cabin. However, some criticisms include the relatively short driving range compared to some competitors, the high price point, and occasional software glitches.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Electric Motor (355-402 hp)**
* **Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing greater-than-expected battery degradation over time, leading to a reduction in the vehicle's maximum range. The amount of degradation reported varies significantly.
    * Solution: Battery health can be somewhat preserved by optimizing charging habits (avoiding frequent full charges and discharges). In cases of severe degradation, Audi's battery warranty (8 years/100,000 miles) may cover a replacement or repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: If not covered by warranty, a full battery replacement can be very expensive, potentially exceeding $20,000.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Reduced Performance in Cold Weather**
    * Description/Symptoms: Electric vehicle range and performance are often impacted by cold temperatures. Some 2021 e-tron Sportback owners have reported a more significant drop in range than expected in cold weather conditions.
    * Solution: Preconditioning the battery while plugged in can help mitigate the impact of cold weather. Using seat and steering wheel heaters instead of the climate control system can also conserve energy.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (this is an inherent characteristic of EV technology)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Software Glitches/Infotainment Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing occasional software glitches in the infotainment system, including screen freezes, unresponsive controls, and connectivity problems with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    * Solution: Software updates from Audi can often resolve these issues. A hard reset of the infotainment system might also provide temporary relief.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Often covered under warranty. Out-of-warranty repairs could range from $100+ for troubleshooting to potentially hundreds or thousands for hardware replacement, depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Charging Port Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulties experienced when the vehicle is charging, with some reporting the charge port door malfunctioning and not opening or closing properly. The charging rate has also been reported to be slower than expected.
    * Solution: Software updates, part replacements.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Panoramic Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report creaking or rattling noises emanating from the panoramic sunroof while driving, especially on uneven road surfaces.
    * Solution: Lubricating the sunroof seals and tracks might reduce the noise. In some cases, a dealer adjustment or replacement of the sunroof mechanism may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Adjustment and lubrication might be relatively inexpensive ($50-$200). Sunroof mechanism replacement could be considerably more ($500 - $2000+).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Seat Creaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Creaking noises coming from the front seats, specifically during acceleration, braking, or cornering.
    * Solution: Seat frame adjustment or lubrication of seat components may resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix:  $100 - $400+, depending on the severity and complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2021 Audi e-tron Sportback generally experiences fewer major mechanical issues compared to traditional combustion engine vehicles. The most frequently cited problems revolve around electrical components and software glitches. While battery degradation is a concern for all EVs, the reported cases for the e-tron Sportback seem to vary widely. The severity of the issues can range from minor annoyances to more significant problems that require dealer intervention. Costs for repairs can vary significantly, with software fixes and adjustments being relatively inexpensive, while hardware replacements (like the battery or sunroof mechanism) can be quite costly, especially if not covered by warranty.
