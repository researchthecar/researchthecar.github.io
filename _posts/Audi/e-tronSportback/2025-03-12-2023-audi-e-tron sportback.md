**Electric Motor**

**Dual Motor Electric**

*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced range over time, less energy output. Owners report some degradation within the first year, particularly in extreme temperatures or with frequent fast charging.
    *   Solution: Limited warranty coverage for battery degradation, but only if it falls below a certain threshold (typically around 70% capacity within a specified timeframe). Replacement of individual modules or the entire battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery pack replacement can be very expensive. If it's not covered under warranty, it could cost $10,000 - $20,000+.
    * Recalls: None Found
