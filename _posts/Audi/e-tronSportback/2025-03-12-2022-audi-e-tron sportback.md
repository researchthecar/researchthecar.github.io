Many owners appreciate the car's smooth acceleration, quiet cabin, and luxurious features. Common complaints often revolve around the car's range compared to competitors, charging speeds, and some infotainment system quirks.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Electric Motors**

*   **Motor Coolant Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported coolant leaks originating from the electric motor cooling system. Symptoms can include low coolant warning lights, puddles of coolant under the vehicle, and potential overheating of the motor.
    *   Solution: The affected coolant lines and/or the coolant reservoir may need to be replaced. The cooling system should be pressure tested to locate the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some drivers have experienced instances where the vehicle unexpectedly enters a reduced power mode (sometimes referred to as "turtle mode"), significantly limiting acceleration and top speed. This can be triggered by various factors, including battery management system issues, overheating, or sensor malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis requires connecting the vehicle to a diagnostic tool to read fault codes. The specific repair depends on the root cause, which may involve software updates, sensor replacement, or battery module repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on cause, $200 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Reduced Range/Premature Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a noticeable decrease in the vehicle's range over time, potentially indicating faster-than-expected battery degradation. This can be exacerbated by frequent DC fast charging and extreme temperatures.
    *   Solution: Audi dealerships can perform battery health checks to assess the state of the battery. While some degradation is normal, excessive degradation may be covered under the battery warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: If not covered under warranty, replacement of battery module can be 10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Issues/Slow Charging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty charging at public charging stations or slow charging speeds even with the correct equipment. This may be due to a faulty onboard charger, a problem with the charging port, or a software issue.
    * Solution: Diagnostic scan of the charging system, inspection of the charging port, and potential replacement of the onboard charger or software update.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical System**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealership is often the fix. In some cases, a hardware replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature depletion of the 12V auxiliary battery, leading to issues such as the vehicle not starting or various electrical systems malfunctioning. This can be caused by parasitic drain or a faulty battery management system.
    *   Solution: A thorough diagnostic check to identify the source of the battery drain. Replacement of the 12V battery, repair of the battery management system, or fixing the parasitic drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tail Light Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: LED tail lights failing or malfunctioning. This can include sections of the light not illuminating or flickering.
