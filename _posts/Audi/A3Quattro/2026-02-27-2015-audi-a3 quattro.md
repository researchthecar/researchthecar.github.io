### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi A3 Quattro is a generally reliable vehicle, especially when equipped with the 2.0L TFSI engine and either transmission option. The most common reported issues tend to be related to the PCV valve and water pump on the engine, and potential mechatronic unit or clutch pack concerns with the S tronic transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and lighting modules, can also arise. Interior components like climate control actuators and seat motors are not immune to failure. However, these issues are not universally experienced, and many owners report a trouble-free ownership experience. Proactive maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly can significantly contribute to the long-term reliability of the A3 Quattro.
