The 2008 Audi A3 Quattro is a compact luxury car known for its sporty handling, upscale interior, and available all-wheel drive. The Quattro models came standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic (DSG) transmission. While owners generally appreciate the A3's driving dynamics and premium feel, common complaints often revolve around reliability and maintenance costs. Downsides often cited include higher repair expenses compared to non-luxury brands and the need for meticulous maintenance to prevent issues.
