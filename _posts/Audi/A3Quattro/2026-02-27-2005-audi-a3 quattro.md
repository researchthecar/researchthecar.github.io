### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Audi A3 Quattro, particularly with the 2.0L TFSI engine, can be a rewarding vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The TFSI engine is prone to issues like PCV valve failure and timing chain tensioner wear, which can be costly to repair. The DSG transmission, while offering excellent performance, has a known vulnerability with its mechatronic unit and clutch packs. Suspension components, especially control arm bushings, may require attention. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and HVAC resistors are also noted. The manual transmission and exterior/interior components generally fare better. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these known weak points are crucial for maintaining the reliability of a 2005 A3 Quattro.
