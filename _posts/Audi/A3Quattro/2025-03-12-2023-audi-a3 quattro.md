The 2023 Audi A3 Quattro is a compact luxury sedan offering a blend of style, performance, and technology. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, producing 201 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. An alternative engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 that produces 306 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque which is only available on the S3 trim. All models come standard with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (DSG). People often praise the A3 for its sleek design, comfortable interior, and agile handling. However, some criticisms include the relatively small rear seat and the reliance on touch-sensitive controls, which some find less intuitive than traditional buttons and knobs.

**Summary**

The 2023 Audi A3 Quattro, while generally a well-regarded vehicle, does have some common issues. The most concerning potential issue is excessive oil consumption in the 2.0L 201hp engine, which can lead to significant repair costs. The transmission hesitation and infotainment system glitches are less severe but can be annoying. Interior rattles are common across many vehicles and are usually not a major concern, though they can detract from the overall luxury experience. Before purchasing, it's wise to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to check for these potential problems.
