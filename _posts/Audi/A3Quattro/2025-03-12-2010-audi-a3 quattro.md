The 2010 Audi A3 Quattro is a compact luxury car that offers a blend of sporty handling and premium features. This model year came with a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2010 Audi A3 included a 2.0L TDI diesel engine. The 2.0T was available with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed S-Tronic dual-clutch transmission, while the diesel was available with the S-Tronic transmission. People generally appreciate the A3 for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and nimble handling. Some common dislikes include the higher maintenance costs associated with owning a European luxury car and the somewhat cramped rear seating.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (200 HP/207 lb-ft)**

*   **Camshaft Follower Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft follower, which sits between the high-pressure fuel pump and the camshaft, is prone to wear. Symptoms include a ticking noise from the engine, loss of power, and potentially a check engine light. If the follower fails completely, it can damage the camshaft and fuel pump.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft follower preventatively or when symptoms arise. Regularly inspect the follower during oil changes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The diverter valve (also known as a bypass valve) recirculates excess boost pressure. A failing diverter valve can cause a loss of boost, hesitation during acceleration, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the diverter valve. Upgraded aftermarket valves are available for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light are common symptoms of failing ignition coils. This can also occur if the coils get too hot.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per coil
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L TDI Diesel**
* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and a DPF warning light. This is often due to short trips where the DPF cannot regenerate properly.
    * Solution: Perform a forced DPF regeneration with a scan tool. Replace the DPF if regeneration is not possible.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed S-Tronic Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh engagement, and a transmission malfunction warning light are common symptoms of a failing mechatronic unit (the electronic control unit for the transmission).
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. This is caused by worn control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Magnetic Ride Control Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle is equipped with the optional magnetic ride control, the dampers can fail. This leads to a bouncy ride and a suspension malfunction warning.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty magnetic ride dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sunroof Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may not open or close properly, or may make a grinding noise.
    *   Solution: Replace the sunroof motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fabric headliner detaches from the backing board and begins to sag. This is common in older vehicles due to the adhesive deteriorating.
    *   Solution: Re-glue the headliner fabric or replace the entire headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Audi A3 Quattro, while a desirable car, has some common issues owners should be aware of. The most prevalent problems revolve around the 2.0T engine, particularly the camshaft follower and diverter valve, and the S-Tronic transmission. Suspension components, especially control arm bushings, are also known to wear out. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like mechatronic unit failure or replacing magnetic ride dampers, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed to identify any existing or potential issues before making a purchase.
