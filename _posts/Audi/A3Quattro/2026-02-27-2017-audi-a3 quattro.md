### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Audi A3 Quattro is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly in its core mechanical components. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the engine's cooling system and PCV valve on the 186 hp variant, and oil consumption or timing chain concerns on the 220 hp variant. The S tronic transmission, while offering excellent performance, can be prone to mechatronic unit or clutch pack issues, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and LED headlights, are also noted. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms, the 2017 A3 Quattro can provide a satisfying ownership experience.
