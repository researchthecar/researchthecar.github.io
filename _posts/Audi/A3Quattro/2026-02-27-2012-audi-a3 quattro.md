### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi A3 Quattro offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, with a generally good reliability record. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the 2.0L TFSI engine, which can experience PCV valve failures, oil consumption, and timing chain concerns. The DSG transmission, while offering quick shifts, can be prone to mechatronics unit or clutch pack issues. Diesel variants may face DPF and EGR valve problems. The Quattro system itself is robust, but center differential failures, though not extremely common, can be costly. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and infotainment glitches are also noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to maintaining the A3's reliability.
