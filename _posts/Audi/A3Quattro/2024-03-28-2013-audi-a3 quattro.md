**Introduction**

The 2013 Audi A3 Quattro is a compact luxury hatchback that offers a blend of comfort, performance, and technology. It is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine that produces 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque paired with a 6-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. Other engine and transmission options include a 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-4 with 170 horsepower and a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 with 220 horsepower, both mated to a 6-speed manual transmission.
