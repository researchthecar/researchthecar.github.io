### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Audi A3 Quattro presents a generally reliable package, especially with its manual transmission. The 2.0L TFSI engine, while potent, is prone to oil consumption and PCV issues that require diligent monitoring and potential repair. The DSG transmission, though offering quick shifts, can be a source of significant expense if the mechatronic unit or clutch packs fail. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and infotainment glitches are not uncommon. The Quattro system itself is robust. Overall, proactive maintenance and awareness of the specific engine and transmission quirks are key to a positive ownership experience.
