### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Audi A5 presents a generally solid, albeit premium, ownership experience. The most significant areas of concern revolve around the powertrain, particularly the 2.0L TFSI engine's propensity for oil consumption and timing chain issues, and the S tronic dual-clutch transmission's potential clutch wear. Electrical gremlins, such as MMI system glitches, are also noted. While the suspension and interior are typically robust, optional adaptive dampers can be a source of expense. The convertible top mechanism on Cabriolet models requires careful inspection. Prospective buyers should prioritize vehicles with a comprehensive service history, especially for the engine and transmission, and be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs associated with luxury European vehicles.
