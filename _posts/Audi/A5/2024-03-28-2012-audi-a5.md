Owners have praised the A5 for its refined interior, responsive handling, and stylish design, while criticizing its firm ride quality and high maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**2.0T Engine**
- **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:**
    - Description/Symptoms: A rattling or ticking noise at engine start-up, especially after the vehicle has been parked for an extended period. It could also lead to poor engine performance, decreased fuel efficiency, and possible engine damage.
    - Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner and associated components.
    - Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    - Recalls: NHTSA Recall ID 15V562000
- **Intake Valve Deposits:**
    - Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfiring, and reduced engine power. Excessive carbon buildup on the intake valves can obstruct airflow and decrease engine efficiency.
    - Solution: Cleaning or replacing affected intake valves and decarbonizing the engine.
    - Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
- **Turbocharger Wastegate Actuator Failure:**
    - Description/Symptoms: A boost leak or loss of power may occur due to the inability of the actuator to regulate the boost pressure in the turbocharger system, potentially leading to decreased acceleration or limp mode.
    - Solution: Replacing the faulty turbocharger wastegate actuator.
    - Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+

**3.0T Engine**
- **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure:**
