Here is a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2019 Audi A5, categorized by major component, and engine/transmission options.

The 2019 Audi A5 is a stylish and sporty coupe, sportback, and convertible, known for its elegant design, comfortable interior, and refined driving experience. The most common engine option is the 2.0L turbocharged inline-4, producing 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Some owners praise the A5's sleek aesthetics and responsive handling, while others dislike the limited rear passenger space (especially in the coupe) and the sometimes-complex infotainment system.
