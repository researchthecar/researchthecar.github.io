**Introduction to the 2016 Audi A5**

The 2016 Audi A5 is a luxury coupe that combines sleek styling, a spacious interior, and impressive performance. It is available with two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L supercharged V6 producing 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, an 8-speed automatic, and a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic.
