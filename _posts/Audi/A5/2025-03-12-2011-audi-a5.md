The 2011 Audi A5 is a stylish coupe and convertible known for its sleek design and sporty driving dynamics. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 and a 3.2L V6. The 2.0T produces around 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, offering a good balance of performance and fuel efficiency. Some owners praise the A5 for its attractive styling and comfortable interior, while others complain about the higher maintenance costs associated with German luxury vehicles and the potential for electrical issues. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual, an 8-speed automatic, and a CVT (Multitronic) on some front-wheel-drive models.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (TFSI)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The 2.0T engine, particularly in earlier models, is known for consuming excessive amounts of oil. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil between scheduled services, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential low oil pressure warnings. This issue can stem from piston ring design flaws.
    *   Solution:  A common solution involves replacing the pistons and piston rings with an updated design to improve oil sealing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to timing chain slack. This can result in rough running, engine misfires, and potentially catastrophic engine damage if the chain jumps or breaks. Listen for a rattling noise upon startup, especially from the top of the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, timing chain, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**8-Speed Automatic**

*No Issues Found*

**CVT (Multitronic)**

*   **Juddering/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission, particularly when paired with the front-wheel-drive A5, can exhibit juddering, hesitation, or erratic shifting behavior, especially at lower speeds. This is often due to wear and tear on the transmission's internal components, such as the chain and variators.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can improve shift quality. More severe cases may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (Software Update) - $5,000+ (Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the front control arm bushings is common. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps, and vague steering feel.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires can occur due to failing ignition coils. Symptoms include a rough-running engine, decreased performance, and the engine misfire light illuminating on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It's generally recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with excessive battery drain, leading to a dead battery, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing individual circuits and components to isolate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the source
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows may fail to operate properly, either getting stuck or failing to move at all. This is often caused by a faulty window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window regulator is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroofs can experience issues such as failing to open or close properly, becoming stuck, or leaking water.
    *   Solution: The solution depends on the cause of the issue but may involve cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks, replacing the sunroof motor, or repairing the sunroof seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the issue
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The navigation or infotainment system may experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure. This can be caused by software issues or hardware malfunctions.
    *   Solution:  Try updating the system software. If the problem persists, the unit may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the issue
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Audi A5 presents a mix of potential issues. The 2.0T engine's oil consumption and timing chain problems can be costly to address. Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are also relatively common. The CVT transmission, if equipped, can be a source of concern due to potential juddering and reliability issues. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended to assess the vehicle's condition and identify any existing or potential issues. The severity and cost of repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage.
