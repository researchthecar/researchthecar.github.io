The 2022 Audi A5 is a stylish and sporty compact executive car available in coupe, sportback (hatchback), and cabriolet (convertible) body styles. The most common engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, producing either 201 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque (40 TFSI) or 261 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque (45 TFSI). Both engines are paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. People often praise the A5 for its sleek design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving dynamics. Some common dislikes include the relatively small rear seats (especially in the coupe and cabriolet), and the sometimes-complex infotainment system.
