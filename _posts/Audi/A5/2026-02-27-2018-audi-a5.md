### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Audi A5 generally presents a strong reliability record, particularly in its suspension, exterior, and interior components, where no widespread issues are commonly reported. The primary areas of concern tend to be within the powertrain, specifically the 2.0L TFSI engine's potential for oil consumption and PCV valve issues, and the 7-speed S tronic transmission's mechatronic unit and clutch pack durability. Electrical systems, particularly the infotainment unit, can occasionally suffer from software glitches. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not universal. Regular maintenance and addressing early symptoms can help mitigate some of these potential problems, making the A5 a reliable choice for many, especially when considering the more robust S5 powertrain options.
