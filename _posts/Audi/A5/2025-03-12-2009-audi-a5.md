The 2009 Audi A5 is a stylish and sporty coupe known for its sleek design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience. The 2009 A5 came with a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 engine that produces 211 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque or a 3.2L Naturally Aspirated V6 engine producing 265 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic (Tiptronic), or a CVT (Multitronic) depending on the engine and drive configuration (FWD or Quattro AWD). Many owners appreciate the A5's aesthetics and handling, while common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the electrical systems, engine oil consumption, and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report high oil consumption, often needing to add oil between services. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust, and the "low oil" warning light may illuminate frequently. This issue is often attributed to piston ring design flaws.
    * Solution: The most common solution is replacing the piston rings with an updated design to improve oil sealing. In some cases, the entire engine short block may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. If left untreated, the timing chain can jump, leading to severe engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, chain, and guides. Newer tensioner designs are more robust.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.2L Naturally Aspirated V6**

* **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, reduced power, and poor fuel economy. Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on intake valves because there is no fuel washing over the valves to keep them clean.
    * Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) is the most common solution. Chemical cleaning methods can also be used.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around valve cover gaskets and the timing cover.
    * Solution: Replacement of the gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Tiptronic)**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation when accelerating.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change may help. In some cases, valve body repair or replacement is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Multitronic)**

* **Juddering/Shuddering**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shaking or shuddering during acceleration, especially at low speeds. Can also manifest as hesitation or jerky movements.
    * Solution: CVT fluid change with the correct specified fluid is the first step. If the problem persists, the CVT may require valve body repair or replacement. In severe cases, the entire CVT may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially over bumps. Poor handling and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, check engine light illumination.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The car battery drains quickly, especially when the car is left sitting for a short period.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair the cause of the parasitic draw. This can be caused by a faulty module, a malfunctioning sensor, or a short circuit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the cause)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight/Taillight Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Headlights or taillights may flicker, malfunction, or fail prematurely. This can be due to faulty bulbs, wiring issues, or problems with the headlight control module.
    * Solution: Replace faulty bulbs, repair wiring, or replace the headlight control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, make excessive noise, or leak.
    * Solution: Lubrication of the sunroof tracks and seals. In some cases, the sunroof motor or mechanism may need to be repaired or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Navigation/MMI System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Multi Media Interface (MMI) system may freeze, crash, or exhibit other software glitches. Navigation may fail to load or provide inaccurate directions.
    * Solution: Software update or replacement of the MMI control unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Audi A5 is a desirable vehicle with a sporty design and enjoyable driving dynamics. However, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues that can affect this model year. The most serious issues include excessive oil consumption in the 2.0L engine, carbon buildup in the 3.2L engine, and potential problems with the CVT transmission. Electrical issues and suspension component wear are also common concerns. Repair costs can be significant, especially for engine and transmission work. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
