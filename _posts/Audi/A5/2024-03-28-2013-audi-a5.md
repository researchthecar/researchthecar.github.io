**Introduction:**
The 2013 Audi A5 offers a blend of performance and luxury with its sleek coupe design. It comes with two engine options: a 2.0L TFSI inline-4 and a 3.0L TFSI V6. The 2.0L engine produces 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0L engine generates 272 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners praise the A5's sporty handling, comfortable interior, and stylish design, while some express concerns about its high maintenance costs and limited rear seat space.

**Engine**
**2.0L TFSI I4**

Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
- **Carbon buildup on intake valves:** Over time, carbon deposits can accumulate on the intake valves, restricting airflow and causing performance issues. Symptoms include reduced power, engine hesitation, and increased emissions. Requires cleaning or replacement of the intake valves. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,500+
