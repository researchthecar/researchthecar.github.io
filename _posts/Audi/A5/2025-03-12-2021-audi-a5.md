The base engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, designated as the 40 TFSI, producing 201 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. An upgraded version of the same engine, designated as the 45 TFSI, produces 261 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission and come standard with Quattro all-wheel drive. The A5 is praised for its elegant design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving dynamics. However, some owners have reported issues with the infotainment system and occasional electrical glitches. Some consumers have also complained about the high cost of ownership and repairs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder (40 TFSI & 45 TFSI)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption (Primarily 45 TFSI)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings on the dashboard. Some may also experience blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The solution depends on the severity. In some cases, changing to a different viscosity oil may help. More severe cases may require replacement of piston rings or even engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $7000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly at low speeds. Others have noted hesitation during acceleration, as the transmission struggles to find the correct gear.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can resolve the issue. Other times, a transmission fluid flush may help. In more severe cases, clutch pack replacement or valve body replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (software update) - $5000+ (major repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) infotainment system may occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Restarting the system is a temporary fix. A software update from the dealership is the recommended solution. If the system continues to crash, the MMI unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1200+ (MMI unit replacement).
