### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi A5 presents a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its naturally aspirated and supercharged engines. However, the 2.0L TFSI engine is known for potential oil consumption and timing chain issues, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions, especially the S tronic dual-clutch, can experience clutch wear. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and power window failures, are also noted. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance and repair costs typical of a premium European vehicle, and pay close attention to the specific engine and transmission fitted to any model under consideration.
