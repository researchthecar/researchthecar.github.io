### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi A5 presents a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its manual transmission variants. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the gasoline engines, specifically oil consumption and timing chain concerns with the 2.0L TFSI, and potential DPF issues with the 2.0L TDI diesel. Automatic transmissions, especially the dual-clutch S tronic, can experience clutch pack wear. Electrical gremlins, such as MMI system glitches and headlight ballast failures, are also noted. While the suspension and exterior are typically robust, the convertible mechanism on the Cabriolet can be a source of repair costs. Overall, the A5 is a desirable car, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific powertrain and electrical components that may require attention.
