The 2015 Audi A5 Quattro is a stylish and sporty coupe or convertible that offers a blend of luxury and performance. It was offered with a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its sleek design, comfortable interior, and agile handling. However, some common complaints include higher maintenance costs compared to other vehicles in its class, potential electrical issues, and the occasional oil consumption concern with the engine.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can be a gradual process, becoming more noticeable as the vehicle ages. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil more frequently than expected.
    *   Solution:  The Audi technical service bulletin (TSB) addresses oil consumption issues.  Some dealerships may perform an oil consumption test to assess the severity. Repairs can range from replacing the PCV valve and breather hoses to piston ring replacement which is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, unusual whining or whistling noises from the engine bay, and/or a check engine light. This could be due to a failed turbocharger or wastegate.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm turbocharger failure, followed by turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. Some owners have also reported rough or jerky shifts.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid change. If that doesn't resolve the issue, further diagnosis may reveal valve body issues or internal wear requiring more extensive repairs. Replacement of the valve body or a transmission rebuild/replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Can lead to reduced handling precision and stability.
    *   Solution: Inspection of suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings). Replacement of worn or damaged bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the specific bushing and labor)
