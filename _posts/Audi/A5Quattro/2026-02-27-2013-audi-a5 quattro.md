### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Audi A5 Quattro is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly with its Quattro system providing excellent all-weather traction. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the 2.0L TFSI engine, specifically concerning oil consumption and timing chain tensioner longevity, which can lead to significant repair costs if not proactively managed. The automatic transmissions, particularly the Tiptronic, can experience mechatronic unit failures. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and tail light LED failures, are also noted. While the manual transmission and V6 engines appear more robust in terms of documented issues, potential buyers should be aware of these specific concerns and factor in potential maintenance costs, especially for higher-mileage examples.
