The 2012 Audi A5 Quattro is a stylish and sporty coupe or convertible, known for its sleek design, refined interior, and engaging driving experience. The most common engine option is the 2.0L turbocharged inline-4, which produces 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A less common but more powerful option is the 3.2L V6. The 2.0T models are generally well-regarded for their fuel efficiency and adequate power, while some owners appreciate the extra power of the V6. Common complaints revolve around potential oil consumption issues with the 2.0T engine, and reliability concerns are present in general. Many owners praise the A5's aesthetics and handling, but can be frustrated by higher repair costs and the complexity of the vehicle's systems.
