The 2009 Audi A5 Quattro is a stylish and sporty coupe known for its elegant design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience. The 2009 model year offered several engine options, including a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2-liter V6 engine generating approximately 265 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission (depending on the engine). Owners generally appreciate the A5's refined handling, luxurious features, and attractive styling. Common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with electrical components and the potential for costly repairs. The A5 has a timing chain on the 2.0T engine that is known to stretch over time and needs to be replaced, which can be very costly.
