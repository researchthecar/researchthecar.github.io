The 2018 Audi A5 Quattro is a stylish and sporty coupe, sedan (Sportback), and convertible known for its sleek design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience. The most common engine is the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, producing 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. While praised for its aesthetics, handling, and technology, some owners have reported issues. What some owners dislike is the relatively high cost of maintenance and some occasional electronic glitches. The other available engine for the S5 trim is a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6, producing 354 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an automatic transmission, either a 7-speed dual-clutch for the A5 or an 8-speed automatic for the S5.

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored closely.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and potentially replacing piston rings or valve seals if the consumption is severe. A compression test can help diagnose the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and required repairs)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turbocharger failure can manifest as a loss of power, unusual noises (whining, screeching), and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger. Inspecting oil lines for blockages to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
