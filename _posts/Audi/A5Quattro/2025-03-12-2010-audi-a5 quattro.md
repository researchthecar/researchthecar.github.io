The 2010 Audi A5 Quattro is a stylish and sporty coupe or convertible known for its sleek design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience. The 2010 model year offers two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L V6 generating 265 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Common owner praises include the car's handling, aesthetics, and luxurious feel. Dissatisfactions often revolve around repair costs, some reliability concerns, and the relatively small rear seats in the coupe version.
