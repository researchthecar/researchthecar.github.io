Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2016 Audi A5 Quattro, formatted for your website.

The 2016 Audi A5 Quattro is a stylish and sporty coupe or convertible known for its elegant design, refined interior, and balanced driving dynamics. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the A5's aesthetics, comfortable ride, and responsive handling. Some common dislikes include the relatively small rear seats (especially in the coupe), limited cargo space, and potentially costly maintenance. It's important to note that this analysis primarily focuses on the 2.0L turbo engine and automatic transmission as they were the most common configuration for the 2016 A5 Quattro.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (220 hp/258 lb-ft)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption is a common complaint. Owners report needing to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil pressure light illuminating or noticing a significant drop in the oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: The most common fix is replacing the piston rings. Some owners have also reported success with replacing the PCV valve, although this is less common. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are a known issue, often stemming from the water pump, thermostat housing, or coolant hoses. Symptoms include a low coolant level warning, visible coolant puddles under the car, or a sweet smell emanating from the engine bay. Overheating can occur if the leak is significant.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty water pump, thermostat housing, or leaking coolant hoses. Thorough inspection of the entire cooling system is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner, particularly earlier versions, can fail, leading to timing chain slack. This can cause rough running, misfires, and, if left unaddressed, potentially catastrophic engine damage. A rattling noise upon startup is a common warning sign.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner, timing chain, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can manifest as a noticeable jolt or hesitation during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update might alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit (valve body) can fail. Symptoms include harsh or erratic shifting, inability to shift into certain gears, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the mechatronic unit, or rebuilding/replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings are a common issue, leading to clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Handling can also become less precise.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, and general unresponsiveness can plague the navigation/infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software updates sometimes resolve the issue. In other cases, the entire unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) - $1,500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can leave the car unable to start, especially after sitting for a few days. This can be caused by parasitic draws from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw (e.g., faulty module, improperly installed aftermarket accessories). Replacing the battery may also be necessary if it has been repeatedly drained.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation buildup inside the headlight housings is a common complaint. This can reduce headlight output and potentially damage the headlight assembly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlight housing or attempting to reseal the existing housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (per headlight)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can fail, leading to difficulty opening or closing the sunroof, or a rattling noise.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the sunroof motor, track, or entire assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Audi A5 Quattro, while a desirable vehicle, can present owners with some notable issues. The most concerning are the potential for oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failure in the 2.0L engine, both of which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also relatively common. Suspension and transmission problems, while less frequent, can also contribute to higher ownership costs. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchase decision, and meticulously check for any symptoms during a pre-purchase inspection.
