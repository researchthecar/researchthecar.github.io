The 2013 Audi A5 Quattro is a sporty coupe and convertible known for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience thanks to its standard all-wheel drive. The most common engine is the 2.0L turbocharged inline-4, producing 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque.  Some people find the infotainment system dated compared to newer models, and others feel the rear seats are cramped. The alternative engine option is the 3.0L supercharged V6 available on the S5 model, producing 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission, depending on the model and trim.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report high oil consumption, sometimes requiring a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and frequent oil top-ups. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be noticeable.
    *   Solution: Audi issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) and, in some cases, extended warranty coverage for piston ring replacement. Replacing the piston rings with an updated design can resolve the issue. A compression test can help determine if the piston rings are the source of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ depending on the shop and severity of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to a loose timing chain. This can cause rattling noises upon start-up, rough idling, and potentially catastrophic engine damage if the chain jumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and potentially the sprockets is the recommended solution. Newer redesigned tensioners are available that address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Supercharged V6**

*   **Supercharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Supercharger failure can manifest as a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or rattling) from the engine bay, and potentially illumination of the check engine light. Internal components of the supercharger can wear out over time.
    *   Solution: Supercharger rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**
*   No Issues Found

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**
*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit, which controls the transmission's shifting, can experience failures. This can lead to harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, and potentially getting stuck in a specific gear. Diagnostic trouble codes related to the transmission control system may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the mechatronic unit, including valve body components. A transmission fluid flush and filter change should also be performed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can also lead to imprecise steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light are common symptoms. A diagnostic scan will typically reveal codes related to specific cylinders misfiring.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils. It's often recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time to ensure consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on how many coils are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door lock actuator may fail, causing the door to not lock or unlock properly. This can be intermittent or permanent.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof motor failure, leaking, and difficulty opening or closing.
    * Solution: Replacement of the sunroof motor, repair seals, or adjustment of sunroof mechanism.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may fail to display information, flicker, or become completely unresponsive. This can be due to a faulty screen, wiring issues, or a problem with the infotainment system's control module.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the navigation screen or repair of the infotainment system's control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Audi A5 Quattro, particularly with the 2.0L engine, has some known issues to watch out for. The most concerning are the excessive oil consumption and timing chain tensioner problems, both of which can lead to significant engine damage. Electrical issues like faulty ignition coils and door lock actuators are also relatively common. The automatic transmission, if equipped, could potentially experience mechatronic unit failure. Suspension component wear is typical for a vehicle of this age, but control arm bushing failure is a notable issue. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of them and have the car thoroughly inspected before purchasing. The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage.
