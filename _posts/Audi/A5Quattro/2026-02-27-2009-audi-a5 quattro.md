## Engine

### 2.0L TFSI (Turbocharged Direct Injection)
**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil consumption, potential for fouled spark plugs, and catalytic converter damage.
- **Solution:** Piston ring replacement, PCV valve update, or engine rebuild.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,500

**Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup; potential for catastrophic engine failure if ignored.
- **Solution:** Replacement of timing chain, tensioners, guides, and seals.
- **Cost:** $1,200 - $2,500


### 3.2L FSI (Direct Injection)
**Carbon Buildup**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced engine performance, rough idling, decreased fuel efficiency.
- **Solution:** Intake valve cleaning (walnut blasting or chemical cleaning).
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

**PCV Valve Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Whistling noise from the engine, rough idle, potential oil leaks.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) valve assembly.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400

### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Audi A5 Quattro presents a compelling package of style and performance. However, potential buyers and current owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly within the engine and transmission systems. The TFSI engines are prone to oil consumption and timing chain issues, while the FSI engines can suffer from carbon buildup. Automatic transmissions, especially the S tronic, can be costly to repair if issues arise with the mechatronic unit or clutch packs. Electrical gremlins, such as MMI system glitches, are also noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential problems and ensuring a positive ownership experience.
