**Summary**

The 2014 Audi A5 Quattro can be a desirable car, but prospective buyers should be aware of the potential issues. The most concerning is the excessive oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, particularly with the MMI system, are also relatively common. Suspension and water leak problems are less frequent but can still be a source of frustration. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes, others, like engine and transmission repairs, can be quite costly. Due diligence, including a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, is highly recommended.
