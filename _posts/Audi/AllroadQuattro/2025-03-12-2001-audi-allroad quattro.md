The 2001 Audi Allroad Quattro is a unique vehicle, blending wagon practicality with all-terrain capability thanks to its adjustable air suspension and standard Quattro all-wheel drive. The most common engine option is a 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged V6, producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Some models were also available with a 2.5-liter Turbocharged Diesel engine, producing 180 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Allroad for its comfortable ride, versatile cargo space, and go-anywhere attitude. However, its complex systems, particularly the air suspension and turbocharged engine, often lead to reliability concerns and high repair costs.
