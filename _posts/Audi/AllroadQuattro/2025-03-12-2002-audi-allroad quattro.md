The 2002 Audi Allroad Quattro is a unique blend of wagon practicality and off-road capability, offering a distinctive driving experience. It came standard with a 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Allroad's adjustable air suspension, luxurious interior, and all-weather performance. However, the complex systems, especially the air suspension and turbochargers, often lead to reliability concerns and costly repairs. Dislikes often revolve around the high maintenance costs and the age of the vehicle leading to increased component failures.
