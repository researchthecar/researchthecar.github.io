The 2003 Audi Allroad Quattro is a unique blend of luxury wagon and light-duty off-roader, known for its adjustable air suspension and distinctive styling. The 2003 Allroad Quattro offers two engine options: a 2.7L twin-turbo V6 producing 250 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.2L V8 producing 300 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and all-weather capability, but common complaints revolve around the complexity of its systems, which can lead to expensive repairs, particularly with the air suspension and turbochargers.
