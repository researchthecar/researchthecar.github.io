**Summary**

The 2020 Audi S7 Sportback, while a highly desirable vehicle, does present some potential issues for owners. The most concerning issues appear to be related to the engine (turbocharger failure, oil leaks), the transmission (rough shifting, failure), and the air suspension system. These issues can be costly to repair, potentially ranging from hundreds to several thousands of dollars, depending on the severity. Electrical and interior issues, while less severe, can also be frustrating.
