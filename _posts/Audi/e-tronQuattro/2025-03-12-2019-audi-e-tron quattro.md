The 2019 Audi e-tron Quattro marked Audi's entry into the all-electric SUV market. It came exclusively with a dual-motor all-wheel-drive electric powertrain. The combined system output was 402 horsepower and 490 lb-ft of torque in boost mode. Owners generally appreciate the e-tron for its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and quiet operation.
