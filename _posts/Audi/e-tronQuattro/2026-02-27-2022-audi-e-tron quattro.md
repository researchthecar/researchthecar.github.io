# 2022 Audi e-tron Quattro

### Overview
The 2022 Audi e-tron Quattro, an all-electric luxury SUV, generally exhibits strong reliability, reflecting Audi's commitment to quality in its EV offerings. As a relatively new platform, long-term data is still accumulating, but initial reports suggest a robust build and well-integrated powertrain. The electric drivetrain, with fewer moving parts than traditional internal combustion engines, inherently reduces the potential for certain types of mechanical failures. However, like any complex vehicle, specific areas can experience issues. This analysis focuses on documented technical reliability concerns beyond standard maintenance, providing insights into potential problem areas and their associated costs for owners.
