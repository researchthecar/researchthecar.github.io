### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Audi e-tron Quattro generally exhibits good reliability, particularly concerning its core electric powertrain components. The dual electric motors and single-speed transmission have shown no significant widespread issues. However, potential owners should be aware of some reported concerns, primarily related to the adaptive air suspension, where compressor malfunctions and air spring leaks can occur, leading to costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, such as premature 12V battery failure and occasional onboard charger issues, are also noted. The infotainment system can sometimes suffer from software glitches. Despite these points, the e-tron is considered a solid entry into the luxury EV segment, with most issues being repairable and not indicative of fundamental design flaws in the electric drivetrain.
