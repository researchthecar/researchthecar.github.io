The 2023 Audi e-tron Quattro is an all-electric SUV that offers a blend of luxury, performance, and practicality. It's powered by two electric motors, one on each axle, providing all-wheel drive. The combined output is around 402 horsepower and 490 lb-ft of torque. While lauded for its comfortable ride, quick acceleration, and upscale interior, some owners have reported a few issues that are important to consider. Some common dislikes include range anxiety, charging times, and the higher price point compared to some competitors.

**Electric Motor**

*   **Motor Cooling System Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported coolant leaks originating from the electric motor cooling system. Symptoms include low coolant warnings, puddles of coolant under the vehicle, and potential overheating warnings in the vehicle's information system.
