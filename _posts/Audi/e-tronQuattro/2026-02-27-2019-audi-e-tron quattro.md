### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Audi e-tron Quattro generally exhibits good reliability, particularly concerning its electric powertrain and transmission, which are typical for EVs with fewer moving parts. However, potential owners should be aware of some specific concerns. The adaptive air suspension system has been noted for issues like compressor failures and air spring leaks, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and 12V auxiliary battery premature failures, are also reported. While not pervasive, these issues suggest that a thorough inspection of the suspension and electrical components is advisable when considering a used model. Overall, the e-tron is a solid electric vehicle, but these specific areas warrant attention for long-term ownership.
