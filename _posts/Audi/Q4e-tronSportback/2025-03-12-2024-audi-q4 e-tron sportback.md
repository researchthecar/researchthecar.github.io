The 2024 Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback is an all-electric compact SUV that blends Audi's signature luxury with modern EV technology. It's available with either a single-motor rear-wheel drive configuration or a dual-motor all-wheel drive setup. The dual-motor version generates a combined 295 horsepower and provides quicker acceleration. While owners appreciate the Q4 e-tron Sportback for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and smooth ride, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's complexity, range limitations compared to some competitors, and charging speed. Some reviewers have noted that the rear passenger space and cargo area are smaller than some competitors.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive**

*   **Reduced Power/Limp Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the vehicle suddenly entering a "limp mode" with significantly reduced power. This often occurs during periods of high demand on the battery, such as rapid acceleration or hill climbing, particularly when the battery charge is below a certain level. Diagnostic codes often point to issues with the battery management system or motor control unit.
    *   Solution: The issue typically requires a software update to the battery management system or motor control unit to optimize power distribution and prevent the car from prematurely limiting power. In some cases, a faulty battery sensor or module may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ for software update; $500 - $2000+ for sensor/module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pitched noise from Motor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported a high pitched noise coming from the motor area when the vehicle is driving or sometimes even while sitting stationary.
    *   Solution: Motor replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5000 - $10000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Single Motor Rear-Wheel Drive**

*   **Reduced Power/Limp Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the dual-motor configuration, some owners of the single-motor Q4 e-tron Sportback have experienced sudden power reduction and entry into limp mode, especially at lower battery states of charge or during demanding driving conditions.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the battery management system and motor control unit are often the first step. If the issue persists, a thorough inspection of the motor, battery pack, and related sensors is necessary, potentially leading to component replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ for software update; $500 - $2000+ for sensor/module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery/Charging System**

*   **Slow DC Fast Charging Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the actual DC fast charging speeds are often lower than the advertised maximum charging rate, especially at higher states of charge or in colder temperatures. This can significantly extend charging times during road trips.
    *   Solution: While some variation in charging speed is expected due to factors like battery temperature and charging station capabilities, a software update may improve charging performance. If the issue is consistent and significantly below expectations, the battery thermal management system or charging port may need inspection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ for software update; $500 - $1500+ for component inspection/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inaccurate Range Estimation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have found the range estimate provided by the car's computer to be inaccurate, especially in cold weather or when driving at higher speeds. This can lead to range anxiety and miscalculation of trip distances.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the battery management system may improve the accuracy of the range estimation algorithm. However, drivers should also be aware that driving style, climate, and terrain significantly affect the actual range achieved.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ for software update
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Door Sticking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the charging door failing to open or close properly. This is often due to a faulty latching mechanism or debris obstructing the door.
    *   Solution: A simple cleaning and lubrication of the latching mechanism may resolve the issue. If the latch is damaged, it will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (MMI) is sometimes prone to freezing, crashing, or exhibiting slow response times. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: A software update is often the first step. If the issue persists, the MMI unit may need to be reset or, in some cases, replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ for software update; $500 - $1500+ for MMI unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Lane Assist)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions or false alarms from parking sensors, lane assist, or other driver-assistance systems are occasionally reported.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor is needed. Replacement of the malfunctioning sensor is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the sensor and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Connectivity Issues (Bluetooth, Wireless CarPlay)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with Bluetooth connectivity, wireless Apple CarPlay, or Android Auto are reported such as device pairing failures, dropped connections, or distorted audio.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the infotainment system and phone are often required. If the problem persists, a module in the car may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ for software update; $200 - $500+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the 12V battery will drain if the vehicle is not driven frequently, causing it to not start, as well as issues with low voltage warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery and ensure the vehicle is driven frequently.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
