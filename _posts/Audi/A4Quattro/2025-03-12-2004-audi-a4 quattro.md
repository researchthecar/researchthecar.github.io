The 2004 Audi A4 Quattro is a popular compact executive car known for its sporty handling, luxurious interior, and standard all-wheel drive. It came with several engine and transmission options. One of the most common configurations is the 1.8T inline-4 engine producing 170 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options included a 3.0L V6 with 220 hp and a 6-speed manual or automatic. Common praises for the A4 include its refined interior, agile handling, and the security of quattro all-wheel drive. Criticisms often revolve around maintenance costs, potential reliability issues, and the relatively small rear seat.
