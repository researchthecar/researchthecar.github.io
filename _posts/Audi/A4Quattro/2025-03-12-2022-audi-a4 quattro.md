Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Audi A4 Quattro, organized as requested. The 2022 Audi A4 Quattro is generally well-regarded for its refined interior, comfortable ride, and responsive handling. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, offered in two states of tune: 201 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque (40 TFSI) and 261 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque (45 TFSI). A 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission is standard on all Quattro models. Some common criticisms include the somewhat conservative styling and the infotainment system's learning curve.

**Summary**

The 2022 Audi A4 Quattro, while generally a reliable vehicle, has some common issues that owners have reported. The 2.0L turbocharged engine can suffer from excessive oil consumption, which can lead to expensive repairs if left unaddressed. The S tronic transmission may exhibit rough shifting or hesitation, potentially requiring a software update or more extensive work. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions can also occur. Finally, interior and exterior build quality concerns like creaking trim and faulty door seals can be prevalent. While most of these issues aren't necessarily widespread or catastrophic, they're worth noting when considering a used 2022 A4 Quattro. The severity of the problems varies, but the potential repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage.
