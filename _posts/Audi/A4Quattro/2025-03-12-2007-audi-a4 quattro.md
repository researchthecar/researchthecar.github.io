**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Smoke from the exhaust can also be a symptom. This can eventually lead to catalytic converter failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings or the entire engine. Addressing PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system issues may help prevent further oil consumption in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, resulting in reduced acceleration and performance. Can also cause a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the diverter valve with an updated revision.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Follower Failure (High-Pressure Fuel Pump)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, rough running, and a potential check engine light. If left unaddressed, can lead to complete fuel pump failure and engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam follower and potentially the high-pressure fuel pump if damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup. Can lead to serious engine damage if the timing chain jumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. This is a labor-intensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, and reduced performance. This is due to the direct injection design of the engine.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
