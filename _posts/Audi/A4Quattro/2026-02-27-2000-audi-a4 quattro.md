### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Audi A4 Quattro offers a compelling blend of performance and all-weather capability, especially with its Quattro system. However, potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues, particularly concerning the PCV system and ignition coils on the 1.8T engine, and intake manifold issues on the V6. Automatic transmission torque converters and control modules can also be a concern. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster pixel loss, are not uncommon. While suspension components like control arm bushings may require attention, the overall chassis is generally well-regarded. Regular maintenance, especially on the timing belt, is crucial for longevity. Addressing these potential issues proactively can help maintain the A4's driving experience.
