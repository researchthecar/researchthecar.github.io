### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Audi A4 Quattro (B6) is a capable premium sedan, but like many European vehicles of this era, it requires diligent maintenance and awareness of potential issues. Common problems tend to center around the PCV system and ignition coils on the 1.8T engines, oil consumption and timing chain concerns on the 2.0T FSI, and intake manifold issues on the 3.0L V6. Automatic transmissions can develop torque converter or valve body problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and wheel bearings are also wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and ABS sensors, are not uncommon. While not inherently unreliable, owners should budget for repairs beyond standard maintenance, especially for higher-mileage examples. Regular servicing and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining this Audi.
