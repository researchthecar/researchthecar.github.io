**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (220 hp)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update might address the issue. More severe cases may require replacement of piston rings or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (software update) to $5,000+ (engine replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are a relatively common issue, often stemming from the water pump or thermostat housing. Symptoms include low coolant level, overheating, and visible coolant under the car.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty water pump or thermostat housing and potentially other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200.

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly at low speeds or during initial acceleration. Hesitation when shifting between gears is also a common complaint.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) software update may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) to $4,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit, which controls the dual-clutch system, can sometimes fail. Symptoms include difficulty shifting, inability to select gears, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Control Arm Bushings Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the front control arm bushings is common, leading to clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can also cause vague steering or vibrations.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits unused for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw. This could involve replacing a faulty module, fixing a wiring issue, or replacing the battery itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (battery replacement) to $1,000+ (diagnosing and repairing complex electrical issues).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, such as freezing, crashing, or unresponsive touch screen.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, the entire infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,500+ (infotainment unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroofs on the 2016 A4 sometimes exhibit problems like failing to open/close properly, getting stuck, or leaking water.

**Summary**

The 2016 Audi A4 Quattro, while generally a well-regarded vehicle, can be prone to certain issues. The oil consumption and coolant leak issues on the engine are relatively common and can potentially lead to costly repairs. The S tronic transmission may also present problems with rough shifting or Mechatronic unit failure. Suspension wear is normal with any car, but the A4's suspension may need servicing sooner than other cars. Finally, electrical issues range from simple battery drain to complex infotainment system problems, which can be frustrating and expensive to resolve. When considering a used 2016 A4 Quattro, a thorough inspection by a qualified mechanic is recommended to identify any potential issues and estimate repair costs.
