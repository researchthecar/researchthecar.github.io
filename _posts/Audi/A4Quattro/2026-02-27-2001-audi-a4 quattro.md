### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Audi A4 Quattro, while offering a premium experience, exhibits common issues typical for its age and German engineering. The 1.8T engine is prone to PCV system failures and ignition coil issues, while the 2.8 V6 can suffer from oil leaks. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 5-speed 01V, may develop torque converter or TCM problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also wear items. Electrically, window regulators and the instrument cluster's LCD display are known weak points. Despite these potential issues, many can be addressed with proper maintenance and timely repairs, making the A4 Quattro a viable option for those who understand its needs.
