The 2015 Audi A4 Quattro is a popular compact executive sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving dynamics. It offers a blend of luxury and performance that appeals to a wide range of drivers. Common praises include its sleek design, high-quality interior materials, and the sure-footedness of the Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Common complaints include the relatively small rear seat space, the cost of maintenance and repairs, and the sometimes-complex infotainment system. The standard engine is a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (220 HP)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil frequently between oil changes. The engine may burn more oil than usual, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be present.
    * Solution: Audi issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) addressing this issue, which may include performing an oil consumption test. Repair options range from replacing the piston rings to engine replacement, depending on the severity.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner on some 2.0T engines can fail, leading to a stretched or broken timing chain. This can cause the engine to run poorly, misfire, or even suffer catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms may include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, a check engine light with codes related to timing, and rough idling.
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, timing chain, and associated components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or delayed shifting, especially when cold. The transmission may hesitate before engaging a gear, or shift harshly between gears. This can affect the overall driving experience and potentially lead to premature wear on the transmission components.
    * Solution: A software update of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission overhaul may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $5,000+ (transmission overhaul).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: The control arm bushings, especially the lower control arms, are prone to premature wear. This can cause clunking noises from the front suspension when going over bumps, imprecise steering, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Malfunctioning MMI System**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Multi Media Interface (MMI) system can experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure. This can affect the navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    * Solution: Try resetting the MMI system. If that doesn't work, software updates or replacement of the MMI control unit may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reset) - $1,500+ (MMI control unit replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty Power Window Regulators**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate correctly, either getting stuck or failing to move at all. This is often due to a faulty window regulator motor or damaged cables.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty power window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500 per window.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Condensation can build up inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the headlight bulbs or electrical components.
    * Solution: The headlight housing needs to be removed to properly dry it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may become stuck, fail to open or close properly, or make excessive noise. This can be due to a faulty motor, damaged tracks, or debris obstructing the mechanism.
    * Solution: Inspect the sunroof tracks for debris and lubricate them. If the motor is faulty, replace it. Damaged tracks may require replacement of the entire sunroof assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (cleaning/lubrication) - $1,000+ (sunroof assembly replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Audi A4 Quattro has some known issues, particularly with the 2.0L turbocharged engine, including excessive oil consumption and timing chain tensioner problems. Electrical issues, such as MMI system malfunctions and power window regulator failures, can also occur. The suspension can also experience issues related to premature control arm bushing wear. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly, with engine-related problems potentially being the most expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and have a thorough inspection performed before purchasing a used 2015 Audi A4 Quattro.
