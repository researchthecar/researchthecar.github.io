### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Audi A4 Quattro is a capable luxury sedan with a generally good reputation, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 2.0L TFSI engine is prone to oil consumption and timing chain issues, while the 3.2L FSI can experience timing chain wear. Automatic transmissions, particularly the Tiptronic and S tronic, may require attention for mechatronic unit or clutch pack issues.
