### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Audi A4 Quattro (B7) is a capable and enjoyable vehicle, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 2.0T engine is prone to oil consumption and timing chain-related problems, while the 3.2L V6 can also suffer from timing chain issues. Automatic transmissions may develop problems with the mechatronic unit or torque converter. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and ABS sensors, can also arise. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning oil levels and timing components, is crucial for mitigating these potential reliability concerns and ensuring the longevity of the vehicle.
