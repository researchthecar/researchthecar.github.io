The 2009 Audi A4 Quattro is a popular luxury sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and all-wheel-drive capability. The base engine for the 2009 A4 Quattro is a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A 3.2L V6 engine, producing 265 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque was also available. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic (Tiptronic), and a continuously variable transmission (CVT, available only with front-wheel drive models). Owners often praise the A4's handling and interior quality, but some common complaints include reliability issues and the cost of maintenance.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **High Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Can be indicated by the low oil pressure light coming on.
    *   Solution: Potential solutions range from replacing the PCV valve and performing an oil consumption test to more extensive repairs like piston ring replacement or even engine replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (PCV Valve) - $5,000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, particularly in colder temperatures. Can eventually lead to catastrophic engine damage if the timing chain jumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and potentially other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when the engine is cold. Can lead to reduced engine performance or engine failure if not addressed. These engines have a multi-chain timing system and can require extensive repair.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chains, tensioners, and guides. This is a complex and labor-intensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Tiptronic)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during gear changes, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Premature Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping, shuddering, or hesitation during acceleration. Erratic shifting behavior. Complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: CVT replacement is typically the only viable solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose or imprecise steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings. In some cases, it may be more cost-effective to replace the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and reduced engine power. Check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Central Convenience Control Module Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent issues with power windows, door locks, interior lighting, and alarm system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause. May require replacement of the central convenience control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Housing Cracking/Yellowing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlight lenses become cloudy or yellowed, reducing light output and visibility. Cracks may appear in the housing.
    *   Solution: Polishing the headlight lenses (temporary fix). Headlight housing replacement for more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 (Polishing) / $300 - $1,000+ (Replacement per headlight)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Climate Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blower motor malfunction, temperature fluctuations, or failure to properly regulate the cabin temperature.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty component. Potential repairs include replacing the blower motor, blower motor resistor, or climate control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Audi A4 Quattro, while a desirable vehicle in terms of styling and driving experience, has several known issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly high oil consumption and timing chain problems, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the CVT, can also lead to significant expenses. Suspension and electrical problems can add to the overall cost of ownership. The severity of these issues varies, but addressing them can often require substantial investment.
