### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Audi A4 Quattro offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 2.0L TFSI engine is prone to issues like PCV valve failure, timing chain wear, and significant oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. The 3.2L V6 also has documented timing chain issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 6-speed, can experience mechatronic unit failures. Electrical gremlins, such as MMI system glitches and electric water pump failures, are also noted. While the manual transmission and suspension systems are generally robust, the engine and transmission are the primary areas requiring attention. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a history of diligent maintenance are crucial for mitigating these potential reliability challenges.
