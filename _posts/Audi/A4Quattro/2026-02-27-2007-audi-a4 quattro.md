- **Solution:** Rebuild or replacement of the torque converter.
- **Cost:** $1000 - $2500

**Valve Body Problems**
- **Symptoms:** Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, transmission fault codes.
- **Solution:** Repair or replacement of the transmission valve body.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1800


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering feel, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**Wheel Bearing Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Humming or grinding noise that increases with speed, especially when turning.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the faulty wheel bearing.
- **Cost:** $250 - $500


## Electrical

### General Electrical System
**Window Regulator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows not operating, slow window movement, grinding noise from door.

### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Audi A4 Quattro is a capable vehicle, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues, particularly with the 2.0L TFSI engine's oil consumption and PCV system, and potential timing chain problems on both engines. Automatic transmission issues, especially with the torque converter and valve body, are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings and wheel bearings can wear out. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and ignition coils, are not uncommon. While the exterior is generally robust, interior issues like HVAC resistors and sunroof drains can arise. Proactive maintenance and addressing these known faults early can significantly improve the long-term reliability and ownership experience.
