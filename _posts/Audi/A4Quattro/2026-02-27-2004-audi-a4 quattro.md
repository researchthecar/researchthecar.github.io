### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Audi A4 Quattro, while offering a compelling driving experience, presents several common reliability concerns typical for its age and German engineering. The 2.0L TFSI engine is prone to oil consumption and timing chain issues, while the 3.0L V6 can suffer from intake manifold and coolant leaks. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 01J, may develop torque converter or valve body problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts are also wear items. Electrically, window regulators, ignition coils, and ABS sensors are known to fail. Interior issues like pixelated displays and exterior concerns such as headlight condensation are also reported. Despite these potential issues, many A4s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and timely repairs, especially those with the manual transmission and well-maintained engines.
