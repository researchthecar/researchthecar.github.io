The 2002 Audi A4 Quattro is a compact executive car known for its refined driving experience and available all-wheel-drive system. The A4 Quattro offered several engine and transmission options including a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 engine which produced around 170 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L V6 engine with approximately 220 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual (only with the 3.0L), and a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the A4's upscale interior and responsive handling, but common complaints revolve around reliability issues and relatively high maintenance costs compared to other vehicles in its class.

**Engine**

**1.8L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **Sludge Buildup**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 1.8T engine is prone to oil sludge buildup if oil changes are not performed regularly with the correct synthetic oil. This can lead to oil starvation, turbocharger failure, and ultimately engine damage. Symptoms include low oil pressure warning light, rough running engine, and unusual engine noises.
    * Solution: Regular oil changes (every 5,000 miles) with high-quality synthetic oil. Oil pan removal and cleaning to remove existing sludge. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coil Pack Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coil packs are prone to failure, leading to misfires and a rough-running engine. This is characterized by a flashing check engine light, poor acceleration, and the engine running unevenly.
    * Solution: Replace faulty coil packs. It's often recommended to replace all coil packs at once for preventative maintenance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400.
