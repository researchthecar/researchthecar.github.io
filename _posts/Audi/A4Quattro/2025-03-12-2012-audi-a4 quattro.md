**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (TFSI)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.0 TFSI engine in the 2012 A4 Quattro is known for excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, a low oil warning light illuminating, and potential blue smoke from the exhaust. This issue can stem from faulty piston rings, which are prone to allowing oil to seep into the combustion chamber.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to replace the piston rings with an updated design. Some owners have also opted to replace the entire engine block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the timing chain tensioner can lead to catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise at startup, especially when the engine is cold. If left unaddressed, the timing chain can skip teeth, causing valve damage and potentially destroying the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and potentially other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve failure can cause a multitude of issues, including rough idling, oil leaks, increased oil consumption, and a check engine light. A faulty PCV valve can cause vacuum leaks and pressure imbalances within the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the PCV valve assembly. In some cases, the entire valve cover needs to be replaced as the PCV valve is integrated into it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Tiptronic)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can manifest as a noticeable clunk or jerk when the transmission shifts.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and adaptation reset can resolve the issue. However, more severe cases might require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush & reset) - $4,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can also lead to vague steering and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate properly, becoming slow or completely inoperable. This is often due to a failed window regulator motor or a broken cable within the regulator assembly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+
        *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Interior Lighting Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dome lights, map lights, or other interior lights may flicker or fail to illuminate. This can be caused by faulty bulbs, wiring issues, or a problem with the central control module.
    * Solution: Replacing the bulbs or repairing the wiring. If the central control module is the issue, it may need to be reprogrammed or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation. This can reduce headlight output and potentially damage the headlight components.
    *   Solution: Resealing the headlight housings or replacing the headlights.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation or infotainment system may experience freezing, crashing, or other malfunctions. The screen might become unresponsive, or the system may fail to boot up at all.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. However, more severe cases might require replacement of the infotainment system unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Audi A4 Quattro, while a well-regarded luxury sedan, has several documented issues. The most significant and potentially costly issues revolve around the 2.0 TFSI engine, particularly excessive oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failure. Transmission problems can also be expensive to address. Other common issues, such as suspension and electrical problems, tend to be less severe but can still add to the overall cost of ownership. Buyers considering a 2012 Audi A4 Quattro should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and condition prior to purchase.
