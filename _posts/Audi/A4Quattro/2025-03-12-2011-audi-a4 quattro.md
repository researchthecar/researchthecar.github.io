**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (TFSI)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.0T engine is notorious for consuming excessive amounts of oil, sometimes exceeding 1 quart every 1,000 miles (or less). This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and frequent oil top-offs. Symptoms include the low oil level light illuminating, bluish smoke from the exhaust (especially on startup or acceleration), and a noticeable drop in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: The issue often stems from faulty piston rings and/or PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve. The updated piston ring design is intended to resolve excessive oil consumption. Replacing the PCV valve is also a common remedy. Perform an oil consumption test.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: PCV valve replacement $200 - $500. Piston ring replacement can range from $3,000 - $6,000+ due to the extensive labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to timing chain slack. This can cause the chain to jump teeth, resulting in severe engine damage, including bent valves and piston damage. Symptoms may include a rattling noise upon startup (especially when cold), a check engine light, and rough running.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and related components is the recommended fix. Use the updated tensioner design (revision level is critical).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on if the engine has internal damage from a jumped chain
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HPFP can fail, leading to fuel delivery problems. Symptoms include difficulty starting, rough idling, loss of power, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (Tiptronic)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit (the transmission control unit) is a common point of failure. Symptoms include harsh or delayed shifting, erratic gear selection, transmission slipping, and being stuck in a gear. A check engine light may also illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Mechatronic unit or rebuilding the valve body within the Mechatronic unit. Some shops can reprogram or reflash the existing unit, but this is not always a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair method (replacement vs. rebuild/reprogram).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The control arm bushings, particularly on the front suspension, are prone to wear and tear. This leads to clunking noises when going over bumps, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power window regulators can fail, causing the window to move erratically, slowly, or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires and a rough-running engine. A check engine light will often illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the ignition coils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500 for a set of 4 coils
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can fail, causing it to become stuck open or closed, or to leak.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, track, or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system can experience glitches, freezes, and failures. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle settings.
    *   Solution: Software update, component replacement, or complete system replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (for software update) to $1,500+ (for component/system replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Audi A4 Quattro, while offering a premium driving experience, can suffer from some notable issues. The most prevalent is the 2.0T engine's tendency for excessive oil consumption, which can be a costly repair. Timing chain issues, and Mechatronic failures in the automatic transmission are also potential concerns. Electrical problems and suspension wear are also common. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering this vehicle. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
