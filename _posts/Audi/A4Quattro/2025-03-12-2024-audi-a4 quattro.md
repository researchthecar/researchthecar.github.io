Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2024 Audi A4 Quattro, presented in the requested format.

The 2024 Audi A4 is a popular compact luxury sedan known for its refined driving experience, sophisticated interior, and advanced technology. The A4 offers a blend of comfort and performance that appeals to a wide range of drivers. It is generally well-regarded for its handling and overall build quality, but, like any vehicle, it's not without its potential issues. The 2024 A4 comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. A less powerful version of the engine produces 201 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. The version we're focusing on here produces 261 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. Some drivers find the infotainment system a bit complex to use, and the rear seat space can be a bit tight for taller passengers.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (261 hp)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, the need to add oil regularly (e.g., every 1,000-3,000 miles), and potentially visible blue smoke from the exhaust in severe cases.
    *   Solution: A dealership should perform an oil consumption test to quantify the issue. If excessive consumption is confirmed, potential repairs include replacing piston rings, valve stem seals, or even the entire engine in extreme cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $8,000+ depending on the repair needed
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the engine compartment, loss of power, check engine light illumination, and potentially black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty turbocharger. Diagnose associated components (e.g., oil lines, wastegate) to ensure proper function after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Hesitation or Jerking During Low-Speed Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation, rough shifting, or jerking sensations, especially during upshifts or downshifts at low speeds (e.g., in stop-and-go traffic).
    *   Solution: A software update for the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a transmission fluid flush or replacement of the mechatronic unit (valve body) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension when driving over bumps, uneven tire wear, and a generally less controlled ride. This may involve worn control arm bushings, ball joints, or struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Inspect the suspension components for wear and replace as needed. An alignment should be performed after any suspension work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ per corner, depending on the parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or unresponsiveness of the infotainment system. Random reboots, connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, and malfunctioning touch screen.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. Ensure the software is up-to-date. If problems persist, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alarms, failure to detect objects, or error messages related to parking sensors or blind spot monitoring systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is malfunctioning using a scan tool. Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling or Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling sounds emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear deck, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle. Applying felt tape or other sound-dampening materials can often resolve the issue. Tightening loose trim pieces may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the repair and whether a professional is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Audi A4 Quattro, while generally reliable, can exhibit issues related to its engine, transmission, electrical system, and suspension. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely. Owners should be aware of potential oil consumption issues, turbocharger failures, and transmission quirks, as these can lead to expensive repairs. Electrical glitches and suspension component wear are also potential concerns. By being proactive with maintenance and addressing any issues promptly, owners can help ensure a more reliable ownership experience.
