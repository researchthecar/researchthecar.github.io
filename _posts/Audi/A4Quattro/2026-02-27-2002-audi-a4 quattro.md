### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Audi A4 Quattro is a capable vehicle, but its age means certain components are prone to failure. Common issues revolve around the PCV system and ignition coils on the 1.8T engine, oil consumption on the 2.0T, and timing chain tensioners on V6 models. Automatic transmissions can develop torque converter or valve body problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also wear items. Electrically, window regulators and ABS sensors are notable weak points. While not overwhelmingly problematic, owners should be prepared for potential repairs, particularly concerning the engine and transmission, and factor in the cost of maintenance for these premium components.
