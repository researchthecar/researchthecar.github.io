The 2021 Audi A4 Quattro is a popular luxury sedan known for its refined driving experience, stylish interior, and advanced technology. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, producing 201 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque in the 40 TFSI configuration or 261 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque in the 45 TFSI configuration. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission and standard Quattro all-wheel drive. Some owners praise the A4 for its comfortable ride, responsive handling, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include the relatively small rear seats and the potential for costly repairs due to the complexity of the vehicle's systems.
