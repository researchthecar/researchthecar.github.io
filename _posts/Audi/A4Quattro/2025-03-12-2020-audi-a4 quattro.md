**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder (188 hp / 248 hp)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption (248 hp version)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. The amount of oil usage varies.
    * Solution: In some cases, Audi has performed oil consumption tests and, if deemed excessive, has replaced piston rings or other engine components. However, determining the root cause can be challenging.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $7,000+ (depending on the extent of repairs)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points, including the water pump, thermostat housing, and hoses. You may notice a coolant smell, low coolant level warning, or visible leaks.
    * Solution: Identify and replace the leaking component. Pressure testing the system can help pinpoint the source.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the location and complexity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Hesitation or Jerking During Low-Speed Acceleration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience hesitation or jerky movements when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This is often described as the transmission being "unsure" of which gear to select.
    * Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may improve shifting behavior. In some cases, a clutch replacement or mechatronic unit repair might be necessary, but this is less common.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (for software update) - $4,000+ (for clutch/mechatronic repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Audi A4 Quattro, while generally reliable, has some reported issues. The most significant potential problems revolve around excessive oil consumption in the higher-output 2.0T engine, transmission quirks with the dual-clutch system, and electrical glitches in the MMI system or with various sensors. Oil consumption issues can be expensive to fix. Addressing transmission issues early can prevent further damage. While not all A4s will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of them and check for any symptoms during inspection and test drives.
