**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often exceeding 1 quart every 1,000 miles. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present. This is often associated with a faulty PCV valve.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the PCV valve is a common fix. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (PCV valve), $2,500+ (piston rings)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Follower Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, loss of power, and potential fuel pump failure. This is caused by the cam follower wearing through, leading to damage to the camshaft lobe that operates the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam follower and potentially the high-pressure fuel pump and camshaft. Regular inspection of the cam follower is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, reduced engine performance, and potential check engine light. The diverter valve recirculates excess boost pressure to prevent turbocharger surge.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the diverter valve. Upgraded aftermarket valves are available for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Tiptronic)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, and potential transmission failure. This is due to wear and tear on the valve body components, leading to improper fluid pressure control.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild. In some cases, transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and imprecise handling. The rubber bushings in the control arms degrade over time, leading to excessive play.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the control arms or just the bushings themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Convenience Control Module Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as malfunctioning power windows, door locks, interior lighting, and alarm system. The convenience control module manages these functions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the convenience control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, and rough engine running. Oxygen sensors monitor the exhaust gases to ensure proper air-fuel mixture.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock not working properly, unable to lock/unlock the door with the key fob or manually.
    *   Solution: Door lock actuator replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaches from the backing board and sags down, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headliner fabric or the entire headliner assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
