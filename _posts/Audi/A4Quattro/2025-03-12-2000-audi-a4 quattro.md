**Engine**

**1.8L Turbo Inline-4 (AEB, ATW, AWM)**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil sludge accumulation due to inadequate crankcase ventilation and small oil capacity. This can lead to oil starvation, turbocharger failure, and ultimately engine failure. Symptoms include low oil pressure, illuminated oil light, rough running, and eventually complete engine stoppage.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and larger capacity oil filter upgrade. Installation of an updated PCV system to improve crankcase ventilation. Engine flush may be necessary if sludge is already present, but it can also loosen debris that clogs oil passages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV valve replacement), $100 - $300 (Engine flush), $500+ (Turbocharger replacement due to oil starvation), $3,000+ (Engine replacement if severely damaged)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Temperature Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty coolant temperature sensor leading to inaccurate temperature readings, causing poor fuel economy, rough idling, difficulty starting, and potential overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the coolant temperature sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure (Turbocharged engines)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The diverter valve recirculates excess boost pressure to prevent compressor surge when the throttle is closed. If it fails, you may experience a loss of power, boost leaks, and a fluttering or whooshing sound during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the diverter valve. Upgraded aftermarket valves are often recommended for increased reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking and deterioration of vacuum lines can cause leaks that affect engine performance. Symptoms include rough idle, poor acceleration, and increased fuel consumption.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace all vacuum lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the number and location of leaks.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L V6 (AHA, ATQ)**

*   **Timing Belt Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Timing belts can stretch and/or break, especially if neglected. A snapped belt can lead to catastrophic engine damage. Signs can include increased engine noise or degraded engine performance.
    * Solution: Timely replacement of the timing belt, tensioner, idler pulleys, and water pump is essential.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+ for a full timing belt service.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, often dripping onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual (012)**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, or complete clutch failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing. Resurfacing or replacing the flywheel is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (01V)**

*   **Transmission Slippage and Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, and overall erratic transmission behavior.
    *   Solution: Often caused by low transmission fluid level or degraded fluid. A fluid and filter change may help in some cases. More serious issues may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (Fluid and filter change), $800 - $2000+ (Valve body repair/replacement), $2,500 - $4,500+ (Transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
    *No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front suspension control arm bushings wear out, leading to clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 per control arm, depending on whether just the bushings or the entire arm is replaced and whether it's DIY or professional installation.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Tie Rod End Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Worn tie rod ends can lead to steering instability, wandering, and vibrations.
    * Solution: Replacement of the tie rod ends and wheel alignment.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, often due to broken plastic clips within the regulator.
