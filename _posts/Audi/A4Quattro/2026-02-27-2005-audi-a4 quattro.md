### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Audi A4 Quattro is a capable vehicle, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 2.0T engine is prone to oil consumption and PCV problems, while the 3.2L V6 can suffer from timing chain tensioner failures. Automatic transmissions may develop issues with the torque converter or valve body. Suspension components like control arm bushings and wheel bearings are also common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and ABS sensors, can occur. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these issues require attention and can lead to significant repair costs if neglected. Regular maintenance and prompt addressing of early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the reliability of this generation A4.
