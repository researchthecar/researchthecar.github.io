### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Audi A4 Quattro (B7) is a capable and enjoyable car, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with the 2.0L TFSI engine's oil consumption and timing chain tensioner issues, and the 3.2L FSI's timing chain complexities. Automatic transmissions can also present costly repairs related to the torque converter or valve body. Suspension components like control arm bushings and wheel bearings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and CAN bus errors, can also arise. Despite these potential issues, many A4s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to known problems. Thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
