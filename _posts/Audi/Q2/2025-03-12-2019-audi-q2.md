**Engine**

**1.0L TFSI (Three-Cylinder)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between service intervals. Symptoms may include the low oil level warning light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and topping up as needed. In severe cases, an engine inspection may be necessary to identify the cause of the excessive consumption (e.g., worn piston rings, valve seals).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil top-up) to $1,000 - $5,000+ (engine repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L TFSI (Four-Cylinder)**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure, resulting in reduced power, increased engine noise, and potential warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Ensure the replacement unit is a revised version, if applicable, to address any design flaws in the original.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L TFSI (Four-Cylinder)**

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and reduced engine power. The check engine light may illuminate. Diagnosis typically involves reading fault codes and testing individual ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty ignition coils. Replacing all coils at once is recommended to ensure consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic (Dual-Clutch)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky shifting, hesitation, difficulty engaging gears, or complete loss of drive. Warning lights related to the transmission system may appear.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the mechatronic unit (the electro-hydraulic control unit within the transmission). In some cases, a software update may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutches, particularly during acceleration, leading to reduced performance and increased engine RPM without corresponding speed increase. May also be accompanied by unusual noises during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement. This involves removing the transmission, replacing the clutch discs and pressure plate, and reassembling the unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, slow response times, and connectivity issues with smartphones or other devices.
    *   Solution: Software update for the MMI system. In some cases, a hard reset or replacement of the MMI control unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $500 - $1,500+ (MMI unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate readings from parking sensors, false alarms, or complete failure to detect obstacles.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty parking sensors. The affected sensor(s) can be identified through diagnostic testing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400 per sensor (including labor)
