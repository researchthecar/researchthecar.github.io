The 2018 Audi Q2 is a subcompact luxury crossover known for its stylish design, agile handling, and comfortable interior. Engine options for the 2018 model year include a 1.0-liter three-cylinder TFSI, a 1.4-liter four-cylinder TFSI, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder TFSI, and a 1.6-liter and 2.0-liter four-cylinder TDI diesel engine. Transmission options consist of a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic, depending on the engine and trim level.
