The 2021 Audi Q2 is a subcompact luxury crossover known for its stylish design, agile handling, and premium interior. Engine options for the 2021 model year include a range of turbocharged petrol and diesel engines, depending on the market. Let's assume we are focusing on the **1.5 TFSI petrol engine**, which produces around **150 horsepower and 250 Nm of torque**. This engine is often paired with a **7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission**. Owners often praise the Q2's comfortable ride, well-appointed cabin, and advanced technology features. Some common criticisms include the limited rear passenger space and a higher price point compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**1.5 TFSI**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between service intervals. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add oil every few thousand kilometers.
    *   Solution: The recommended fix is to monitor oil levels regularly. In severe cases, Audi may recommend a piston ring replacement, valve seal replacement, or even a complete engine overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, whistling or whining noises from the engine bay, and potential warning lights related to the turbocharger system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. The cost can vary depending on the source of the replacement part and labor rates.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic (DQ200)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, difficulty engaging gears, transmission slipping, or complete loss of drive. Warning lights on the dashboard are common. The DQ200 (0AM) transmission is known for mechatronic issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the mechatronic unit. In some cases, a software update may temporarily alleviate the problem, but it is unlikely to be a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or rough shifting, especially at low speeds. Clutch slippage under acceleration. Vibration during engagement.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is the most common solution. It's recommended to replace both clutches at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision and stability. Visible wear or cracking of the suspension bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, or slow response times from the infotainment system. Bluetooth connectivity issues. Navigation system errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates can often resolve these issues. In more severe cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.

**Summary**

The 2021 Audi Q2, particularly models equipped with the 1.5 TFSI engine and 7-speed S tronic transmission, can be prone to issues like excessive oil consumption, turbocharger problems, and mechatronic unit failures in the transmission. Suspension bushing wear and electrical glitches within the infotainment system are also notable concerns. While some issues can be addressed with software updates or relatively inexpensive repairs, more serious problems like engine or transmission overhauls can be quite costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and ensure a thorough pre-purchase inspection is performed, including checking service records for any evidence of these problems.
