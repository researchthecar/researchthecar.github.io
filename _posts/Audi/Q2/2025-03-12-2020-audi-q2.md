Okay, here is a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2020 Audi Q2, separated by categories and engine/transmission options, formatted as requested.

The 2020 Audi Q2 is a subcompact luxury crossover SUV that offers a blend of style, practicality, and technology. Engine options vary depending on the market.  Popular engines in Europe include the 1.5L TFSI petrol engine producing around 150 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. There are also diesel options like the 2.0 TDI.  Owners often praise the Q2 for its agile handling, comfortable interior, and upscale design. Common criticisms include the relatively high price compared to non-luxury competitors and potentially limited rear passenger space.

**Engine**

**1.5L TFSI (Petrol)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, especially during the break-in period or with higher mileage. This can manifest as needing to add oil more frequently between scheduled services.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive (e.g., more than 1 quart per 1,000 miles), consult an Audi dealer. Potential causes include piston ring issues or valve seal problems.  In some cases, a software update or component replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the root cause and repair needed (software update vs. engine rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, reduced power, and the engine warning light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty coil(s) and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per coil depending on labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0 TDI (Diesel)**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, especially with primarily short journeys. Symptoms include reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and a warning light.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration (often performed by a dealer), or DPF replacement if severely clogged.  Driving at higher speeds for a sustained period can sometimes clear a partially clogged DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 for forced regeneration, $1000 - $3000+ for DPF replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S Tronic (Dual-Clutch)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, hesitation, jerking during gear changes, transmission warning light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the mechatronic unit or, in some cases, a software update.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, especially in higher gears.  Jerky take-offs.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Knocking Noises from Front Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or clunking noises heard when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces, especially at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn suspension components such as sway bar links, control arm bushings, or ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system can freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently.
    *   Solution: Software update, system reset, or in severe cases, replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,500+ (unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alarms, failure to detect objects, error messages.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor(s) and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per sensor depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **LED Headlight Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Flickering, dimming, or complete failure of the LED headlights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headlight unit.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the noise and securing or replacing the offending component (e.g., clips, trim pieces).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the complexity and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Audi Q2, while generally reliable, can experience some common issues. The most concerning are related to the transmission (particularly the S Tronic's mechatronic unit), and engine oil consumption, both of which can be expensive to repair. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and suspension noises are also reported. While these issues are not necessarily universal, potential buyers should be aware of them and carefully inspect used Q2s or obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic. The severity of the problems ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
