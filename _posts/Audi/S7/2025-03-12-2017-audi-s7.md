The 2017 Audi S7 is a performance-oriented luxury sedan known for its sleek design, powerful engine, and comfortable interior. It comes standard with a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 450 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered through a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission, sending power to all 4 wheels via the quattro all-wheel-drive system. Owners typically appreciate the S7's rapid acceleration, refined handling, and luxurious amenities. However, some criticisms include the high cost of maintenance and potential for expensive repairs, especially regarding the complex engine and electronics.
