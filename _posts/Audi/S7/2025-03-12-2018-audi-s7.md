**Engine**

**4.0L Twin-Turbocharged V8**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine bay, reduced power, check engine light. Can result from oil starvation due to clogged oil lines, or simply wear and tear on the turbocharger's bearings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger. Addressing the cause of failure, such as cleaning or replacing oil lines, is critical to prevent repeat failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ depending on whether one or both turbochargers need replacement and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, low oil level warnings. Potential sources include valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, oil cooler lines and turbocharger oil lines.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket, seal, or line.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, poor fuel economy, check engine light. Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on intake valves because they lack the self-cleaning action of port fuel injection.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves by walnut blasting or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Automatic Transmission**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifting, delayed engagement, transmission slipping, failure to shift, warning lights on the dashboard. The mechatronic unit is the electronic control module for the transmission and can fail due to overheating, contamination, or electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuilding of the Mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, especially in higher gears; jerky engagement; difficulty shifting; unusual noises from the transmission. The dual-clutch system can experience wear, especially with aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle sits lower than normal, especially on one side; the air suspension warning light is illuminated; the compressor runs constantly or not at all; noise from the compressor area.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor. Checking for and repairing air leaks in the system is crucial to prevent premature compressor failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, air hissing sound, rough ride. The air bladders within the struts can develop leaks over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+ per strut (labor and parts).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system freezes, reboots unexpectedly, or becomes unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, replacement of the MMI control unit might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1,500+ (for control unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is parked for extended periods. Can be due to a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
