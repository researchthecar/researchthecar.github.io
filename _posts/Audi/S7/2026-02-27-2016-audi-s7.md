### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Audi S7 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, with a generally strong reliability record. The 4.0L V8 engine is robust, though potential issues like oil leaks and PCV system problems can arise, requiring attention. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission is generally reliable but can experience issues with the mechatronics unit or clutch packs, especially with higher mileage or aggressive use. The adaptive air suspension, while offering superior comfort and adjustability, is more prone to leaks and sensor issues than the standard sport suspension. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and LED lighting, are not uncommon. Overall, the S7 is a well-built performance car, but owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs associated with its advanced systems and performance-oriented nature.
