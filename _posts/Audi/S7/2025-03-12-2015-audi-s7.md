The 2015 Audi S7 is a luxury performance sedan known for its sleek design, powerful engine, and comfortable interior. The S7 came standard with a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 450 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. It was paired exclusively with a seven-speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. Owners often praise the S7 for its acceleration, handling, and overall driving experience. Some common dislikes include the high cost of maintenance and potential reliability issues, as well as the sometimes-complicated infotainment system.

**Engine**

**4.0L Twin-Turbocharged V8 TFSI**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the engine, loss of power, check engine light illuminated, potentially accompanied by smoke from the exhaust. Internal damage to the turbocharger unit can be due to oil starvation or component failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger unit and related components. Thorough inspection of the oil supply system to the turbochargers is also necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Separator/PCV Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, oil leaks, excessive oil consumption, check engine light illuminated, and potential whistling noise from the engine. The PCV valve (positive crankcase ventilation) regulates crankcase pressure, and its failure can lead to various issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the PCV valve/oil separator assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant levels, overheating, visible coolant leaks, sweet smell from the engine compartment. Leaks can occur at various locations, including the water pump, coolant hoses, or the thermostat housing.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the coolant leak. This may involve replacing hoses, gaskets, or the water pump itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on location and component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S-Tronic Dual-Clutch (DL501)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, difficulty shifting into certain gears, transmission warning light illuminated, complete loss of drive. The Mechatronic unit is the control module for the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the Mechatronic unit. Requires specialized tools and knowledge.

**Summary**

The 2015 Audi S7, while a high-performing and luxurious vehicle, is prone to certain issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine, particularly turbocharger failure and oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. The transmission's dual-clutch system can also present problems with the Mechatronic unit and clutch wear. Electrical gremlins and air suspension issues (if equipped) are also potential areas of concern. Overall, the potential repair costs for these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, making it important for prospective buyers to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with Audi vehicles.
