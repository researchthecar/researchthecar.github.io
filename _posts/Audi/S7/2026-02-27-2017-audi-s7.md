### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Audi S7 is a reliable performance vehicle with a strong overall track record. The primary areas that may require attention beyond routine maintenance include potential oil leaks and turbocharger issues on the 4.0L V8 engine, and mechatronics unit or clutch pack concerns with the S tronic transmission. The adaptive air suspension can also be a source of repair costs due to potential leaks or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are not uncommon in modern Audis. Exterior lighting, specifically LED headlights, and interior climate control components like the blower motor are also noted, though less frequently. Despite these potential issues, the S7 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, with most owners experiencing dependable operation when these specific components are addressed proactively.
