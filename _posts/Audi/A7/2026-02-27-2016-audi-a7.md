### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Audi A7 offers a compelling blend of style and performance, with generally good mechanical reliability. The powertrain options, particularly the supercharged 3.0L TFSI, are robust, though some owners have reported issues like oil consumption or timing chain wear on the 2.0L TFSI. Transmission reliability is decent, but the dual-clutch S tronic can be prone to clutch pack wear and mechatronic issues. Electrical gremlins, especially with the MMI system and potential battery drains, are the most commonly cited non-routine problems. Optional air suspension systems can also present costly repair needs. Overall, the A7 is a reliable luxury vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and factor in potential maintenance costs.
