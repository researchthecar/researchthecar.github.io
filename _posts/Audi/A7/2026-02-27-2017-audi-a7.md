### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Audi A7 generally presents a strong reliability record, particularly with its standard chassis and many of its core components. The 3.0L TFSI V6 engine is robust, though owners should be aware of potential PCV valve issues and supercharger belt wear. The 8-speed Tiptronic transmission is largely trouble-free. However, the 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission has been associated with mechatronic unit failures, which can be costly to repair. The optional adaptive air suspension, while offering superior comfort, is more prone to issues like air spring leaks and compressor failures than the standard suspension. Electrical gremlins, primarily software-related in the infotainment system, and occasional parasitic battery drain are also noted. Interior components are generally reliable, with blend door actuators being a less common but documented concern. Overall, the A7 is a reliable luxury vehicle, but potential buyers should consider the specific transmission and suspension options, as these are the most likely areas for significant repair costs.
