### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi A7 Quattro is a compelling luxury vehicle with a generally good reliability record. The primary areas that may require attention as the vehicle ages are the powertrain, particularly the 8-speed Tiptronic transmission's mechatronic unit and torque converter, and the 3.0L TFSI engine's PCV system and supercharger belt. Owners opting for the adaptive air suspension should be aware of potential leaks or compressor issues. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MMI infotainment system, can also occur. While these potential issues exist, they are not universally experienced, and many A7s provide years of dependable service with proper maintenance. Proactive checks of these known weak points can mitigate unexpected repair costs.
