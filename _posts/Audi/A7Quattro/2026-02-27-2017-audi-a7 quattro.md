### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Audi A7 Quattro generally presents a strong reliability record, particularly concerning its powertrain and core mechanicals. The 3.0L TFSI engine, while robust, can occasionally exhibit issues with the PCV system and valve cover gaskets, leading to oil consumption and leaks. The 8-speed automatic transmission is typically dependable. Owners with the optional adaptive air suspension should be aware of potential leaks in the air struts, which can be a significant repair cost. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system's software and less commonly, LED headlight modules, are noted. Interior components like climate control blend door actuators can also fail. Overall, the A7 is a well-built vehicle, but potential buyers should factor in the possibility of addressing these specific, albeit not universal, issues.
