### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Audi A7 Quattro offers a compelling blend of style and performance, with its core powertrain generally proving robust. However, potential owners should be aware of specific issues that can arise, particularly with the optional adaptive air suspension, which can be costly to repair if leaks or compressor failures occur. The 3.0L TFSI engine, while powerful, has documented concerns with its PCV system and supercharger belt. Transmission issues, though not universal, can involve expensive mechatronic unit or torque converter repairs. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MMI infotainment system and LED lighting, are also noted. While many components are reliable, the complexity of the A7 means that addressing these specific potential problems proactively can save significant expense and ensure a more positive ownership experience.
