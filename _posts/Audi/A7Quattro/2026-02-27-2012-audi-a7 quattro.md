### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi A7 Quattro offers a compelling blend of style and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 3.0L TFSI engine can experience issues with its PCV system and supercharger belt. The 8-speed automatic transmission, while generally smooth, has documented problems with its mechatronic unit and torque converter. Owners opting for the adaptive air suspension should budget for potential leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the MMI infotainment system and adaptive lighting, are also noted. Interior components like HVAC resistors and power seat actuators can also require attention. Despite these potential issues, many A7s remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs of these known weak points.
