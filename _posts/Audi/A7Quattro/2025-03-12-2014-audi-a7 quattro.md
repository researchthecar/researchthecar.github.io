The 2014 Audi A7 Quattro is a stylish and luxurious four-door coupe known for its sleek design, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. The most common engine option is the 3.0L Supercharged V6 producing 310 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. The other engine option is the 3.0L Turbo Diesel V6 producing 240 horsepower and 428 lb-ft of torque. Both engine options are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the A7's elegant interior, comfortable seats, and sporty handling, but some common dislikes include the complicated MMI system, expensive maintenance, and potential for electrical gremlins.

**Engine**

**3.0L Supercharged V6**

*   **Supercharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, loss of power, and potentially triggering the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the supercharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+

*   **Thermostat Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak near the front of the engine. Can lead to overheating if coolant levels drop too low.
    *   Solution: Replace the thermostat housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**3.0L TDI (Turbo Diesel) V6**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and DPF warning light illumination. This can be caused by a clogged DPF.
    *   Solution: DPF regeneration (either forced or through driving), DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+ depending on the repair needed.

*   **AdBlue (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, warning messages related to DEF levels or system malfunction. This can be due to DEF injector failure, DEF pump failure, or DEF tank heater failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific component failure within the AdBlue system and replacing the faulty part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the repair needed.

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, inability to shift, or transmission entering limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at low speeds, especially during acceleration. Can also cause delayed or rough shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, failure to maintain ride height, and potentially an error message on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

*   **Air Strut Leaks (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to compressor failure, the vehicle will sag, especially overnight. Hissing sound may be heard near the affected strut.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per strut

**Electrical**

*   **MMI (Multi Media Interface) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: System freezing, unresponsive buttons, screen flickering, and navigation problems. This could be due to software glitches or hardware failure.
    *   Solution: Software update, or replacing the MMI control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software) - $1,500+ (control unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight, requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Finding the parasitic drain (often caused by a faulty module or accessory) and repairing the component causing the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**

**Summary:**

The 2014 Audi A7 Quattro, while a luxurious and enjoyable vehicle, can be prone to several issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine (particularly the supercharger on the 3.0T and DPF/AdBlue on the TDI), the transmission's mechatronic unit, and the air suspension system (if equipped). Electrical issues with the MMI system are also common. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major component replacements, potentially making maintenance expensive over the long term. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential pitfalls and factor them into their purchase decision.
