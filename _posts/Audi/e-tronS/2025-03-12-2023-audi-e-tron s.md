**Electric Motor**

**Tri-Motor Configuration**

*   **Drive System Malfunction/Reduced Power**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the "Drive System Malfunction" warning appearing on the dashboard, sometimes accompanied by a significant reduction in power. This can occur intermittently or become persistent. It may be related to issues within the electric motor control system or battery management.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by an Audi dealership is required to pinpoint the source of the issue. The fix can range from software updates to component replacement within the electric motor or battery systems.

    * Solution: An Audi dealership should perform a diagnostic test to assess the health and balance of the battery cells. If imbalance is confirmed, the dealership may attempt to rebalance the cells through software or, in more severe cases, replace individual modules or the entire battery pack.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies significantly. Rebalancing may be covered under warranty. Battery module or pack replacement can cost $10,000+.
