The 2002 Audi S8 is a high-performance luxury sedan known for its sophisticated design and powerful engine. It was only available with one engine option, a 4.2-liter V8 producing 360 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People appreciate the S8 for its blend of luxury, performance, and understated elegance. However, potential downsides include higher maintenance costs and the age-related issues common with older, complex vehicles.

**Engine**

**4.2L V8**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt is crucial for synchronizing the engine's camshafts and crankshaft. If the timing belt fails (especially if maintenance is neglected), the engine can suffer catastrophic damage due to valve-piston collision. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, and eventually a complete engine stall.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing belt, water pump, tensioners, and idler pulleys is a scheduled maintenance item, typically every 75,000-90,000 miles. If the belt breaks, engine repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Timing belt replacement is usually $800 - $1500. If engine damage occurs, repair or replacement can cost $3,000 - $8,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4.2L V8 is prone to oil leaks, especially from the valve cover gaskets and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the ground, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gasket replacement can range from $300 - $600. Rear main seal replacement is more involved and typically costs $800 - $1500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, shuddering during acceleration, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, erratic gear changes, or getting stuck in a gear.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Audi S8 is equipped with an air suspension system. Common issues include a sagging suspension, especially overnight, a rough ride, or a suspension malfunction warning light. These problems are typically caused by leaks in the air struts, a failing air compressor, or faulty ride height sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air struts, air compressor, or ride height sensors. Sometimes, just replacing the o-rings on the air struts fixes the leak if the struts are still in good condition.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air strut replacement can cost $800 - $1500+ per strut. Air compressor replacement is typically $500 - $1000. Ride height sensor replacement is usually $200 - $500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Pixelated or Failing Instrument Cluster Display**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sections of the instrument cluster display (especially the central information display) lose pixels or become unreadable.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Repair can range from $300 - $600. Replacement can cost $800 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system can become unreliable, with doors not locking or unlocking properly. This can be due to faulty door lock actuators or issues with the central control module.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty door lock actuators or repair of the central control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Door lock actuator replacement can range from $200 - $500 per door. Central control module repair can vary but often costs $300 - $800.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding/Yellowing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic headlight lenses can become cloudy or yellowed over time, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Headlight lens restoration or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Lens restoration can range from $50 - $150. Headlight assembly replacement is typically $300 - $800 per headlight.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof can develop issues with opening or closing smoothly, getting stuck, or leaking. This can be due to a worn sunroof motor, damaged tracks, or clogged drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Sunroof motor replacement, track repair, or cleaning of drain tubes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Sunroof motor replacement can range from $300 - $700. Track repair can vary but often costs $200 - $500. Drain tube cleaning is typically $50 - $150.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Audi S8, while a desirable performance sedan, is prone to certain age-related issues. Engine and transmission problems, particularly timing belt failure, oil leaks, and transmission issues, can be costly. Air suspension problems and electrical glitches are also common. The severity and cost of these issues can range from moderate to significant, making it crucial to have a pre-purchase inspection and budget for potential repairs when considering a used 2002 Audi S8.
