**Engine**

**4.0L Twin-Turbocharged V8**
* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, reduced power, check engine light. Oil leaks can also be present around the turbocharger.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger(s).  It's often recommended to replace both turbos simultaneously to ensure even performance and avoid future issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (depending on replacing one or both, and independent shop vs. dealership)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Separator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, smoke from the exhaust, rough idling, and potential oil leaks. Can cause the PCV system to malfunction.
    * Solution: Replacement of the oil separator (also known as the PCV valve/oil trap).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant level dropping, overheating, sweet smell near the engine. Leaks often originate from plastic coolant pipes or the water pump.
