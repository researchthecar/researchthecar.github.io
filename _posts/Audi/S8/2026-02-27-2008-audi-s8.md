### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Audi S8 is a powerful and luxurious sedan, but its complexity, particularly the V10 engine and adaptive air suspension, can lead to significant repair costs if issues arise. Common problems include carbon buildup and timing chain wear on the engine, and leaks or compressor failures in the air suspension system. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can also be costly. Electrical gremlins, especially with the MMI system, are not uncommon. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair bills, and a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended. Despite these potential drawbacks, the S8 offers a unique blend of performance and comfort for those willing to invest in its upkeep.
