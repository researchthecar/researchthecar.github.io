*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, timing chain cover, and rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. Thorough cleaning of the engine to identify the source of the leak is important.

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the V10 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves. This restricts airflow, leading to rough idling, reduced performance, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Walnut blasting or chemical cleaning of the intake valves to remove the carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coils Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires can occur due to faulty ignition coils. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough running engine, and decreased performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils. Replacing all the coils at the same time is recommended to avoid future problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil depending on OEM vs aftermarket and shop rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slipping between gears, or a complete loss of drive can indicate a failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the torque converter. Transmission fluid flush is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, or getting stuck in a gear can be caused by problems with the valve body.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body. A software update might also resolve some valve body issues.
