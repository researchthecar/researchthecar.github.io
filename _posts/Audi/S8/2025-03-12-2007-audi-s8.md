**Engine**

**5.2L V10**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various areas, including the valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, and oil cooler lines. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, low oil level, and burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is usually the solution. For oil cooler lines, replacement with upgraded aftermarket lines may be a more permanent fix.
