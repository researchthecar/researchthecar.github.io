The 2009 Audi S8 is a high-performance luxury sedan known for its blend of comfort, technology, and exhilarating power. This model year features a 5.2L V10 engine producing 450 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a six-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. Owners often praise the S8 for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and confident handling. Some common dislikes include high maintenance costs, complex electronics that can be prone to issues, and relatively poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

**5.2L V10**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This may be due to worn valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source of the oil consumption. Repair options range from replacing valve stem seals to a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines, like the S8's V10, are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves. This can lead to rough idling, reduced performance, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: A manual cleaning of the intake valves or walnut blasting is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing coolant leaks from the coolant pipes and hoses in the engine bay, requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled maintenance.
    * Solution: A pressure test on the cooling system can help diagnose the source of the leaks, and then replace the damaged parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Tiptronic Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter, especially in higher mileage vehicles, can fail, causing shuddering during acceleration, erratic shifting, and transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body, which controls the flow of transmission fluid, can develop issues. This leads to harsh or delayed shifts, gear slippage, or the transmission getting stuck in a single gear.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body is the common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system is a common source of problems. Symptoms include the car sitting unevenly, failing to raise or lower, or displaying warning lights on the dashboard. This could be caused by leaks in the air struts, a failing air compressor, or a faulty control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves identifying the source of the leak or component failure. Replacing the affected air strut(s), compressor, or control module is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut; $500 - $1,500 for the compressor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S8's complex electronics can sometimes lead to excessive battery drain, especially if the car is not driven frequently. This can result in a dead battery and starting problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the drain is crucial. Common culprits include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **MMI (Multi Media Interface) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI system can experience glitches, frozen screens, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Sometimes a software update can resolve minor issues. More serious problems may require replacing the MMI control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adaptive headlights can experience issues with their motors or sensors. This leads to the lights not leveling properly or turning as they should.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected headlight assembly or the individual motor/sensor may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per headlight
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can fail, causing it to get stuck open, closed, or to not operate smoothly.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the sunroof motor, tracks, or related components is the likely solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Audi S8, while a desirable vehicle for its performance and luxury, is prone to certain issues, particularly with its engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. Oil consumption, carbon buildup, and air suspension problems are fairly common and potentially costly to address. Electrical gremlins can also be a nuisance. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing and maintenance budget. The overall cost of ownership can be high due to the complexity of the car and the price of replacement parts.
