### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Audi S8 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but its advanced systems, particularly the adaptive air suspension and the complex V8 engine, can present significant repair costs if issues arise. The timing chain tensioners are a critical concern that requires immediate attention if symptoms appear. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, electrical gremlins related to the BCM can be frustrating. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance costs, especially concerning the engine and suspension components, and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections.
