### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Audi S8 is a capable performance sedan, but its complexity means potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 4.2L V8 engine's timing chain tensioners and valley pan gasket are known weak points that can lead to significant repair costs if they fail. The automatic transmission, while generally robust, can suffer from torque converter or valve body issues. The adaptive air suspension, a hallmark of the S8, is prone to leaks and sensor problems. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM, and ignition coil failures are also documented. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and proactive addressing of known problems, the 2001 S8 can remain a rewarding vehicle to own.
