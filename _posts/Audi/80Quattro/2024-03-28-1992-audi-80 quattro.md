Despite its strengths, the 80 Quattro has experienced a number of issues over the years.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

* **Head gasket failure:** Premature failure of the head gasket can occur, leading to coolant leaks, overheating, and engine damage. Symptoms include excessive coolant consumption, white smoke from the exhaust, and oil in the coolant. Requires replacement of the head gasket, cylinder head, and bolts. Estimated cost: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Intake manifold gasket leak:** Failure of the intake manifold gasket can cause a vacuum leak, resulting in rough idling, poor fuel economy, and decreased performance. Requires replacement of the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost: $300 - $500+

**2.3L Inline-5**

* **Crankshaft sensor failure:** Malfunction of the crankshaft sensor can disrupt the engine's ignition timing, causing misfires, stalling, and starting problems. Requires replacement of the crankshaft sensor. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual**

* **Synchro damage:** Wear and tear on the synchronizers can lead to grinding or difficulty shifting gears. Requires rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Estimated cost: $1,000 - $2,000+

**4-speed Automatic**

* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing slippage, shuddering, and loss of power. Requires rebuilding or replacing the torque converter. Estimated cost: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Transmission control module (TCM) failure:** Malfunction of the TCM can disrupt the transmission's operation, leading to shifting problems, delayed engagement, and overheating. Requires replacement of the TCM. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+
