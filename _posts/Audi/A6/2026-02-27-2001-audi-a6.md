### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Audi A6, particularly models equipped with the 2.7T engine, can be a rewarding vehicle but requires diligent maintenance and awareness of potential issues. Common concerns revolve around oil leaks, ignition system components, and the PCV system for the turbocharged engines. The V8 models are susceptible to expensive timing chain tensioner problems. Automatic transmissions can develop leaks or valve body issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks are also wear items. Electrically, the Body Control Module and window regulators can be problematic. While not overwhelmingly unreliable, owners should budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the more complex engine options and their associated systems. Regular fluid changes and proactive checks are crucial for longevity.
