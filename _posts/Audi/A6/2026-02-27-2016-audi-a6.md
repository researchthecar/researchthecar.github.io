### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Audi A6 is a well-built luxury sedan with a generally good reliability record. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly concerning the engines (oil consumption on the 2.0T, timing chain wear) and transmissions (mechatronic units and torque converters in automatics, clutch packs in dual-clutches). The air suspension system, if equipped, can also be a source of costly repairs due to leaks. Electrical gremlins, such as MMI system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are not uncommon. Proactive maintenance, especially fluid changes for the transmission and regular oil checks for the engine, is crucial. Addressing minor issues promptly can prevent them from escalating into more significant and expensive repairs.
