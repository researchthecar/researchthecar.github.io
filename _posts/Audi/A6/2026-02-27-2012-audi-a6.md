### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi A6 is a well-built luxury sedan with a generally good reliability record. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the powertrain, specifically oil consumption and timing chain concerns on the 2.0L TFSI engine, and potential mechatronic unit or torque converter problems in the automatic transmissions. The 3.0L TFSI V6 is generally more robust but can experience supercharger belt or PCV issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the MMI system, can occur. Owners opting for the air suspension should be aware of potential leak issues. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the 2012 A6 can provide a comfortable and enjoyable driving experience.
