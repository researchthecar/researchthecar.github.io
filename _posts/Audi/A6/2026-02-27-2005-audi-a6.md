### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Audi A6 presents a compelling luxury sedan option, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. Diesel engines, particularly the TDI variants, can face issues with turbochargers, injectors, and emissions systems like the DPF and EGR valve. The Multitronic CVT transmission is known for potential failures, making the Tiptronic automatic a generally more robust choice. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MMI infotainment system and lighting modules, are also noted. While the chassis and exterior are generally solid, optional air suspension can be a costly repair. Proactive maintenance and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended for this model.
