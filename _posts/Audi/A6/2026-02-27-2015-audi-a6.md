### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi A6 generally presents a solid reliability record, especially for models equipped with the standard suspension and automatic transmissions. However, potential buyers should be aware of specific engine concerns, particularly oil consumption and timing chain issues with the 2.0L TFSI, and PCV valve problems with the 3.0L TFSI. Diesel variants may encounter DPF issues. Transmission reliability is generally good, though the S tronic dual-clutch can experience clutch wear. Optional air suspension systems can be a source of costly repairs if leaks develop. Electrical gremlins, such as MMI system glitches, are also noted. Overall, with proper maintenance and awareness of these potential issues, the 2015 A6 can be a reliable luxury vehicle.
