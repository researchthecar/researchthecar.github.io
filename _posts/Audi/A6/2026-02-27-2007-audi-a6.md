### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Audi A6 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the manual transmission variants and exterior/interior components generally hold up well, the automatic transmissions, particularly the CVT, can be a source of significant expense. Engine-wise, the V6 and V8 FSI engines are prone to costly timing chain and oil consumption issues. The 2.0T is more susceptible to turbo and PCV problems. Electrical gremlins, such as MMI glitches and CAN bus errors, are also not uncommon. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these specific components, especially as the vehicle ages. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating larger issues and maintaining the A6's luxury experience.
