The 2007 Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, stylish interior, and available Quattro all-wheel drive. Engine options included a 3.2L V6 producing 255 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.2L V8 making 350 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the A6 for its sophisticated design, smooth handling, and luxurious features. Common complaints included issues with electrical components, the Multi Media Interface (MMI) system, and higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles.
