### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Audi A6, while a luxurious and capable vehicle, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of its age and complexity. The most significant potential issues lie within the engine, particularly with timing chain tensioners on the V6 and V8 models, and turbocharger components on the 2.7T. Automatic transmissions can also develop issues with torque converters and valve bodies. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and pixelated displays, are not uncommon. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also wear items. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential costs and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections, especially focusing on the powertrain and electrical systems.
