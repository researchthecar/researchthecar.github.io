**Summary**

The 2013 Audi A6, while a well-regarded luxury sedan, can experience several common issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption and timing chain issues in the 2.0L and supercharger issues in the 3.0L, can be costly to address. Transmission problems with the 8-speed automatic, especially Mechatronic unit failure, are also significant. Electrical issues with the MMI system and battery drain can be frustrating. While some repairs are relatively minor, others, such as engine or transmission work, can be quite expensive, potentially impacting the overall ownership cost. It's crucial to get a pre-purchase inspection and understand the repair history before buying a used 2013 A6.
