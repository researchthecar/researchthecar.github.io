Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2000 Audi A6, formatted as requested.

The 2000 Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its sophisticated styling, comfortable ride, and available quattro all-wheel drive. Engine options for this year included a 2.8L V6, and a 2.7T twin-turbo V6. The 2.8L produced around 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. The 2.7T produced around 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (primarily with the 2.8L, though some 2.7T models had it), and a 5-speed automatic (available with both engines). Owners often praise the A6 for its luxurious interior, comfortable ride, and all-weather capability (with quattro). Common complaints include higher maintenance costs compared to domestic vehicles, and potential for expensive repairs as the car ages.
