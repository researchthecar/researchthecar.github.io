### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Audi A6, while offering a premium experience, presents some notable reliability concerns, particularly with its more complex engine options (3.2L V6 and 4.2L V8 FSI) due to timing chain tensioner issues and oil consumption. The automatic transmission's mechatronic unit can also be a source of expensive repairs. Electrical gremlins, such as MFI display failures and window regulators, are not uncommon. However, the manual transmission and exterior components generally fare better. Owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with these known issues, especially if purchasing a used model.
