The 2012 Audi A6 (C7 generation) is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. Engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, producing 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter supercharged V6, generating 310 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission (Tiptronic). The car is generally liked for its luxurious interior, composed handling, and available quattro all-wheel drive. Some common dislikes include potential reliability issues, the complexity of the infotainment system, and higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (TFSI)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported high oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
