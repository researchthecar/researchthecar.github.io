The 2017 Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its elegant styling, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. Engine options included a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (252 hp, 273 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 (333 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were typically paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the A6 for its quiet cabin, refined handling, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include the relatively high cost of maintenance and some reported issues with electronic systems.
