**Summary**

The 2004 Audi A6, while offering a luxurious driving experience, is known for its potential reliability issues and high maintenance costs, especially as the cars age. Engine issues such as timing belt/chain failures and oil leaks can be costly to repair. The CVT transmission, in particular, is a known weak point and has the potential for expensive repairs. Electrical problems with the instrument cluster and central locking system are also common. Suspension problems such as control arm bushing failure and air suspension issues (on equipped models) can further add to the ownership costs. While some issues may be relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite severe and lead to repair bills in the thousands of dollars. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
