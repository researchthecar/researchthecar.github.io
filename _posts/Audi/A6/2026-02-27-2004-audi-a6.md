# 2004 Audi A6

### Overview
The 2004 Audi A6, part of the C6 generation, offered a blend of luxury, performance, and advanced technology for its time. It was available with a range of sophisticated engines, including naturally aspirated and turbocharged gasoline options, as well as TDI diesel variants. The interior was known for its high-quality materials and ergonomic design, while the exterior presented a sleek and modern aesthetic. However, like many complex European vehicles of this era, certain components can be prone to specific issues as they age, particularly those related to electronics and powertrain components. Understanding these potential weak points is crucial for owners to ensure long-term reliability and manage maintenance costs effectively.

### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Audi A6 is a capable luxury sedan, but its complexity means potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The most significant issues tend to revolve around the timing chain tensioners on V6 and V8 gasoline engines, which can lead to very expensive repairs if they fail. Automatic transmissions, particularly the later 6-speed units, can also develop issues with their mechatronic units. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or MMI system, are also a common complaint. While the TDI diesel engines and manual transmissions are generally more robust, the overall reliability is heavily influenced by maintenance history and the specific powertrain chosen. Regular servicing and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for mitigating potential problems and ensuring a positive ownership experience.
