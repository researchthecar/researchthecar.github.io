### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Audi A6 is a well-built luxury vehicle with a generally positive reliability record. The most frequently reported technical concerns tend to revolve around the gasoline engines, particularly the 2.0L TFSI's potential for oil consumption and PCV valve issues, and the 3.0L TFSI's supercharger belt and PCV system. Automatic transmission issues, especially with the mechatronic unit and torque converter, can be costly but are not universally reported. Optional air suspension systems can also present expensive repairs if components like struts or compressors fail. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the MMI system and battery drain, are also noted. Despite these potential issues, many owners report a satisfying ownership experience, especially if proactive maintenance and timely repairs are performed.
