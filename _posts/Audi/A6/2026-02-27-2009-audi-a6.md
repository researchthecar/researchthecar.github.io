### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Audi A6, while a luxurious and capable vehicle, presents several potential reliability concerns, particularly with its more complex engine and transmission options. The FSI engines, especially the V6 and V8 variants, are prone to timing chain issues and oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. The 2.0L TFSI also suffers from oil consumption and potential turbo issues. Automatic transmissions, especially the CVT, can experience significant failures. Electrical gremlins, such as MMI glitches and battery drain, are also noted. Owners opting for this model should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs, especially if they choose models with the larger engines or advanced features like air suspension. Regular and diligent maintenance is crucial to mitigate some of these risks.
