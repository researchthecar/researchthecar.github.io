### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Audi A6 presents a generally reliable luxury sedan, particularly with its manual transmission. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, especially concerning the timing chain tensioners and oil consumption in the V6 and V8 FSI engines, and oil consumption and turbo issues in the 2.0L TFSI. Automatic transmissions, particularly the Tiptronic, can experience mechatronic unit or torque converter problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as MMI system glitches, can also arise. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most frequent non-routine repairs reported for this model year.
