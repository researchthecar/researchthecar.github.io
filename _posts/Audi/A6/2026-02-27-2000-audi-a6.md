### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Audi A6, particularly models with the 2.7T engine, can be a rewarding vehicle but requires diligent maintenance and awareness of potential issues. Common problems include turbocharger failures and PCV system issues on the 2.7T, timing belt related concerns on the 2.8L, and timing chain tensioner problems on the 4.2L V8. Automatic transmission valve body and torque converter issues are also noted. Electrically, BCM malfunctions and ignition coil failures can occur. While the suspension and exterior/interior components are generally robust, specific items like control arm bushings and door lock actuators may require attention. Owners should budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the more complex engine and transmission systems, to maintain reliability.
