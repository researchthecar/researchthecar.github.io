The 2018 Audi A3 Sportback e-tron is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that combines a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 150 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque with an electric motor that delivers an additional 102 horsepower. This gives the car a combined output of 204 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered through a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the e-tron for its fuel efficiency, smooth ride, and luxurious interior. Common complaints revolve around limited all-electric range, relatively small cargo space, and the complexity of the hybrid system, which can lead to potentially expensive repairs.
