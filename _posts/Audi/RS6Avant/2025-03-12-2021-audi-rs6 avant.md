The 2021 Audi RS6 Avant is a high-performance wagon that blends practicality with exhilarating power. In the North American market, it comes exclusively with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 591 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the RS6's blistering acceleration, comfortable ride (especially with the air suspension), and the cargo-carrying versatility of the wagon body style. However, some criticisms include the high price tag, potential for expensive maintenance, and complex electronics that can sometimes be finicky.

**Summary**

The 2021 Audi RS6 Avant is a thrilling performance machine, but potential buyers should be aware of a few common issues. Engine problems, particularly turbocharger failure and oil leaks, can be costly to address. Suspension issues, specifically with the air suspension, are also a concern. Electrical glitches in the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions can be frustrating. While most of the issues aren't widespread, the cost of repair can be significant due to the complexity of the car and the price of parts. Addressing these issues early on with preventative maintenance is important.
