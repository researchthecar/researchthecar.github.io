- **Cost:** $150 - $300

**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning between changes, blue smoke from exhaust.
- **Solution:** Can be due to worn piston rings or valve stem seals; requires engine inspection and potential rebuild or component replacement.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $4,000+

**Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup; potential for catastrophic engine damage if ignored.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and seals.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $2,500


### 3.2L V6 FSI (BKH, BPK)
**Timing Chain Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noises from the rear of the engine, check engine light.
- **Solution:** Replacement of timing chains, tensioners, and guides. This is a labor-intensive job.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $4,000+

**Carbon Buildup**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced engine performance, rough idle, misfires.
- **Solution:** Intake manifold cleaning and walnut blasting of intake valves.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Transmission

### 6-Speed Manual (0A3)
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Audi A4 presents a mixed reliability profile. The turbocharged 2.0L FSI engine is prone to oil consumption and PCV issues, while the 3.2L V6 can suffer from timing chain and carbon buildup problems. Automatic transmissions, particularly the CVT, have a higher incidence of failure. Suspension components like control arm bushings and wheel bearings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins such as window regulators and ignition coils can also surface. Despite these potential issues, the manual transmission and the general build quality of the interior and exterior are generally robust. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble are crucial for owners of the 2005 A4.
