Alright, here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Audi A4, formatted for your website.

The 2022 Audi A4 is a popular luxury sedan known for its sleek design, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder available in two different tunings: a 40 TFSI producing 201 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, and a 45 TFSI producing 261 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission and feature quattro all-wheel drive. Owners often praise the A4's refined interior, responsive handling, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common criticisms include relatively tight rear seating and some concerns about the long-term reliability of certain electronic components.

**Summary**

The 2022 Audi A4 generally exhibits good reliability, but potential buyers should be aware of a few common issues. The most prominent concern seems to be excessive oil consumption for the 45 TFSI engine, which could lead to more significant engine repairs down the line. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions can also be frustrating. While the 7-speed S tronic transmission is generally reliable, some owners have reported rough shifting issues. While individual repair costs may vary, addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for software updates or sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission work. Overall, a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended to identify any potential problems early on.
