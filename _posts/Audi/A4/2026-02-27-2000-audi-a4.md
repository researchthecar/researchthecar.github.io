### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Audi A4 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury for its time. While generally well-built, potential owners should be aware of common issues, particularly concerning the PCV system and ignition coils on the 1.8T engines, and timing belt maintenance for all engines. Automatic transmission torque converters and manual clutch wear are also points to consider. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear over time. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and window regulators, are not uncommon. Regular maintenance, especially timely timing belt replacements, and addressing these known issues proactively will significantly contribute to the long-term reliability and enjoyment of this German sedan.
