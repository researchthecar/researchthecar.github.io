The 2000 Audi A4 (B5.5 generation) is a compact executive car known for its refined driving experience, well-appointed interior (for its time), and available Quattro all-wheel drive. It's a popular choice for those seeking a sporty and luxurious feel in a smaller package. However, as with any older vehicle, certain issues are more common than others. Owners often praise the A4's handling and the quality of its interior materials, but common complaints include the cost of repairs and the potential for various mechanical problems. The 2000 A4 was offered with a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 150 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.8L V6 engine producing 190 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2000 Audi A4, while a desirable car for its driving dynamics and interior, is prone to a variety of issues typical of a vehicle of its age. The engine and transmission can be particularly problematic, especially regarding timing belt failures and automatic transmission issues. Suspension components, such as control arm bushings, are also known to wear out. Electrical problems, especially those affecting the instrument cluster and window regulators, are also common. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive to quite significant, depending on the specific issue. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, potentially seeking a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
