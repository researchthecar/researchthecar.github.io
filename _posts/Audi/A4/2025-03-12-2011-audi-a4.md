**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (CAEB/CDNC)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Can lead to low oil pressure warnings and potential engine damage if not monitored and addressed.
    *   Solution: Audi released a technical service bulletin (TSB) and extended the warranty for oil consumption issues on certain 2.0T engines. The repair typically involves replacing the piston rings and potentially pistons. An updated PCV valve and software flash may also be part of the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and if performed at a dealer or independent shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon start-up, especially when cold. Can lead to timing chain skipping, resulting in severe engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner with the updated version to prevent future failure. Consider replacing the timing chain, guides, and sprockets as a preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and if performed at a dealer or independent shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Extended cranking, rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Tiptronic)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, transmission slipping, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replace or repair the mechatronic unit.  Flushing the transmission and replacing the filter is generally advised as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Multitronic)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky acceleration, slipping, inability to maintain consistent speed, shuddering, warning lights.  Often occurs at higher mileage.
    *   Solution: CVT transmissions are generally not repairable. Replacement is the usual solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps.  Vague steering, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn control arm bushings.  Consider replacing the entire control arm assembly as it may be more cost-effective in the long run.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per side (depending on whether bushings or entire control arms are replaced and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils. Replacing all coils at the same time is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on how many coils are replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Audi A4, while a desirable car, can suffer from several potential issues, particularly with the 2.0T engine and the Multitronic CVT transmission. The most significant concerns revolve around excessive oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failure in the 2.0T, which can lead to costly repairs. CVT transmission failure is another major expense. Other issues, such as control arm bushing wear and electrical problems, are more common and have moderate repair costs. Carefully inspect a 2011 A4 before purchase, obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic, and be aware of the potential for higher-than-average maintenance costs.
