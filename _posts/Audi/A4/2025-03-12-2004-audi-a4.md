The 2004 Audi A4 (B6 generation) is a compact executive car known for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. Common engine options include the 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 (170 hp, 166 lb-ft of torque) and the 3.0L V6 (220 hp, 221 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual (quattro models), and a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the A4 for its sporty handling and luxurious feel, but reliability and repair costs are frequently cited as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**1.8L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Oil Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the small oil capacity and poor crankcase ventilation design, this engine is prone to oil sludge buildup, especially if oil changes are neglected. This can lead to oil starvation, turbocharger failure, and ultimately engine damage. Symptoms include oil pressure warning lights, rough idling, and engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil, engine flush treatments, and in severe cases, engine disassembly and cleaning or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the severity and chosen solution)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ignition coil packs are known to fail, causing misfires, rough running, and a loss of power. Symptoms often include the check engine light illuminating with misfire codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the number of coils replaced and if you are doing it yourself)
     * Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt is crucial for synchronizing the engine's valves and pistons. If it fails, it can cause catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a sudden loss of power and/or a loud knocking sound.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing belt at recommended intervals (typically every 75,000 - 100,000 miles), along with the water pump and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioners can wear out and fail, leading to timing chain slack. This can cause rough running, misfires, and eventually engine damage. Symptoms can include a rattling noise at startup.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioners, guides, and possibly the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.0L V6 is known for coolant leaks, especially from the coolant flange and plastic coolant pipes. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking coolant components with updated parts (metal if available).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the location and number of leaks)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission (FWD)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Valve body wear can cause harsh shifting, delayed engagement, and slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission (Quattro)**

No Issues Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission (FWD)**
No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front control arm bushings are prone to wear and tear, leading to clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the parts replaced and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system can experience issues, causing doors to not lock or unlock properly, or the alarm to malfunction.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the fault (often a door lock actuator or wiring issue) and replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Instrument Cluster Pixel Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The digital displays in the instrument cluster can suffer from pixel loss, making it difficult to read important information.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Lock Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door lock modules can fail, resulting in difficulty opening or closing doors, or the inability to lock/unlock the doors with the key fob.

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof can become misaligned or jammed, causing it to not open or close properly. The motor can also fail.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the sunroof mechanism, cleaning and lubricating the tracks, or replacing the sunroof motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Audi A4 offers a blend of luxury and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly with the 1.8T engine. Oil sludge and timing belt concerns can lead to significant repair costs. While some electrical and suspension issues are relatively minor, others, like timing chain problems on the 3.0L, can be expensive to address. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended. The average cost of repairs can range from minor fixes under $200 to major engine or transmission repairs exceeding $1000.
