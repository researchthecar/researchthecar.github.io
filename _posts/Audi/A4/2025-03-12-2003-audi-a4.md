*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil sludge can accumulate in the engine, especially if oil changes are not performed regularly with the correct synthetic oil. This can lead to oil starvation, clogged oil passages, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include low oil pressure, oil consumption, and engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil (meeting VW 502.00 specification) are crucial. In severe cases, an engine flush or even engine disassembly and cleaning might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (flush) - $2000+ (engine repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ignition coil packs are prone to failure, causing misfires and rough running. The check engine light will illuminate, and diagnostic codes will indicate which cylinder is misfiring.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s). It's often recommended to replace all four at once for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 per coil pack (parts), $50 - $150 (labor if not DIY)
