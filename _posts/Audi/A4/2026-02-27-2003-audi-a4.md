### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Audi A4 presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core driving experience remains appealing, potential buyers and owners should be aware of common issues, particularly concerning the engine and transmission. The 1.8T engine is prone to ignition coil and PCV issues, while the 2.0 FSI can suffer from oil consumption and timing chain problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the 5-speed, can develop torque converter or valve body issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings and wheel bearings are also areas to monitor. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and HVAC resistors, are not uncommon. Despite these potential drawbacks, many issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs. Adhering to the recommended service schedule, especially for timing belt replacements on V6 models, is crucial for long-term reliability.
