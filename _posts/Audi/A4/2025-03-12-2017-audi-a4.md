**Summary**

The 2017 Audi A4, while generally reliable and well-regarded, does have some common issues that owners should be aware of. The most prominent of these are related to excessive oil consumption in both engine variants and potential electrical glitches with the MMI system and various sensors. Transmission problems can occur in the S tronic dual-clutch transmission, but are less common.  While most of these issues are repairable, some, like the oil consumption, can be costly to address.  Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
