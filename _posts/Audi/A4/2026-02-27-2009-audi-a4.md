### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Audi A4 is a competent luxury sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with its gasoline engines and automatic transmissions. The 2.0L TFSI engine is prone to oil consumption and PCV valve issues, while the 3.2L FSI can suffer from timing chain problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the CVT, may require costly repairs related to the mechatronic unit or the transmission itself. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear prematurely. Electrical issues are less common but can involve infotainment system glitches. Despite these potential drawbacks, many A4s remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs of known issues. Thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
