The 2008 Audi A4 (B7 generation) is a compact executive car known for its refined driving experience, stylish design, and well-appointed interior. Engine options included a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (200 hp, 207 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.2L V6 (255 hp, 243 lb-ft of torque). Transmission choices were a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed Tiptronic automatic (for both engines), and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) available only with the 2.0T FrontTrak. Owners generally appreciate the A4's handling, build quality, and comfortable interior, but common complaints include higher maintenance costs, electrical issues, and potential oil consumption problems.
