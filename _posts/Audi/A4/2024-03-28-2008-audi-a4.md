**Introduction:**
The 2008 Audi A4 is a compact luxury sedan available with various engine and transmission options. It offers a refined driving experience, spacious and well-crafted interiors, but some owners have reported issues with certain components.

**Engine**
* **2.0L TFSI Turbocharged Inline-4**

Symptoms include reduced oil levels, increased exhaust emissions, and poor engine performance. Repair involves replacing the piston rings and other affected components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,500 - $4,000+
    * **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail prematurely, causing the timing chain to jump or break. This can lead to catastrophic engine damage. The solution is to replace the tensioner and affected components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $2,500+
* **3.2L V6**
    * **Intake Manifold Flap Failure:** The intake manifold flaps can fail, causing the engine to run rough or misfire. The intake manifold needs to be replaced to fix the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000 - $2,000+
    * **Coolant Leaks:** A faulty water pump or radiator can result in coolant leaks. Symptoms include overheating and coolant loss. The leaking components must be replaced. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,200+

**Transmission**
* **Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**
    * **Belt and Pulley Issues:** The CVT's belt and pulleys can wear or break prematurely, causing transmission slippage or failure. The transmission needs to be overhauled or replaced. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,000 - $4,000+
