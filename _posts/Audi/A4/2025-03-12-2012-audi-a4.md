The 2012 Audi A4 is a popular luxury sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and engaging driving experience. The base engine is a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate the A4's fuel efficiency and refined interior, while others find the infotainment system dated and the repair costs potentially high.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.0T engine in some 2012 A4s is prone to excessive oil consumption. This can manifest as needing to add oil frequently between scheduled oil changes, low oil warning lights, and potential engine damage if not addressed. This issue is generally worse on earlier revisions of the engine and can improve from 2013 onward.
    *   Solution: A revised piston ring design is the most common fix. In severe cases, the engine may need to be rebuilt or replaced. An oil consumption test at an Audi dealership will help to determine the extent of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $7,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and repair needed.)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A faulty timing chain tensioner can cause the timing chain to skip, leading to severe engine damage. Symptoms include rattling noises upon startup, especially when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and potentially other related components if damage has occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct-injection engines like the 2.0T are susceptible to carbon buildup on the intake valves, as there is no fuel washing over the valves to clean them. This buildup restricts airflow and can cause rough idling, misfires, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: A carbon cleaning service, either by walnut blasting or chemical cleaning, to remove the carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Multitronic CVT (Front-Wheel Drive)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Multitronic CVT transmission is known for potential issues. Symptoms include jerky acceleration, slipping, hesitation, unusual noises, and failure to engage gears.
    *   Solution: In many cases, CVT failure necessitates a complete transmission replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (Quattro All-Wheel Drive)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises from the suspension, vibrations, and imprecise handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings. Sometimes it is cheaper to replace the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate properly, sticking, or making grinding noises can indicate a faulty window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlights and dry them out. reseal the headlight housing to prevent moisture from getting in. Replace the headlight if the condensation is severe or causing damage to the bulbs or electrical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 DIY, $100 - $300 professional.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system can experience glitches, freezing, and display problems. Navigation system errors and outdated maps are also common complaints.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. More severe problems may require replacement of the MMI control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the issue and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Audi A4, while a desirable vehicle, has some notable issues. The 2.0T engine's oil consumption and timing chain tensioner problems are the most concerning due to their potential for costly repairs. The Multitronic CVT transmission should be carefully inspected due to its known reliability issues. Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are also common. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the possibility of relatively expensive repairs, especially on higher-mileage examples.
