### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Audi A4 presents a generally reliable profile, particularly with its manual transmission and V6 engine options. The 2.0L TFSI engine, while powerful, is the most common source of reported issues, with PCV valve failures, oil consumption, and timing chain concerns being notable. The Multitronic CVT transmission has also shown a propensity for failure. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and headlight ballast issues, are also present. However, suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely robust. Owners should be particularly mindful of the 2.0T engine's potential oil consumption and timing chain wear, and consider the CVT transmission's reliability record when purchasing.
