### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Audi A4 (B6) presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanical components like the chassis and manual transmissions are generally robust, specific engine variants, particularly the turbocharged 1.8T and the 2.0T, are known for issues like PCV system failures and oil consumption. The V6 engines, especially the 3.0L, can face costly timing chain and tensioner problems. Automatic transmissions may require attention to the torque converter. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and ABS sensors, are also noted. Interior components like instrument cluster displays can degrade over time. Regular and diligent maintenance, especially concerning timing belt/chain services and oil changes, is crucial for mitigating many potential issues and ensuring longevity.
