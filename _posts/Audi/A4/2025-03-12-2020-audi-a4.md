Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2020 Audi A4, categorized by component and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2020 Audi A4 is a popular compact luxury sedan known for its sleek design, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. It offers a refined driving experience and a well-appointed interior. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of potential problems. The A4 is available with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine in two different states of tune: a 40 TFSI (188 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque) and a 45 TFSI (248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the A4's fuel efficiency, quiet cabin, and responsive handling. Some common dislikes include the sometimes-complicated infotainment system and the higher cost of maintenance compared to non-luxury vehicles.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder (45 TFSI)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 2.0L turbocharged engines consume an abnormally high amount of oil. This can manifest as needing to add oil frequently between scheduled oil changes, low oil level warnings, and in severe cases, potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: The first step is usually to monitor oil consumption by documenting how much oil is added and at what mileage intervals. A dealer might perform an oil consumption test to verify the issue. If consumption is excessive, the potential fixes range from replacing the PCV valve to address crankcase pressure issues, to piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (PCV valve) - $3000+ (piston rings)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Hesitation or Jerking During Low-Speed Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation, jerking, or rough shifts, particularly during low-speed maneuvers and initial acceleration from a stop.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a more significant problem within the transmission, such as a faulty mechatronic unit, can be the cause. Replacement of the mechatronic unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update) - $2000+ (Mechatronic Unit)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing or Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer is usually the first step. If the problem persists, hardware issues with the MMI unit itself may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update) - $1000+ (MMI Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occasional issues with the parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, or lane departure warning systems have been reported. These may result in false alerts or system failures.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the affected sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (per sensor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattle or Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the sunroof area while driving, especially on uneven roads.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the sunroof seals and tracks might temporarily alleviate the noise. In more severe cases, the sunroof frame or components may require adjustment or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (Lubrication) - $500+ (Sunroof Repair/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **LED Headlight or Taillight Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature failure of LED elements within the headlights or taillights. This can manifest as dimmed lights or complete failure of certain LED segments.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire headlight or taillight assembly is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (per headlight/taillight assembly)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Audi A4 is a well-regarded vehicle, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. The most concerning issues seem to be related to excessive oil consumption and transmission behavior. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system are also fairly common. While the issues are not overwhelmingly prevalent, they can lead to significant repair costs, especially if major components like the transmission or engine require extensive work. Proactive maintenance and addressing any warning signs promptly can help mitigate these risks.
