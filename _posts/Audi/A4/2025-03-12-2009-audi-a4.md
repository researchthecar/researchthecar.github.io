The 2009 Audi A4 (B8 generation) is a popular luxury sedan known for its stylish design, refined interior, and engaging driving experience. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 and a 3.2L V6. The 2.0L turbo produces 211 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices are a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic (Tiptronic), and a CVT (Multitronic) available only with front-wheel drive. Owners often praise the A4's attractive styling, comfortable seats, and fuel efficiency (particularly with the 2.0T). Common complaints include reported reliability issues and higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury brands.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **High Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs, often exceeding 1 quart per 1,000 miles. Can lead to low oil pressure and potential engine damage. Often accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Updated piston rings and potentially piston replacement. Some owners report success with frequent oil changes using high-quality synthetic oil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon start-up, particularly when cold. Can lead to catastrophic engine failure if the timing chain jumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner, timing chain, and associated guides. Updated tensioner designs are available to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost, reduced power, and potential for engine misfires. Check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the diverter valve with an updated diaphragm-style or piston-style valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, oil leaks, and potential for increased oil consumption. Check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the PCV valve assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.0T, the 3.2L V6 can experience timing chain stretch and tensioner failure. Rattling noises, especially on startup, are a key symptom.
    *   Solution: Timing chain, tensioner, and guide replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Multitronic)**

*   **Juddering/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation upon acceleration, particularly from a stop. Juddering or shaking during low-speed driving.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transmission fluid and adaptation reset. In severe cases, transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 for fluid change/adaptation. $4,000 - $8,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Tiptronic)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts between gears. Slipping during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and fill. Valve body replacement or repair in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid service. $1,000 - $3,000+ for valve body work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Poor handling and wandering steering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings or entire control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, and check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Audi A4, while desirable for its aesthetics and driving dynamics, is prone to some potentially expensive issues. High oil consumption and timing chain problems in both the 2.0T and 3.2L engines are significant concerns. CVT transmission issues can also lead to costly repairs. Suspension and electrical problems are also common. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential pitfalls and factor in higher-than-average maintenance costs when considering this vehicle. A thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
