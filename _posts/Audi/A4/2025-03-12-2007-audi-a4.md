The 2007 Audi A4 (B7 generation) is a compact executive car known for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience. While it offered a blend of luxury and performance, certain common issues have surfaced over time. Engine options included the 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (200 hp and 207 lb-ft of torque) and the 3.2L V6 (255 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic (Tiptronic), and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) which was available only on front-wheel-drive models. Owners often praise the A4 for its refined interior, precise handling, and overall build quality. However, some common criticisms include maintenance costs, electrical gremlins, and potential issues with certain engine and transmission configurations.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Cam Follower Failure (High Pressure Fuel Pump)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cam follower, which sits between the camshaft and the high-pressure fuel pump, can wear down, eventually leading to engine misfires, rough idling, and a loss of power. If left unaddressed, it can damage the camshaft itself. A ticking noise can also be heard.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam follower with an updated version. Consider replacing the fuel pump and camshaft if they are damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ depending on the extent of damage and which parts are replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The diverter valve, which recirculates excess boost pressure, is prone to cracking and leaking. This results in a loss of power, reduced fuel economy, and potential engine hesitation.
    *   Solution: Replace the diverter valve with an updated design or a stronger aftermarket alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.0T engine, especially in earlier model years, is known for excessive oil consumption. This is often due to piston ring design flaws. Owners may notice the need to add oil frequently between oil changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the piston rings need to be replaced, which is a major repair. Regular monitoring of oil levels and using high-quality oil is essential.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioners can wear and fail, leading to timing chain rattle, engine misfires, and potentially catastrophic engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, which can restrict airflow, leading to reduced power, rough idling, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Perform a carbon cleaning service, such as walnut blasting, to remove the carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Tiptronic)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body can experience wear and tear, leading to harsh shifting, delayed engagement, and slipping.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: CVT transmissions are known to have issues, especially with the belt slipping, shuddering during acceleration, or total failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the CVT transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The control arm bushings, especially on the front suspension, are prone to wear and tear, leading to clunking noises, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Convenience Control Module Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central convenience control module can fail, leading to issues with power windows, door locks, interior lighting, and the alarm system.
    *   Solution: Replace the central convenience control module and reprogram it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensors can fail, leading to poor fuel economy, engine misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
