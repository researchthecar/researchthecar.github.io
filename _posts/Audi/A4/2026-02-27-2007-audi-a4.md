### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Audi A4 presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline 2.0L TFSI engine is prone to issues like PCV valve failure, oil consumption, and timing chain tensioner wear, which can be costly to repair. The 3.2L V6 also faces timing chain concerns. Diesel variants have reported turbocharger and injector problems. Automatic transmissions, particularly the CVT, can be a significant source of expense with potential for failure. Manual transmissions are generally more robust, though clutch wear is a common maintenance item. Suspension components like control arm bushings and wheel bearings are typical wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and HVAC resistors, are also noted. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be aware of the significant engine and transmission-related costs that can arise.
