The 2015 Audi A4 is a popular compact executive sedan known for its refined driving experience, comfortable interior, and stylish design. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (TFSI) producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L supercharged V6 engine producing 272 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0T came standard with a 6-speed manual transmission and offered an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0T was paired exclusively with the 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the A4 for its fuel efficiency, handling, and upscale features. Common complaints include the cost of maintenance, potential for oil consumption in some models, and the complexity of the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (TFSI)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2.0T engines experience excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored closely. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating frequently, visible exhaust smoke, and the need to add oil more often than the manufacturer's recommended interval.
    *   Solution: A redesigned piston and piston ring set were released to address this issue in later models. A compression and leakdown test can confirm the problem. Repair options range from replacing piston rings to replacing the entire engine, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner on some earlier 2.0T engines can fail, leading to a stretched or skipping timing chain. This can cause rough running, misfires, and potential engine damage if the chain breaks. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to timing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and any associated damaged parts. An updated tensioner design is available to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Supercharged V6**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit, which controls the transmission's shifting functions, can fail. This can cause harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or a complete loss of gear engagement.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Mechatronic unit, which typically involves programming the new unit to the vehicle. Fluid flush and filter replacement are also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front lower control arm bushings can wear out prematurely, leading to a clunking noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can also affect handling and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation/infotainment screen can experience various issues, including freezing, blacking out, or becoming unresponsive. This can affect access to navigation, audio, and vehicle settings.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. If the problem persists, the screen or entire infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Trunk Latch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electrical latch for opening the trunk can fail. This can cause the trunk to not open or not latch when closed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the latch assembly
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof operation can become erratic or completely cease. Common causes include a faulty sunroof motor, broken tracks, or issues with the sunroof control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the specific cause. Repair may involve replacing the motor, tracks, or control module. Sunroof drain cleaning and lubrication is critical maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Warning Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light may illuminate due to a faulty seat occupancy sensor, clock spring, or other airbag system component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the specific fault code. Repair involves replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Audi A4 can be a great vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The 2.0T engine's oil consumption and timing chain tensioner problems can be costly to repair, while the 8-speed automatic transmission's Mechatronic unit failure is another significant concern. Suspension issues, electrical glitches, and sunroof problems can also add to the ownership costs. While some issues may be relatively minor, others can be quite expensive, making a thorough inspection and pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic essential.
