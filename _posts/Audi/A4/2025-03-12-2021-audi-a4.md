Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2021 Audi A4, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options.

The 2021 Audi A4 is a popular luxury sedan known for its stylish design, refined interior, and engaging driving dynamics. It's available with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine in two different power outputs: 201 horsepower/236 lb-ft of torque (40 TFSI) and 261 horsepower/273 lb-ft of torque (45 TFSI). Both engines are paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the A4's comfortable ride, advanced technology features, and fuel efficiency. However, some common criticisms include the relatively small rear seat, occasional infotainment glitches, and the cost of maintenance and repairs.
