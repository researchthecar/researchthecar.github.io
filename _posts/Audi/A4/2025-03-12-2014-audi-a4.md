The 2014 Audi A4 is a compact executive sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and sporty handling. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a supercharged 3.0L V6 producing 272 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque (available in the S4 model). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual, an 8-speed automatic (Tiptronic), and a continuously variable transmission (CVT), depending on the engine and trim level. People often praise the A4 for its luxurious interior, fuel efficiency (with the 2.0T engine), and overall driving experience. Common complaints include higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury brands and some reported issues with reliability, especially in earlier model years of this generation.

The 2.0T engine's oil consumption and timing chain concerns are significant, as is the CVT transmission's tendency to judder. The sunroof and control arm bushings are also common problem areas. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, particularly engine and transmission work, can be costly. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
