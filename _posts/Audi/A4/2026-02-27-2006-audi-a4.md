### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Audi A4 presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.0L turbo engine is prone to oil consumption and PCV issues, while the 3.2L V6 can suffer from expensive timing chain tensioner problems. Automatic transmissions may experience torque converter or valve body issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings and wheel bearings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and HVAC resistors, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, potential buyers should be aware of these specific powertrain and electrical concerns, as repairs can be costly. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for managing the long-term reliability of this model.
