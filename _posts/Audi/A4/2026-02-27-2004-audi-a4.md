### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Audi A4 offers a compelling driving experience but is not without its potential reliability concerns. Engines, particularly the turbocharged variants, can be prone to oil consumption and PCV system issues, while the V6 may face timing chain tensioner problems. Automatic transmissions can develop issues with the torque converter or valve body. Suspension components like control arm bushings and ball joints are common wear items. Electrically, window regulators and HVAC resistors are known to fail. Interior electronic displays can suffer from pixel degradation. Despite these potential issues, many A4s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and timely repairs, especially those with the simpler 2.5L I5 engine and manual transmissions.
