Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2018 Audi A4, categorized by system and specific to engine/transmission options where applicable.

The 2018 Audi A4 is a popular luxury sedan known for its stylish design, refined interior, and engaging driving experience. It was offered with two main engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (TFSI) in two states of tune and the S4 which has the 3.0-liter turbocharged V6. The base 2.0T produced 190 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, while the higher-output version made 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. All A4s came standard with front-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive (Quattro) available. The 2.0T engine could be paired with either a 7-speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission, or a 6-speed manual transmission (limited availability). Owners often praise the A4 for its fuel efficiency, technology features, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include electrical glitches, oil consumption (specifically the higher-output 2.0T), and the responsiveness of the infotainment system.
