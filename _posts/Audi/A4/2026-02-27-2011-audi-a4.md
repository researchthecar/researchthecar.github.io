### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Audi A4 presents a generally reliable package, particularly for models equipped with the 3.2L V6 engine and automatic transmissions, which show fewer documented common issues. The 2.0L TFSI engine, while offering good performance, is more prone to specific problems like PCV valve failure, oil consumption, and timing chain wear, which can be costly to repair.

Addressing these potential issues proactively, especially on higher-mileage examples, can contribute to a more dependable ownership experience. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial.
