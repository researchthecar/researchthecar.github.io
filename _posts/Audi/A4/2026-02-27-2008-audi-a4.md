### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Audi A4 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the 2.0L TFSI engine's oil consumption and timing chain tensioners, and the Multitronic CVT transmission's valve body. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MMI system, can also arise. While suspension and interior components are generally robust, specific failures like control arm bushings and climate control actuators can occur. Addressing these known issues proactively through thorough pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance can significantly improve the ownership experience and mitigate unexpected repair costs.
