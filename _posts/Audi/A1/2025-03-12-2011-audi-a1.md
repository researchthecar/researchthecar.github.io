Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2011 Audi A1, categorized by major components. The 2011 Audi A1 is a stylish and compact premium hatchback, offering a blend of sporty handling and upscale features. Engine options vary depending on the market, but commonly included are the 1.2 TFSI, 1.4 TFSI, and 1.6 TDI.
