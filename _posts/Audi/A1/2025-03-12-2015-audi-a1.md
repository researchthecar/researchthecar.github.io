The 2015 Audi A1 is a subcompact car known for its stylish design, premium interior, and agile handling. It was available with several engine options including the 1.0L TFSI three-cylinder, the 1.4L TFSI four-cylinder, and the 1.6L TDI diesel. Transmissions included a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, and a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic. The 1.4L TFSI engine, a common choice, produced around 125 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the A1's fuel efficiency and upscale feel, but some criticize its limited rear seat space and relatively firm ride. Common complaints also include some issues with the S tronic transmission and occasional electrical glitches.
