The 2024 Audi RS7 Sportback is a high-performance luxury sedan that blends stunning design with exhilarating performance. It boasts a potent 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, producing a staggering 591 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed through an eight-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission with quattro all-wheel drive. Many owners praise the RS7's blistering acceleration, comfortable interior, and striking exterior. However, some criticisms include its high price tag, complex technology that can be overwhelming, and potential for expensive maintenance and repairs.
