The 2016 Audi allroad is a compact luxury wagon known for its blend of practicality, comfort, and understated style. It comes equipped with a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the allroad's comfortable ride, spacious cargo area, and standard all-wheel drive. Common dislikes often revolve around infotainment system complexity, potential for costly repairs, and fuel economy that doesn't always match expectations.

**Summary**

The 2016 Audi allroad, while a generally reliable and well-regarded vehicle, is subject to some common issues. The most concerning are related to the engine (excessive oil consumption, timing chain tensioner) and transmission (rough shifting), which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system, can also be frustrating. Suspension and sunroof problems are less common but can still occur. The overall severity of potential issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect any used allroad before purchase, including having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
