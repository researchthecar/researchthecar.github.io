The 2015 Audi allroad is a compact luxury wagon known for its blend of practicality, comfort, and all-weather capability. It offers a unique alternative to SUVs and sedans, boasting increased ground clearance and standard quattro all-wheel drive. The 2015 allroad comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine, producing 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the allroad for its refined interior, comfortable ride, and versatile cargo space. Common dislikes include higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles and occasional reports of electronic glitches.

Addressing these major issues can range from several hundred to several thousand dollars. While the allroad offers a desirable driving experience, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for these more expensive repairs.
