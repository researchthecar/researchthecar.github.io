### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Audi allroad is a capable and comfortable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 2.0L TFSI engine can be prone to issues like PCV valve failure, water pump leaks, and timing chain wear, which can be costly to repair. If equipped with the adaptive air suspension, be prepared for potential leaks or sensor malfunctions. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and tail lights, are also noted. Opting for a model with the standard steel spring suspension may offer greater long-term reliability. Thorough pre-purchase inspection, especially of the engine and suspension, is highly recommended.
