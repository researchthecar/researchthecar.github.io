    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil consumption increasing, visible oil leaks around the turbochargers, blue smoke from the exhaust, and possible reduction in engine performance.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger oil lines and seals for leaks. Replace the damaged oil lines or turbochargers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on severity and which turbocharger needs replacing.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve covers, burning oil smell, and potential for oil to drip onto hot exhaust components.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Turbocharged V6 Plug-in Hybrid (60 TFSI e)**

*   **Hybrid System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Error messages related to the hybrid system, reduced electric range, failure to switch between electric and gasoline modes smoothly.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the hybrid system using Audi diagnostic tools. This could involve replacing faulty sensors, control modules, or even the high-voltage battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $10,000+ depending on the issue and parts that need replacing
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Tiptronic Automatic Transmission (All Engine Options)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change and software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the valve body may need repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into drive or reverse and the vehicle actually moving.
    *   Solution: Similar to rough shifting, start with a fluid check and potential software update. Internal transmission damage may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $7,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, air compressor running constantly, "Suspension Fault" warning message. Common culprits include leaks in the air struts, a failing air compressor, or a faulty height sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the air leak or compressor failure. Replace the leaking air strut(s), air compressor, or height sensor(s) as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ per strut/compressor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezes/Glitches**
