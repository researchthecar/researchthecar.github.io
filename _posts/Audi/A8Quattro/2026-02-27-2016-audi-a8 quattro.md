### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Audi A8 Quattro is a sophisticated luxury sedan that, while generally reliable, has specific areas that may require attention. The V6 and V8 engines, particularly the TFSI variants, can experience issues like PCV valve failures, oil leaks, and turbocharger problems, with repair costs varying significantly. The advanced ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, while robust, can suffer from mechatronic unit or torque converter failures. The adaptive air suspension is a notable area for potential expense, with leaks in air springs or compressor failures being common. Electrical systems, especially the MMI infotainment and LED headlights, can also present intermittent glitches or malfunctions. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs associated with these complex systems, but with proper care and addressing issues promptly, the A8 can remain a comfortable and capable luxury vehicle.
