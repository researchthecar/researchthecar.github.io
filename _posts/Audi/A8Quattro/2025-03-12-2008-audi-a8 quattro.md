**Summary**

The 2008 Audi A8 Quattro offers a luxurious driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues that can arise with age. The most prevalent concerns revolve around the air suspension system, electrical problems, and potential engine issues such as timing chain tensioner failure. These issues can be costly to repair, making a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic essential. While the 3.2L V6 engine option exists, it doesn't seem to have as many issues as the 4.2L V8. The issues range from moderate inconvenience (electrical gremlins) to significant repair costs (engine or transmission problems). Potential buyers should budget accordingly for potential maintenance and repairs.
