### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi A8 Quattro is a well-built luxury sedan with a generally strong reliability record. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to its advanced systems, such as the adaptive air suspension and the complex infotainment (MMI) system. Engine-specific concerns, particularly with the supercharged V6 and twin-turbo V8, often involve components like PCV valves, belts, and seals, which are not uncommon for high-performance engines. Transmission issues, while not pervasive, can be costly if the mechatronic unit or torque converter requires attention. Electrical gremlins, especially with the MMI and door actuators, can also arise. Despite these potential points of failure, the A8 offers a premium and largely dependable ownership experience when properly maintained.
