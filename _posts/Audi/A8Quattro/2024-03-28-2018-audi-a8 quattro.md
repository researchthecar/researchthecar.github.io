**Introduction**

The 2018 Audi A8 Quattro is a full-size luxury sedan that offers a refined driving experience with advanced technology and amenities. It is available with a choice of two engine options: a 3.0L turbocharged V6 or a 4.0L twin-turbocharged V8. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The A8 Quattro is well-received for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and top-notch technology. However, it has also faced some issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbocharged V6**
