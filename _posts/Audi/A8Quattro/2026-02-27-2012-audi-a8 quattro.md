### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi A8 Quattro is a sophisticated luxury sedan that, for the most part, offers good reliability. The powertrain options, particularly the 3.0L TFSI V6, have some documented issues like PCV valve failures and supercharger belt wear, which are moderately costly to repair. The advanced adaptive air suspension is a common source of concern, with potential for leaks and compressor failures, representing a significant repair expense. Electrical gremlins within the MMI system and occasional door lock actuator failures are also noted. While not immune to problems, especially given its complexity, the A8 Quattro's overall reliability is considered acceptable for its class, provided potential issues are addressed promptly.
