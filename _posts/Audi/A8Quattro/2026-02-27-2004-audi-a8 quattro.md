### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Audi A8 Quattro is a capable luxury vehicle, but its advanced systems, particularly the air suspension and V8 engines, are known to require significant maintenance and can be costly to repair. The timing chain tensioners on the V8 engines are a notable weak point that can lead to severe damage if not addressed proactively. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MMI system and door actuators, are also common as the vehicle ages. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, owners should be prepared for potential expenses related to the powertrain and suspension, which are critical to the A8's driving experience.
