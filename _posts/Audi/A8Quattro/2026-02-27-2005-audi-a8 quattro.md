### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Audi A8 Quattro is a luxurious and capable vehicle, but its complexity, particularly the advanced air suspension and direct-injection engines (on later models), can lead to significant repair costs. Engine timing chain issues on the V8s and potential transmission control module problems are notable concerns. The air suspension system, while providing excellent comfort, is a common source of expensive repairs due to leaks or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MMI infotainment system, can also arise. Prospective buyers should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair expenses, and a thorough pre-purchase inspection focusing on these common failure points is highly recommended. Regular maintenance and addressing issues promptly are crucial for long-term reliability.
