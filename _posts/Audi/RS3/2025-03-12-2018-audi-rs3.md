**Summary**

The 2018 Audi RS3 is a powerful and engaging sports sedan, but it's not without its potential issues. Engine issues like turbocharger failure and carbon buildup can be costly, while transmission problems, particularly with the mechatronic unit or clutch packs, are also a concern. Electrical gremlins in the infotainment system and potential suspension issues with the adaptive dampers (if equipped) can add to the ownership costs. While some issues may be minor, others can be quite expensive to repair. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection done by a qualified Audi mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
