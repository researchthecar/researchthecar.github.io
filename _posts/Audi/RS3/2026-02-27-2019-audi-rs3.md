### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Audi RS3 is a highly capable performance vehicle with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The iconic 2.5L turbocharged engine is robust, though owners should be aware of potential coolant leaks and PCV system issues, which are not uncommon in high-performance turbocharged applications. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission, while offering rapid shifts, can sometimes exhibit harshness or require attention to its mechatronics unit. The adaptive suspension, a key feature for performance, can be a source of costly repairs if dampers fail. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Overall, the RS3 offers a thrilling driving experience, but potential buyers should factor in the possibility of maintenance costs associated with its performance-oriented nature and advanced technology.
