The 2024 Audi RS3 is a high-performance compact sedan celebrated for its exhilarating performance, distinctive styling, and advanced technology. It boasts a unique 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-5 engine, producing 401 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. It is a fun car, but some complain about the infotainment system being confusing and the ride being too firm for everyday driving. The car's tight handling and responsive engine are major highlights for enthusiasts. However, some find the car expensive and the interior styling too plain for a performance vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2024 Audi RS3, while a performance-oriented vehicle, presents a range of potential issues, from engine-related problems like turbo wastegate rattle and HPFP failure to transmission concerns involving the Mechatronic unit and clutch packs. Suspension and electrical glitches, particularly with adaptive dampers and the infotainment system, can also occur. Interior rattles, while minor, can be irritating. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely, with some repairs potentially reaching several thousand dollars, particularly those related to the transmission or adaptive suspension. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
