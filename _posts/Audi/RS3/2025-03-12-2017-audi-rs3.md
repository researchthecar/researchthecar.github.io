The 2017 Audi RS3 is a high-performance compact sedan that packs a punch with its turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-5 engine, producing 400 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. This engine is exclusively paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (S tronic). Owners typically rave about the RS3's exhilarating acceleration, sharp handling, and distinctive engine sound. Some common dislikes include its firm ride, relatively high price point, and potential for expensive maintenance.

**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Inline-5 (DAZA)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 2.5L in the RS3 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves due to the lack of fuel washing over them. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased performance, misfires, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: A manual cleaning process such as media blasting or walnut blasting is typically needed to remove the carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can fail prematurely. Symptoms include a loss of power, whistling noises from the engine bay, excessive smoke, and potentially an engine warning light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.5L engine can experience excessive oil consumption. This may require adding oil more frequently than usual.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a piston ring replacement may be necessary. In other cases, it could be related to turbocharger issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $5000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic (S tronic)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit (TCU) controls the transmission's shifting functions and can fail, leading to erratic shifting, delayed engagement, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Mechatronic unit is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the high performance nature of the RS3, the clutches within the dual-clutch transmission can wear out prematurely, especially with aggressive driving or modifications. Symptoms include slipping during acceleration, jerky shifts, and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The RS3 equipped with the magnetic ride control system may experience failures of the dampers (shocks). Symptoms include uneven ride height, knocking noises, and a noticeable decline in ride comfort and handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty MRC dampers is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, and connectivity problems with Bluetooth and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve the issues. In more severe cases, replacement of the MMI unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as parking sensors, can fail, resulting in inaccurate readings or complete malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2017 Audi RS3 is a thrilling performance car, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems like carbon buildup and turbocharger failure can be costly to address. Transmission issues with the Mechatronic unit and clutch wear are also potential concerns. Suspension issues are a possible issue with the magnetic ride control. Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system, can be frustrating. While the RS3 offers an engaging driving experience, owners should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair costs associated with its high-performance components. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor electrical glitches to significant engine and transmission repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the problem.
