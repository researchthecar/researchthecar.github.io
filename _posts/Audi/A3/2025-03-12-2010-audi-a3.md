The 2010 Audi A3 is a compact car offering a blend of practicality and luxury. It was available with a few different powertrain options. One popular choice was the 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 engine, producing around 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included the 3.2L VR6 engine, which produced around 250 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, and the 2.0L TDI diesel engine, which produced around 140 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were generally a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed DSG (Direct Shift Gearbox) dual-clutch automatic. Owners often praise the A3 for its sporty handling, upscale interior, and fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel). Common complaints revolve around potential maintenance costs, particularly with the DSG transmission and some electrical components. Some owners have mentioned the car's ride can be a bit firm on rough roads.
