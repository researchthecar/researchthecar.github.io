The 2006 Audi A3 is a premium compact car known for its sporty handling, upscale interior, and available quattro all-wheel drive. In the US market, the 2006 A3 was primarily offered with two engine options: the 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (200 hp and 207 lb-ft of torque) and the 3.2L VR6 (250 hp and 236 lb-ft of torque). The 2.0T came standard with a 6-speed manual transmission, and a 6-speed automatic transmission was optional. The 3.2L VR6 came standard with a 6-speed DSG (Direct Shift Gearbox) transmission. Owners generally appreciate the A3's responsive steering, comfortable ride, and premium feel. Common dislikes include higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles and potential issues with some of the electronic components.
