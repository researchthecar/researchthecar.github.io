**Introduction to the 1999 Audi A3**

The 1999 Audi A3 is a subcompact hatchback that was offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 1.6-liter inline-four that produced 101 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 1.8-liter inline-four that produced 125 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The A3 was praised for its sharp handling, comfortable interior, and fuel efficiency. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, especially when equipped with the 1.6-liter engine.
