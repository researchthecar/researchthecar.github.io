The 2008 Audi A3 is a compact car known for its sporty handling, premium interior, and available quattro all-wheel drive. Engine options included a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L VR6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0T engine was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed S-Tronic dual-clutch transmission (DSG), while the 3.2 VR6 was only offered with the S-Tronic DSG transmission. Owners often praised the A3 for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.0T), and upscale interior. Common complaints revolved around potential maintenance costs, especially as the car aged, and the complexity of the DSG transmission.
