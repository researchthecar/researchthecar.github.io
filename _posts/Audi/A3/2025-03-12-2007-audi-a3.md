The 2007 Audi A3 is a compact car known for its sporty handling, premium interior, and available quattro all-wheel drive. Engine options included a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (200 hp and 207 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.2L VR6 (250 hp and 236 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic (Tiptronic), and the DSG dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the A3's fuel economy (particularly with the 2.0T), its engaging driving experience, and its overall build quality. Common dislikes include potentially high repair costs, some reports of electrical gremlins, and a relatively small rear seat.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (BPY)**

*   **Cam Follower Failure (High-Pressure Fuel Pump)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cam follower that drives the high-pressure fuel pump (HPFP) can wear through, leading to reduced fuel pressure, rough running, misfires, and eventually engine damage. A ticking noise from the HPFP area is also common.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam follower with an updated version (revision F is recommended). Regularly inspect the follower. Upgrading to an aftermarket HPFP with a more robust follower design is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The diverter valve (also known as a blow-off valve on other cars) recirculates excess boost pressure. When it fails, it can cause a loss of boost, sluggish acceleration, and a check engine light. Early versions of the diverter valve were prone to diaphragm failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the diverter valve with an updated piston-type valve (like the revision D valve) for improved reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idle, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils. Replacing all four coils is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L VR6**

* No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Tiptronic)**
* No Issues Found

**DSG (Direct Shift Gearbox)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, delayed engagement, jerking, inability to select gears, transmission warning lights. This is a common issue with early DSG transmissions.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and alignment issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door not locking or unlocking properly, inability to open the door from the inside or outside.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof won't open/close, makes clicking noises, or gets stuck.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the sunroof motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges flickering or not working, display malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaches from the backing board and sags, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Re-glue the headliner fabric or replace the entire headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Audi A3, while a desirable car, has several potential issues owners should be aware of. The 2.0T engine is prone to cam follower wear, diverter valve failure, and ignition coil problems. The DSG transmission can suffer from expensive mechatronic unit failures. Suspension issues such as worn control arm bushings are also common. Electrical issues like door lock actuator failures, sunroof issues and instrument cluster issues can also occur. Interior issues such as headliner sagging are also a common problem to watch out for. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor to potentially very expensive to repair. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with Audi vehicles to identify any existing or potential problems.
