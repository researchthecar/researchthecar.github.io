### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Audi A3 (Mk2) presents a generally solid ownership proposition, but potential buyers should be aware of specific common issues. The TFSI petrol engines are prone to oil consumption and timing chain problems, while the TDI diesels can suffer from DMF and EGR issues. The DSG transmission, while offering smooth shifts, can be costly to repair if the mechatronics unit fails. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shock absorbers are typical wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and CAN bus errors, can also arise. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating repair costs and ensuring long-term reliability.
