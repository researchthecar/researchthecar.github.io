### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Audi A3 is a competent premium compact, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of specific common issues, particularly with the turbocharged TFSI engine and the DSG transmission. Carbon buildup and PCV issues are notable for the naturally aspirated FSI, while the TDI engines are generally more robust. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and infotainment glitches can occur.
