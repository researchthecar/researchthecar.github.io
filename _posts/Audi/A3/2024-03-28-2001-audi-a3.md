**Summary**

Overall, the 2001 Audi A3 is a reliable and enjoyable vehicle. However, like any vehicle, it is not immune to issues. The most common issues with the A3 include intake manifold failure (turbocharged engines), timing chain tensioner failure (non-turbocharged engines), clutch failure, and control arm bushing wear. While some of these issues can be expensive to fix, others are relatively inexpensive to repair.
