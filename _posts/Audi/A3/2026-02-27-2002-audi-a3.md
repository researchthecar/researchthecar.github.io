### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Audi A3 is a competent premium hatchback, but like many European cars of this era, it can develop specific issues as it ages. The petrol engines, particularly the TFSI variants, are prone to timing chain and PCV issues, while the TDI engines can face turbocharger wear and dual-mass flywheel problems. Transmission reliability varies, with the DSG automatic requiring more attention than the manual options. Suspension components like control arm bushings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and ABS sensors, can also occur. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the reliability of a 2002 Audi A3.
