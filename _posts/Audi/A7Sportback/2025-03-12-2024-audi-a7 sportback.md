The 2024 Audi A7 Sportback is a sleek and stylish luxury sedan known for its elegant design, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 261 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the A7's aesthetics, technology, and smooth ride, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's complexity and occasional glitches, as well as the high cost of maintenance and repairs. Some find the rear headroom limited due to the sloping roofline.
