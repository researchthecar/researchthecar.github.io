### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Audi A7 Sportback offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly in its standard mechanical components. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to its advanced technological features and optional sophisticated systems like the adaptive air suspension and the dual-clutch transmission. Issues such as oil leaks and PCV problems can occur with the 3.0L TFSI engine, and the S tronic transmission may require attention for its mechatronics unit or clutch packs. Electrical gremlins within the infotainment system and ADAS sensors are also noted. Despite these potential issues, which are not uncommon for vehicles with such advanced technology, the A7 Sportback remains a solid choice for those seeking a blend of performance, luxury, and style, provided regular maintenance and awareness of these specific potential repair areas are maintained.
