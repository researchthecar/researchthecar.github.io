### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Audi A6 Quattro is a capable luxury sedan, but potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with the V6 and V8 FSI engines, where timing chain tensioner issues and oil leaks are notable. Automatic transmission mechatronic unit failures can also be costly. While suspension components like control arm bushings may require attention with age, and electrical gremlins like MMI glitches can occur, the exterior and manual transmission variants tend to be more robust. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating repair costs and ensuring long-term reliability.
