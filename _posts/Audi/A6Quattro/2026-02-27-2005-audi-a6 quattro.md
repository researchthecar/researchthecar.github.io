### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Audi A6 Quattro is a capable luxury vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of its specific reliability concerns, particularly with the V6 and V8 FSI engines, where timing chain tensioner issues can be very costly. Automatic transmission mechatronic unit failures are also a notable concern. While the manual transmission and exterior/interior components are generally robust, the complexity of the electrical system and optional air suspension can lead to expensive repairs. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a budget for potential maintenance are highly recommended for this model.
