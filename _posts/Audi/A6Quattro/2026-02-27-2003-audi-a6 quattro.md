### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Audi A6 Quattro, while offering a premium experience, exhibits common reliability concerns for its age, particularly with its more complex engine options like the 2.7T and 4.2 V8, which can suffer from timing chain and PCV issues. The 3.0 V6 also has notable timing chain tensioner vulnerabilities. Automatic transmissions, especially the 5-speed, can experience torque converter and valve body problems. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and window regulators, are also reported. Suspension components like control arm bushings are wear items. Owners should be prepared for potentially significant repair costs, especially for engine and transmission work. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating major issues.
