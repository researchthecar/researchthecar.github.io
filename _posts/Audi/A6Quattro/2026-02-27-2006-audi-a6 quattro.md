### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Audi A6 Quattro is a capable luxury sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with the V6 and V8 FSI engines, where timing chain tensioner issues are a significant concern. Automatic transmission mechatronic unit failures and torque converter problems are also notable. While the manual transmission and exterior components are generally robust, electrical gremlins, especially related to CAN bus communication and MFI displays, can arise. Suspension components, particularly air suspension if equipped, can also be a source of costly repairs. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a budget for potential repairs are highly recommended for this model.
