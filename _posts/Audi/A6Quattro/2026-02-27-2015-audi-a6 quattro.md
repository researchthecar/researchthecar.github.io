### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi A6 Quattro is a well-built vehicle with a generally positive reliability record. The most common areas requiring attention tend to be related to the powertrain, particularly oil consumption in the 2.0L TFSI engine and potential issues with the mechatronic units or clutch packs in the S tronic transmission. The 3.0L TFSI is generally more robust but can experience supercharger belt or PCV valve issues. Suspension, especially air suspension systems, can be a source of costly repairs if leaks develop. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the MMI infotainment system, are not uncommon. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to early warning signs, the A6 Quattro can provide a reliable and luxurious ownership experience.
