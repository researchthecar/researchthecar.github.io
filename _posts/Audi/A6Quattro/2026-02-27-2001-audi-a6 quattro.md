### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Audi A6 Quattro, while offering a luxurious and capable driving experience, presents several potential reliability concerns, particularly with its engines and transmissions. The twin-turbo V6 is prone to costly timing belt failures and turbo issues, while the naturally aspirated V6 also requires diligent timing belt maintenance and is susceptible to oil and coolant leaks. Automatic transmissions can suffer from torque converter and valve body problems. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and ignition system, are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out. Owners should be prepared for potentially significant repair costs, especially for engine and transmission work. Regular and thorough maintenance, particularly concerning the timing belt, is paramount to mitigating some of these issues.
