The 2016 Audi A6 Quattro is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a blend of performance, comfort, and technology. It's generally praised for its elegant interior, smooth ride, and available Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Owners often appreciate the car's refined driving experience and advanced features. However, some common dislikes include higher maintenance costs, potential for electrical issues, and the complexity of the infotainment system. The 2016 A6 Quattro offers several engine options, including a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (252 hp, 273 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L supercharged V6 (333 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque), and a high-performance 4.0L twin-turbo V8 (450 hp, 406 lb-ft of torque) in the S6 model. The 2016 A6 Quattro's come equipped with either an 8-speed automatic transmission or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission depending on the engine type.

**Summary**

The 2016 Audi A6 Quattro, while generally a well-regarded luxury sedan, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the 2.0L and supercharger/PCV issues in the 3.0L, can be costly to address. Transmission issues, especially with the dual-clutch unit on the S6, are another potential concern. Electrical problems, especially with the infotainment system, are also common. Air suspension issues (if equipped) can add to the maintenance burden. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant repair bills. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
