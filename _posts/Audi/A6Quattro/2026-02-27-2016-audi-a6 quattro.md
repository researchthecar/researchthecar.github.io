### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Audi A6 Quattro generally presents good reliability, especially in its powertrain and chassis components. However, owners should be aware of potential issues related to oil consumption and PCV valve failures on the 2.0L TFSI engine, and PCV valve issues on the 3.0L TFSI. The automatic transmissions, particularly the S tronic dual-clutch, can be prone to mechatronic unit and clutch pack wear, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as MMI system glitches and lighting control module failures, are also noted. Regular maintenance, adherence to service intervals, and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the long-term reliability and value of this luxury sedan.
