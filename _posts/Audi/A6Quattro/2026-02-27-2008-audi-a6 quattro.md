### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Audi A6 Quattro is a capable luxury sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The gasoline engines, particularly the V8, can be prone to costly timing chain and oil consumption issues. Automatic transmission problems, such as mechatronic unit failures, are also a significant concern. While the suspension is generally robust, optional air suspension systems can develop leaks. Electrical gremlins, especially with the MMI system, and interior issues like clogged sunroof drains are also reported. Regular maintenance and pre-purchase inspections are crucial, with a focus on these known problem areas to ensure long-term reliability and avoid unexpected repair bills.
