### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Audi A6 Quattro is a capable luxury sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with the V6 and V8 FSI engines, where timing chain tensioner issues and oil consumption can be costly. Automatic transmission problems, such as mechatronic unit failures, are also noted. While the suspension and electrical systems are generally robust, air suspension components (if equipped) can be a source of expense. The exterior and interior components are typically reliable. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early warning signs are crucial for mitigating these potential issues and ensuring long-term satisfaction with the vehicle.
