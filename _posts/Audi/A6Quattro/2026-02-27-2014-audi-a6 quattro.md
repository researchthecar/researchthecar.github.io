### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Audi A6 Quattro is a well-built luxury sedan with a generally positive reliability record. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the engine's oil consumption on the 2.0L TFSI, and potential issues with the timing chain tensioner. The 3.0L TFSI, while powerful, can also experience PCV valve or supercharger-related concerns. Automatic transmission issues, particularly with the mechatronics unit or torque converter, are noted but not universal. Suspension components, especially on models with air suspension, can be costly to repair if they fail. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the MMI system or LED headlight modules, are also documented. Overall, the A6 Quattro offers a premium experience, but owners should be prepared for potential repair costs associated with its advanced technology and performance-oriented components.
