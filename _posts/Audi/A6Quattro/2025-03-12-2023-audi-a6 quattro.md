The 2023 Audi A6 Quattro is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its refined driving experience, sophisticated technology, and elegant design. While the A6 offers a blend of comfort and performance that many owners appreciate, some common issues have surfaced. The 2023 A6 Quattro typically comes equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 261 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque or a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine producing 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed S-Tronic dual-clutch transmission. Common praises for the A6 include its comfortable interior, advanced technology features, and smooth ride. However, some owners have expressed concerns about the reliability of certain electronic components and the sometimes-complex infotainment system.

**Summary**

The 2023 Audi A6 Quattro, while generally a well-regarded luxury sedan, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Oil consumption in the 2.0L engine and transmission issues in the 7-speed S-Tronic transmission can be costly to repair if they arise. Electrical issues such as infotainment glitches and sensor malfunctions can also be frustrating. The air suspension on equipped vehicles is another area of potential concern. While not every A6 Quattro will experience these problems, understanding these potential issues can help buyers make an informed decision and budget accordingly for potential repairs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars for software updates to several thousand for engine or transmission work.
