### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Audi A6 Quattro is a capable luxury sedan, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The V6 and V8 engines, particularly the biturbo and 3.0L variants, are prone to oil leaks and timing chain-related problems, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions, especially the 5-speed Tiptronic, can develop shifting issues and mechatronic problems. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and window regulator failures, are also reported. While suspension components like control arm bushings can wear, they are generally less problematic than the powertrain or electrical systems. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of trouble are key to managing ownership costs for this generation of A6.
