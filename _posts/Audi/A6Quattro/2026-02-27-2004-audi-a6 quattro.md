### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Audi A6 Quattro offers a compelling luxury sedan experience, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of its specific reliability quirks. The V6 and V8 engines, while powerful, can be prone to issues like PCV failures, oil leaks, and in the V8, critical timing chain tensioner problems, which are costly to repair. Automatic transmissions can develop torque converter or valve body issues. Suspension components, particularly control arm bushings, are common wear items. Electrically, the Body Control Module and ignition coils are known to cause problems. While exterior and interior issues are generally less severe, they can still be inconvenient and costly. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for managing the long-term reliability and ownership costs of this vehicle.
