### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Audi A6 Quattro is a capable luxury sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with the V6 and V8 FSI engines, where timing chain tensioner issues and oil consumption can be costly. The automatic transmission's mechatronic unit and torque converter are also points of concern. While the suspension and electrical systems are generally robust, issues with air suspension (if equipped) and the MMI infotainment system can arise. The manual transmission and exterior components are typically reliable. Addressing these potential issues proactively through thorough pre-purchase inspections and budgeting for repairs can contribute to a more positive ownership experience.
