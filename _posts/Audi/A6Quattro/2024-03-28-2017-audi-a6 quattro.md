**Transmission**

* **7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Transmission**
    * **Clutch Pack Wear:** The clutch packs in the transmission can experience premature wear, which can lead to slipping gears, delayed shifts, and shuddering. The transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
