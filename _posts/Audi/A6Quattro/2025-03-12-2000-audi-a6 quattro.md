The 2000 Audi A6 Quattro is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, elegant styling, and standard all-wheel-drive system. Available engine options include a 2.8L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.2L V8 producing 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual, depending on the engine. Owners generally appreciate the car's solid build quality, luxurious interior, and sure-footed handling in various weather conditions. However, some common complaints include the high cost of maintenance and repairs, the complexity of the electrical system, and the potential for certain mechanical issues to arise as the car ages.

**Summary**

The 2000 Audi A6 Quattro, while a comfortable and stylish vehicle, is prone to a number of issues, particularly as it ages. Engine oil and coolant leaks are common across both engine options, and the V8 is susceptible to costly timing belt failures if maintenance is neglected. The automatic transmission can experience torque converter and valve body problems. Suspension issues, such as control arm bushing and tie rod end failure, are also prevalent. Electrical problems, like instrument cluster pixel failure and window regulator issues, are common. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but owners should be prepared for potentially high repair bills, especially given the age of the vehicle.
