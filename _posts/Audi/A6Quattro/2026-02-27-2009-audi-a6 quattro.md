### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Audi A6 Quattro is a capable luxury sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with the V8 engine's timing chain and oil consumption, and potential issues with the automatic transmission's mechatronic unit. While the V6 engines are generally more reliable, they can suffer from PCV valve failures and oil leaks. Suspension components, especially air springs if equipped, and certain electrical gremlins like MMI glitches are also points to consider. Regular maintenance and thorough pre-purchase inspections are crucial for mitigating these risks and ensuring long-term ownership satisfaction.
