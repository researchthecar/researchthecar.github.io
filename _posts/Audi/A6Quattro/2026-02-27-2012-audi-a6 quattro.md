### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Audi A6 Quattro is a well-built luxury sedan, but like many German vehicles of this era, it can present specific technical challenges. The most notable concerns revolve around the gasoline engines, particularly the 2.0L TFSI, with oil consumption and timing chain issues being primary worries. The automatic transmissions are generally robust, though mechatronic unit and torque converter problems can arise. Optional air suspension systems, while offering superior comfort, are prone to leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MMI infotainment system, and interior component failures like blend door actuators are also reported. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential issues and ensuring long-term reliability.
