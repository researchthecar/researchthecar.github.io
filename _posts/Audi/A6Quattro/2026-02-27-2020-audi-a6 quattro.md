### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Audi A6 Quattro demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its powertrain components.

These electrical issues often manifest as software-related problems that can typically be resolved with updates. While the standard chassis and core engine/transmission options are robust, potential buyers should be aware of the higher potential repair costs associated with the air suspension and complex electronic features. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning lights are recommended.
