**Summary**

The 2021 Audi A6 Quattro, while a luxurious and well-regarded vehicle, does have a few common problem areas. Engine coolant leaks and transmission shifting issues are the most prominent. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and sensors are also relatively common. Suspension issues, mainly air suspension problems, are mostly only applicable to models equipped with that option. While the issues are not necessarily catastrophic, they can be expensive to repair due to the car's sophisticated components and systems. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and have the vehicle inspected before purchase.
