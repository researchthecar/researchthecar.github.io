### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Audi A6 Quattro generally presents good reliability, particularly in its core mechanical components when properly maintained. However, owners should be aware of potential issues related to oil consumption and timing chain wear on the 2.0L TFSI engine, and mechatronic unit or clutch pack concerns in the S tronic dual-clutch transmission. The 3.0L TFSI V6 is more robust but can experience PCV system issues. The air suspension, while offering a comfortable ride, can be a significant expense if it develops leaks. Electrical gremlins, especially with the MMI system and LED headlights, are also noted. Regular servicing and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for mitigating repair costs and ensuring long-term dependability.
