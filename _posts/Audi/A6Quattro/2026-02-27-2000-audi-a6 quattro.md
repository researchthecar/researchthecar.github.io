### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Audi A6 Quattro is a capable luxury vehicle, but potential buyers and owners should be aware of common issues, particularly concerning the 2.7L twin-turbo engine's oil leaks and PCV system, as well as potential transmission problems like fluid leaks and torque converter issues. Electrical components, such as the instrument cluster and window regulators, can also be points of failure. While suspension and exterior/interior components have reported issues, they are generally less critical than powertrain or electrical concerns. Regular maintenance, especially timely timing belt replacement and fluid changes, is crucial for mitigating these potential reliability concerns and ensuring the longevity of the vehicle.
