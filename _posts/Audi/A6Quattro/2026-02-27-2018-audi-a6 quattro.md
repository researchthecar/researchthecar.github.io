### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Audi A6 Quattro generally presents a solid reliability record, especially for its luxury segment. The most frequently cited issues tend to revolve around the 2.0L TFSI engine's oil consumption and PCV system, and potential problems with the 8-speed automatic transmission's mechatronic unit or torque converter. Air suspension systems, while offering a superior ride, can be a source of costly repairs if leaks develop. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the MMI infotainment system, are not uncommon in modern Audis. Exterior and interior components are generally robust, with isolated issues like headlight failures or HVAC actuator problems being the main concerns. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for mitigating potential repair costs and ensuring long-term dependability.
