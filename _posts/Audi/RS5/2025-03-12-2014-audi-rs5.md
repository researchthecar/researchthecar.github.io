The 2014 Audi RS5 is a high-performance coupe known for its naturally aspirated V8 engine, sharp handling, and luxurious interior. It came exclusively with a 4.2-liter V8 engine producing 450 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed S-tronic dual-clutch transmission. Drivers appreciate the RS5's thrilling engine sound, responsive handling, and elegant design. However, some common complaints include the relatively high running costs, firm ride quality, and the complexity of the dual-clutch transmission, which can sometimes lead to jerky low-speed behavior.

**Engine**

**4.2L FSI V8**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct-injection engines like the 4.2L V8 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over the valves. This buildup restricts airflow, leading to reduced power, rough idling, misfires, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: A manual cleaning of the intake valves is typically required, often involving media blasting or walnut blasting to remove the carbon deposits. Chemical cleaners can also be used, but may not be as effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption in the 4.2L V8 engine. The issue can stem from worn piston rings or valve stem seals. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently, blue smoke from the exhaust, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: The appropriate solution varies. A leak-down test can help identify if piston rings or valve stem seals are the cause. Replacing the worn parts can be very expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S-Tronic Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit controls the shifting functions of the S-tronic transmission. Failure can lead to erratic shifting, delayed engagement, difficulty selecting gears, or complete transmission failure. Warning lights on the dash might also appear.
    *   Solution: The mechatronic unit needs to be replaced or rebuilt. In some cases, a software update may temporarily alleviate the issue, but a replacement is often necessary for a long-term fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: As a dual-clutch transmission, the S-tronic relies on clutches to engage and disengage gears. These clutches can wear out over time, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping during acceleration, jerky shifts, and shuddering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutches is the only solution. This is a labor-intensive job that requires specialized tools and expertise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DRC system helps to minimize body roll and improve handling. The accumulators in the system can fail, leading to leaks and a loss of damping ability. This results in a bouncy or unstable ride, especially in corners.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed DRC accumulators is the standard fix. Some owners opt to replace the entire DRC system with aftermarket coilovers for improved performance and reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: DRC Accumulator Replacement $1,500 - $3,000+, Aftermarket Coilovers $2,000 - $4,000+ (including installation)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/MMI System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Multi Media Interface (MMI) system can experience a range of issues, including freezing, slow response times, screen malfunctions, and Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve the issue. However, hardware failures may require replacing the MMI unit or individual components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (if available) may be free or low cost, MMI unit replacement $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Adaptive Headlight Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adaptive headlights can sometimes malfunction, displaying error messages on the dash. Issues might include the lights not leveling correctly or failing to adjust to steering inputs.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause is crucial. It could be a faulty headlight motor, sensor, or wiring issue. Replacement of the affected component is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on the part that needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Audi RS5, while offering impressive performance and luxury, can be prone to some notable issues. The carbon buildup and oil consumption issues with the 4.2L V8 can be costly to address. Similarly, potential mechatronic unit or clutch failures in the S-tronic transmission can lead to significant repair bills. The DRC suspension system is another area where failures can occur. While less severe, electrical issues with the MMI system and adaptive headlights can be frustrating. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their ownership considerations, including budgeting for preventative maintenance and potential repairs.
