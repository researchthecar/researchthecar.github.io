**Introduction:**

The 2015 Audi RS5 is a high-performance coupe that offers an exhilarating driving experience. It is equipped with a powerful 4.2-liter V8 engine that produces 450 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The RS5 is praised for its aggressive styling, impressive performance, and luxurious interior, but some owners have reported specific issues with their vehicles.

**Engine**

**4.2L V8**

* **Carbon buildup on intake valves:** This can cause a loss of power, decreased fuel efficiency, and rough running. The solution involves removing the intake manifold and cleaning the valves. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** This can lead to a rattling noise from the engine, reduced power, and eventually catastrophic engine failure. The solution requires replacing the timing chain tensioner and the timing chain. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
* **Piston ring failure:** This can result in excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, and reduced engine power. The solution involves replacing the piston rings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
* **Recalls:** NHTSA Campaign Number: 17V374000. This recall addresses a potential issue where the engine control module may not be properly calibrated, causing the engine to stall.

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

* **Shifting hesitation or jerkiness:** This can be caused by a faulty transmission control module or clutch packs. The solution involves updating the transmission software or replacing the faulty components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Clutch slipping:** This can occur when the clutch packs become worn or contaminated with debris. The solution involves replacing the clutch packs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
* **Recalls:** None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear suspension noise:** This can be caused by worn or damaged rear control arms or bushings. The solution involves replacing the affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** This can be caused by a faulty alternator, starter, or parasitic draw from an electrical component. The solution involves testing and replacing the affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
* **Electrical shorts:** These can cause various electrical malfunctions, such as flickering lights, dashboard warning lights, or loss of power. The solution involves diagnosing and repairing the faulty wiring or components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+

* **HVAC system malfunction:** This can result in poor heating or cooling performance. The solution involves diagnosing and repairing the faulty components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
* **Recalls:** None Found

**Summary:**

Overall, the 2015 Audi RS5 is known for its impressive performance and luxury, but it has been subject to several specific issues. The most significant and costly issues relate to the engine, including carbon buildup and timing chain tensioner failure.
