The 2016 Audi RS5 is a high-performance coupe known for its powerful engine, sporty handling, and luxurious interior. It came equipped with a naturally aspirated 4.2-liter V8 engine producing 450 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally appreciate the RS5 for its exhilarating acceleration, distinctive exhaust note, and stylish design. Common complaints often revolve around the car's relatively firm ride, especially on rough roads, and its relatively high running costs.

**Engine**

**4.2L V8**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 4.2L V8 in the RS5 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves. This occurs because there is no fuel washing the intake valves to clean them, and there is only air and oil vapors going over the valves. Symptoms include rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: A manual cleaning of the intake valves through walnut blasting or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4.2L V8 engine, while powerful, is known to consume oil at a higher rate than some other engines. The symptoms are excessive oil consumption (more than 1 quart per 1,000 miles), low oil level warning lights, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not monitored and maintained.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the PCV valve can help. More extreme cases may require piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV Valve) - $5000+ (Piston Rings)

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit is the control module for the S tronic transmission. Failure can cause harsh shifting, failure to shift, error messages on the dashboard, and limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Mechatronic unit or, in some cases, rebuilding it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dual-clutch transmissions can experience clutch wear over time, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping during acceleration, jerky shifts, and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+

**Suspension**

*   **Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The RS5's Dynamic Ride Control system, designed to reduce body roll and improve handling, is known to have leaks or failures in its hydraulic dampers. Symptoms include fluid leaks, a noticeable decrease in handling performance, and a bouncy or unstable ride.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking DRC dampers or complete DRC system overhaul. Some owners opt for aftermarket coilover suspension kits to eliminate the DRC system entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $6000+ (depending on the extent of the repairs and whether aftermarket solutions are chosen)

**Electrical**

*   **Parking Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The parking sensors will fail from debris and grime getting into the sensor causing it to become inaccurate and fail. Common symptoms are constant beeping while driving or reversing, or no sound at all while parking.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty parking sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/MMI System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Multi Media Interface system may have issues such as screen freezing or not responding, Bluetooth connectivity problems, or Navigation failures.
    *   Solution: Resetting the MMI system, software updates, or replacement of the MMI control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software Update) - $1500+ (MMI Replacement)

**Exterior**

*   **Adaptive Headlight Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adaptive headlights, which swivel to illuminate curves, can sometimes malfunction. This can manifest as error messages, headlights not swiveling correctly, or one or both headlights failing to function.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to determine the cause (motor failure, control module issue, etc.) followed by replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+

**Recalls**
*   **Fuel Leak**
     * Description/Symptoms: A fuel leak can occur near the fuel rail on the engine due to the fuel rail not being properly machined. Symptoms are a gas smell inside the cabin or near the engine bay.
     * Solution: Take the vehicle to the dealer to have the fuel rails replaced.
     * Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under warranty, typically free.
     * Recalls: 20V071000

**Summary**

The 2016 Audi RS5 is a performance car that comes with a few potential issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine (carbon buildup and oil consumption) and transmission (Mechatronic unit and clutch wear). The DRC suspension is also prone to failure and can be costly to repair. Electrical and MMI glitches can be frustrating but are generally less expensive to address. The fuel leak recall should be addressed. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in the cost of potential repairs when considering purchasing a used 2016 Audi RS5.
