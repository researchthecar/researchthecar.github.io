# 2015 Audi RS5

### Overview
The 2015 Audi RS5, a high-performance variant of the A5, is generally regarded as a mechanically robust vehicle, particularly given its potent powertrain. It features a naturally aspirated 4.2-liter V8 engine paired with either a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission or, in some markets, a 6-speed manual. While the RS5 offers exhilarating performance, like any performance-oriented vehicle, it can experience specific issues related to its advanced systems. Owners should be aware of potential concerns primarily centered around the engine's high-revving nature and the sophisticated transmission. Regular maintenance is crucial to ensure longevity and optimal performance.

### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Audi RS5 is a compelling performance car with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The naturally aspirated V8 engine, while a joy to rev, can exhibit higher-than-average oil consumption and is susceptible to carbon buildup, requiring diligent maintenance. The S tronic dual-clutch transmission, while quick-shifting, has known potential issues with its mechatronic unit and clutch packs, which can be costly to repair. The manual transmission variant is typically more straightforward. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, can occur. Overall, the RS5 offers a thrilling driving experience, but potential buyers should factor in the possibility of maintenance costs associated with its high-performance nature, especially concerning the engine and transmission.
