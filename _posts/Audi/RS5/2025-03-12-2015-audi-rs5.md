The 2015 Audi RS5 is a performance coupe renowned for its powerful engine, sleek design, and luxurious interior. This model year came standard with a high-revving 4.2-liter V8 engine producing 450 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the RS5 for its exhilarating acceleration, distinctive exhaust note, and capable handling. Criticisms generally revolve around its firm ride, dated infotainment system, and relatively high running costs.

**Engine**

**4.2L V8 FSI**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct-injection engines like the 4.2L V8 are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, as there is no fuel washing over them. This can lead to rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) or chemical cleaning. Installation of an oil catch can can help mitigate future buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ depending on the shop and cleaning method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 4.2L V8 engines in the RS5 have been known to consume excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes.
    *   Solution: The cause of excessive oil consumption can vary, often due to piston ring issues. Repair options can range from a simple oil separator replacement to more extensive engine work (piston ring replacement).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the source of the oil consumption and the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit controls the shifting of the dual-clutch transmission. Failure can result in erratic shifting, hesitation, difficulty engaging gears, or complete transmission failure. Warning lights may appear on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: As a dual-clutch transmission, the S tronic relies on clutch packs to engage gears. Over time and with aggressive driving, these clutches can wear, leading to slipping, jerky shifts, and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Dynamic Ride Control system uses hydraulically interconnected dampers to reduce body roll and improve handling. Leaks in the DRC system or failure of the dampers can result in poor handling, a bouncy ride, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking dampers or lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system can experience a range of issues, including freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and display malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In more severe cases, the MMI control unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for software update. $500 - $2000+ for unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck or fail to close properly. Can make noises such as cracking or popping sounds.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the sunroof track or replacement of a faulty motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **DRL (Daytime Running Light) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LED daytime running lights can fail, either partially or completely. This is a common issue with LED lighting systems in various vehicles.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected DRL unit or the entire headlight assembly, depending on the design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the unit to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Audi RS5, while a desirable performance car, has several potential problem areas. Engine-related issues like carbon buildup and oil consumption on the 4.2L V8 can be costly to address. The S tronic transmission may also experience issues with the mechatronic unit or clutch wear, potentially leading to significant repair bills. Suspension problems with the DRC system and electrical glitches with the infotainment system can also occur. While some issues may be minor, others can be severe and expensive to fix, so a thorough inspection before purchase is recommended.
