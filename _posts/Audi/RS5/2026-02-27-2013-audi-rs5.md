## Engine

### 4.2L V8 (Naturally Aspirated)
**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil consumption between scheduled changes, potentially leading to low oil levels.
- **Solution:** Regular oil level checks and top-ups. In severe cases, internal engine inspection and potential component replacement.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $3,000+

**Carbon Buildup**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced engine performance, rough idling, potential misfires.
- **Solution:** Intake manifold cleaning, walnut blasting of intake valves.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1,500


## Transmission

### 7-Speed S tronic (Dual-Clutch Automatic)
**Mechatronics Unit Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Harsh shifting, transmission warning lights, inability to engage gears.
- **Solution:** Replacement or repair of the mechatronics unit.
- **Cost:** $2,500 - $5,000+

**Clutch Pack Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping gears, rough engagement, delayed shifts.
- **Solution:** Replacement of clutch packs.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $4,000


## Suspension

### Adaptive Damping System
**Damper Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Harsh ride, clunking noises, uneven tire wear, warning lights.
- **Solution:** Replacement of faulty dampers.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1,500 per corner


## Electrical

### Infotainment System
**Screen Glitches/Freezing**
- **Symptoms:** Infotainment screen becomes unresponsive, displays errors, or freezes.
- **Solution:** Software updates, potential head unit replacement.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2,000


### Parking Sensors

### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Audi RS5 is a capable performance car with a generally robust mechanical foundation. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to its high-performance V8 engine, specifically oil consumption and potential carbon buildup, and the sophisticated S tronic dual-clutch transmission, which can experience issues with its mechatronics unit and clutch packs. The adaptive suspension can also present repair costs if dampers fail. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parking sensors, are not uncommon. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance and repair costs associated with a luxury performance vehicle, especially concerning the powertrain and advanced electronic systems.
