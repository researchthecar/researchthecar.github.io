Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2002 Audi RS4, broken down by category. The 2002 Audi RS4, a high-performance variant of the Audi A4, was only available with a single engine and transmission configuration: a 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. This engine produced 380 horsepower and 324 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally love the RS4 for its exceptional performance, unique styling, and all-wheel-drive grip. Common dislikes center around its relatively high running costs, the age of the vehicle leading to more frequent maintenance, and the potential for expensive repairs due to its complex engine.

**Engine**

**2.7L Twin-Turbo V6 (ASJ)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the engine bay, loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust. Often caused by bearing failure in the turbocharger due to oil starvation or degradation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger(s). It's often recommended to replace both turbos at the same time to ensure balanced performance and avoid future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on whether one or both turbos are replaced and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, low oil level. Common leak areas include valve cover gaskets, cam chain tensioner seals, and turbo oil lines.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets and seals. Careful inspection of the turbo oil lines for cracks or damage is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant spots under the car, sweet coolant smell, overheating. Common leak areas include the coolant reservoir, hoses, and water pump.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking components. Pressure testing the cooling system can help identify the source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the source of the leak).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **MAF (Mass Air Flow) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor idle, hesitation during acceleration, decreased fuel economy, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual (DRZ)**

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears, especially 2nd and 3rd. This is due to wear on the synchros, which are responsible for matching the speeds of the gears during shifting.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. A rebuild involves disassembling the transmission and replacing the worn synchros.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **DRC (Dynamic Ride Control) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking fluid from the dampers, uneven ride height, poor handling, bouncy ride. The DRC system is a hydraulically interconnected damper system that provides adjustable damping.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking dampers and/or accumulators. Some owners opt to replace the entire DRC system with conventional coilover suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on whether individual components are replaced or the entire system is converted).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially over bumps, vague steering, uneven tire wear. The control arm bushings wear out over time, leading to play in the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the number of bushings replaced and whether the entire control arm is replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixel Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Missing or distorted pixels on the instrument cluster display, making it difficult to read information.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window not going up or down, grinding noises when operating the window.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Fog Light Lens Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fog light lenses cracking or shattering due to thermal stress or impacts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fog light assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2002 Audi RS4, while a fantastic performance car, is prone to several age-related issues. Engine and suspension problems, particularly turbocharger failure and DRC system issues, can be quite expensive to address. Electrical problems such as pixel failure are common, but less costly to repair. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect any RS4 for these potential problems and factor in the cost of maintenance and repairs when making a purchase decision.
