The 2007 Audi RS4 is a high-performance sports sedan equipped with a naturally aspirated 4.2-liter V8 engine producing 420 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. It came exclusively with a 6-speed manual transmission and Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system. Owners generally praise the RS4 for its exhilarating performance, engaging driving experience, and distinctive styling. Criticisms often include relatively high running costs due to fuel consumption, maintenance, and the age of the vehicle now.

**Engine**

**4.2L V8**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the RS4's are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves. This restricts airflow, leading to reduced power, rough idling, poor fuel economy, and potentially misfires.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning (walnut blasting) of the intake valves is the most common solution. Chemical cleaning methods exist but are less effective. Installing an oil catch can can help reduce future buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **DRC (Dynamic Ride Control) Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking shocks, clunking noises, reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the entire DRC system or converting to a coilover suspension system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+ (DRC replacement), $2000 - $4000+ (Coilover Conversion)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from valve cover gaskets, oil cooler lines, or rear main seal. Visible oil drips or spots under the car and/or burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. For oil cooler lines, replacement is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the location and severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points in the system including hoses, coolant reservoir or the infamous "Valley Pan" under the intake manifold. Low coolant level, overheating, or visible leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking hoses, reservoir, or the valley pan gasket with an updated part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1200+ (Valley Pan)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Adjusters**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noises from the engine, especially at idle, can indicate worn camshaft adjusters. This can eventually lead to performance issues and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft adjusters and potentially associated timing chain components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, or clutch pedal sticking.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement including pressure plate, disc, and potentially the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly when cold.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement of worn synchros.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **DRC (Dynamic Ride Control) Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking shocks, clunking noises, reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the entire DRC system or converting to a coilover suspension system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+ (DRC replacement), $2000 - $4000+ (Coilover Conversion)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on the arms being replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen (O2) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, and potential performance issues.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty O2 sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixels Failing**
    * Description/Symptoms: Pixels in the display will fade or go out.
    * Solution: Replacing the entire instrument cluster, or rebuilding the current one to replace the display.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaches from the backing board and sags down.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headliner fabric and possibly the backing board.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Audi RS4, while a highly desirable performance vehicle, is prone to several age-related issues. The most significant are engine-related, particularly carbon buildup and DRC suspension failure, both of which can be costly to address. Other issues such as oil/coolant leaks and clutch wear are typical for a vehicle of this age and performance level. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in maintenance costs when considering a purchase. The severity of these issues ranges from annoying (headliner sag) to potentially engine-damaging (carbon buildup, camshaft adjusters). Costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for major overhauls.
