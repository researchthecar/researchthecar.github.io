The 2008 Audi RS4 is a high-performance sports sedan equipped with a naturally aspirated 4.2-liter V8 engine producing 420 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. It was only offered with a 6-speed manual transmission, sending power to all four wheels via Audi's Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Owners generally appreciate the RS4 for its exhilarating engine, precise handling, and understated styling. Common complaints include the high cost of maintenance, fuel consumption, and the susceptibility of certain components to failure due to the high-performance nature of the vehicle.

**Engine**

**4.2L V8 FSI**
*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, restricting airflow and reducing performance. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and a loss of power, particularly at lower RPMs.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves by walnut blasting is the most common solution. Chemical cleaners are also available, but may not be as effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 4.2L V8 engines in the RS4 exhibit excessive oil consumption, which may be caused by worn valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Solution: Replacing valve stem seals or piston rings is the typical solution. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **DRC Suspension Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Dynamic Ride Control suspension uses hydraulic lines connected to each corner of the vehicle. The hydraulic lines have been known to leak.
    *   Solution: Replace the hydraulic lines and struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The coolant lines in the vehicle run through the engine bay. They are known to leak over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the coolant lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injectors are known to fail at a relatively high rate, causing misfires, rough running, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per injector, or $1,200 - $2,400 for all injectors.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**
*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory clutch can wear out relatively quickly, especially with aggressive driving. Slipping, difficulty shifting, and a high clutch pedal engagement point are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch assembly with either a factory replacement or an upgraded aftermarket clutch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DRC system, which links the dampers diagonally, is prone to leaks and failures. Symptoms include uneven handling, excessive body roll, and fluid leaks from the dampers.
    *   Solution: Replace the DRC dampers and accumulators. Many owners opt to replace the entire DRC system with aftermarket coilover suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (DRC replacement), $2,000 - $4,000+ (Coilover conversion)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen (O2) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: O2 sensors fail, leading to poor fuel economy, check engine light, and potential catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty O2 sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Alternators have been known to fail prematurely, causing electrical issues, battery drain, and starting problems.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
