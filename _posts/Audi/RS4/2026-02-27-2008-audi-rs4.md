## Engine

### 4.2L V8 (Naturally Aspirated)
**Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup; check engine light; potential for catastrophic engine damage if ignored.
- **Solution:** Replacement of timing chain tensioners, guides, and potentially the chains themselves. This is a labor-intensive job.
- **Cost:** $3,000 - $6,000+

**Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced engine power, rough idle, decreased fuel efficiency, misfires.
- **Solution:** Intake manifold removal and walnut blasting or chemical cleaning of intake valves.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1,500

**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Frequent need to top up engine oil; blue smoke from exhaust under acceleration.
- **Solution:** Can be due to worn piston rings or valve stem seals. May require engine rebuild or specific repairs.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $7,000+


## Transmission

### 6-Speed Manual
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Replacement of clutch kit (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $1,200 - $2,000


### 6-Speed Tiptronic Automatic
**Torque Converter Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Shuddering at low speeds, delayed engagement, slipping.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the torque converter.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $2,500


## Suspension

### Adaptive Damping System (ADS)
**Faulty Dampers**

### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Audi RS4 is a highly desirable performance car, but its complexity means potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 4.2L V8 engine, while powerful, is prone to issues like timing chain tensioner failure and carbon buildup, which can be costly to repair. Transmission reliability is generally good for both manual and automatic variants, though clutch wear on manuals and torque converter issues on automatics are noted. The adaptive suspension can be a source of expense if dampers fail. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and infotainment glitches, are also reported. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and awareness of common problems, the RS4 can remain a rewarding ownership experience.
