# 2007 Audi RS4

### Overview
The 2007 Audi RS4, a high-performance variant of the B7 generation, is renowned for its potent 4.2L V8 engine and sophisticated all-wheel-drive system. While offering exhilarating driving dynamics, like many performance vehicles of its era, it is not without its potential reliability concerns. Owners often report issues related to the engine's carbon buildup, the timing chain system, and the oil consumption. The manual transmission is generally robust, but the clutch can be a wear item under hard use. Suspension components, particularly the DRC (Dynamic Ride Control) system, can require attention. Electrical gremlins and interior wear are also noted, though less frequently than powertrain issues. Careful maintenance and addressing common problems proactively are key to maintaining this enthusiast's car.
