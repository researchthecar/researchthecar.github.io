The 2022 Audi SQ5 is a performance-oriented compact SUV offering a blend of luxury, practicality, and driving engagement. The standard and only engine option is a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine that produces 349 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with an eight-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the SQ5 for its brisk acceleration, comfortable ride, upscale interior, and user-friendly technology. Some criticisms include its relatively high price point and the sometimes-firm ride quality with the optional adaptive suspension.
