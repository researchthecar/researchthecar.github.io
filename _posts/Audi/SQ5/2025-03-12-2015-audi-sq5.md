Common complaints include the high cost of maintenance and repairs, and some concerns about long-term reliability.

**Engine**

**3.0L Supercharged V6**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are sometimes reported, often originating from the thermostat housing or water pump area. Visible coolant pooling under the vehicle, low coolant warning lights, and engine overheating are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty thermostat housing and/or water pump, along with associated seals and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ depending on the shop and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Supercharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger on the 3.0L V6 can experience wear and tear over time, leading to diminished performance. Some owners report hearing unusual noises (whining or rattling) from the supercharger, along with a decrease in power and acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the supercharger. Rebuilding the supercharger may consist of replacing the bearings and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ for replacement; $1,000 - $2,000+ for rebuild, depending on the shop and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Tiptronic Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop is also a reported issue. In some instances, this can be traced to the valve body.
    *   Solution: A software update of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve some shifting issues. If the problem persists, replacing the valve body may be necessary. In severe cases, a full transmission replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for software update; $1,500 - $3,000+ for valve body replacement; $5,000 - $8,000+ for full transmission replacement, depending on the shop and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some SQ5 models are equipped with an optional air suspension system. This system can experience failures over time, leading to a sagging or uneven ride height, a warning light on the dashboard, or a compressor that runs constantly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts, air compressor, or air lines. It's important to diagnose the specific component causing the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut; $800 - $1,500+ for compressor, depending on the shop and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning MMI System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Audi Multi Media Interface (MMI) system can experience a variety of issues, including screen freezing, Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation malfunctions, and unresponsive controls.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve MMI issues. If the problem persists, replacing the MMI control unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for software update; $800 - $2,000+ for control unit replacement, depending on the shop and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or module that is not properly shutting down when the vehicle is turned off.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various electrical components and modules to isolate the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for diagnosis; repair costs vary depending on the faulty component, and can range from $100 to $1000+, depending on the shop and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctions are occasionally reported, including difficulty opening or closing, unusual noises, and leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the sunroof motor, tracks, or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+, depending on the specific issue and parts required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard/Trim Creaks and Rattles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners report experiencing creaks and rattles emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces. These noises can be exacerbated by temperature changes or rough road surfaces.
    *   Solution: Locating and isolating the source of the noise, and then applying felt tape, foam padding, or other sound-dampening materials to the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+, depending on the severity and complexity of the issue. This is often addressed by the owner.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Audi SQ5, while praised for its performance and luxury, can present owners with a range of potential issues. Engine-related concerns such as coolant leaks and supercharger wear are relatively common. Transmission issues are also a possibility, though potentially less severe. Electrical problems, especially with the MMI system and battery drain, can be frustrating. The air suspension (if equipped) is another potential source of costly repairs. While some issues are minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be significant and result in high repair bills. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
