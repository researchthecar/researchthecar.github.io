The 2024 Audi SQ5 is a sporty compact SUV known for its performance and luxurious interior. The SQ5 comes standard with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine producing 349 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While owners appreciate the SQ5's acceleration, handling, and upscale cabin, some common criticisms include its relatively firm ride, less cargo space compared to competitors, and the potential for expensive repairs.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbocharged V6**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled services. This can manifest as a low oil level warning light or the need to top off the oil frequently.
    * Solution: This can sometimes be resolved with an updated PCV valve or software update. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifts, particularly at lower speeds or when downshifting. This can also present as hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    * Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Adaptive Damper Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms:  The adaptive dampers (if equipped) can sometimes fail, leading to a noticeable change in ride quality, increased harshness, and potentially a warning light on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the faulty damper, followed by replacement of the affected unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per damper
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This may affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    * Solution: Try a software update. If that does not work, the infotainment unit might need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, and other driver-assistance systems can experience intermittent malfunctions, generating false alarms or failing to function altogether.
    * Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement. Recalibration may be needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Creaking/Rattling Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported various creaking or rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces, especially on rough roads.
    * Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and applying felt tape, foam padding, or tightening loose fasteners.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Audi SQ5 is a performance SUV with a luxurious interior, but it's not without its potential issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine (excessive oil consumption) and transmission (rough shifting). Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions also appear. Suspension issues can arise with adaptive dampers (if equipped). While the creaking/rattling noises may be irritating, the oil consumption and transmission issues are the most serious and potentially expensive to address. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
