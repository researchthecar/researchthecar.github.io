The 2017 Audi SQ5 is a performance-oriented SUV that blends practicality with sporty driving dynamics. It offers a single engine option: a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 TFSI engine producing 354 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners often praise the SQ5 for its quick acceleration, comfortable interior, and stylish design. Some common criticisms include the infotainment system can be confusing to use, the ride can be harsh on rough roads, and fuel economy is not best-in-class.

**Engine**

**3.0L TFSI Supercharged V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, overheating, "check engine" light. The water pump impeller (often made of plastic) can crack or disintegrate, leading to reduced coolant flow.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump, thermostat, and coolant. Consider upgrading to a metal impeller water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Supercharger Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or rattling noise from the engine, loss of power, particularly at low RPMs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the supercharger clutch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, oil leaks, and a check engine light. The PCV valve can fail, causing vacuum leaks and oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Replace the PCV valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Tiptronic Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between certain gears. Can also feel like a shudder or hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body issues or software issues in the mechatronics unit may be present and need to be addressed or repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $300-$500, valve body repair or replacement $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting unevenly, compressor failure, "suspension fault" warning light. Air springs or air lines can leak.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the leak. Replace the leaking air spring, air line, or compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air spring replacement $800-$1500 per corner, compressor replacement $800-$1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MMI (Multi Media Interface) system freezes, lags, or reboots randomly.
    *   Solution: Perform a software update. If the problem persists, the MMI control unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (dealership dependent, may be free), MMI control unit replacement $800-$2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty readings from various sensors (e.g., parking sensors, tire pressure sensors). Warning lights illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500 per sensor, depending on the sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof not opening or closing properly, getting stuck, or making excessive noise.

**Interior**

*   **Rattles and Squeaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various rattles and squeaks from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: This is often a process of pinpointing the source of the noise and using felt tape or other materials to dampen the vibration.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable depending on the severity and location of the rattle. Can range from DIY fix to $100-$500+ at a shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Audi SQ5 is generally a reliable vehicle. The most common issues revolve around the engine's cooling system (water pump) and the supercharger clutch, which can be costly to repair. Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension (if equipped) and control arm bushings, are also potential concerns. The infotainment system can also have electrical problems. Overall, the SQ5 offers a sporty driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential maintenance costs. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences like rattles to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying significantly.
