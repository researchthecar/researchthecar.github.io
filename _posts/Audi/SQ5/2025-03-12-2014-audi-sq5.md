**Engine**

**3.0L TFSI Supercharged V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump, often the plastic version, can crack or leak, leading to coolant loss, overheating, and potential engine damage. A common symptom is a coolant warning light or visible coolant leak near the front of the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump with an updated version (ideally with a metal impeller) and thermostat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

*   **PCV Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve, integrated into the valve cover, can fail, causing vacuum leaks, rough idling, poor fuel economy, and potentially oil leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover assembly (as the PCV valve is integrated).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Supercharger Coupler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger coupler, a small component within the supercharger, can wear down and fail. This can cause a rattling noise, especially at idle, and a reduction in supercharger boost.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger coupler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit, which controls the transmission's shifting, can experience electronic failures. This can cause erratic shifting, harsh shifting, failure to shift, or getting stuck in a gear. Diagnostic trouble codes related to the Mechatronic unit will be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the Mechatronic unit. In some cases, a software update may resolve the issue, but often replacement is necessary.
