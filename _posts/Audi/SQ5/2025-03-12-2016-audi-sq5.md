The 2016 Audi SQ5 is a performance-oriented compact SUV known for its powerful supercharged V6 engine, sporty handling, and luxurious interior. It came standard with a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 engine producing 354 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission.
