This response will focus on issues reported for the standard 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbocharged V6**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks may be detected under the vehicle, or coolant level in the reservoir may be noticeably low. Overheating may occur if the leak is severe. This issue is sometimes related to a faulty thermostat housing or water pump.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty component (thermostat housing or water pump) and coolant flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the engine, often observed around the valve cover gaskets or oil pan gasket. Burning smell may be present as oil drips onto hot engine components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during cold starts.
    *   Solution: Software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) or, in more severe cases, replacement of valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (reflash) - $2000+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delay between selecting drive or reverse and the transmission engaging.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid level check and top-off; in persistent cases, diagnostics to check for internal transmission wear or damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid check/top-off) - $4000+ (transmission rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle is equipped with air suspension, issues may arise such as the vehicle sagging on one side, failure to raise or lower, or error messages on the dashboard related to the suspension system. This can be due to leaks in the air struts or a faulty air compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air strut(s) or the faulty air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per strut; $600 - $1500+ for the compressor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software update or, in severe cases, replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update if under warranty) - $1500+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with various sensors, such as parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, or adaptive cruise control, leading to error messages or system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to the vehicle failing to start.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to find parasitic draw, often related to a faulty module not properly shutting down when the vehicle is turned off. Replacement of the battery and parasitic draw.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per component
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof fails to open or close properly, or makes excessive noise during operation. Leaks can also occur.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of sunroof tracks, adjustment of the sunroof mechanism, or replacement of faulty components such as the motor or seals.
