    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting, especially at low speeds. Hesitation during acceleration can also occur.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can resolve the issue. In other cases, replacing the mechatronic unit or even the entire transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $7000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the nature of dual clutch transmissions, some owners have reported excessive clutch wear which causes delayed or rough shifts.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement or transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $8000+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The A6 allroad features an adaptive air suspension system. Problems can arise with the air struts, air compressor, or air lines, leading to a sagging vehicle, uneven ride height, or failure of the suspension to adjust. Warning lights on the dashboard will typically illuminate.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves inspecting the air suspension components for leaks or damage. Replacing the faulty air strut, compressor, or air line is the typical repair.
