*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine misfires, particularly under heavy acceleration or when the engine is cold. This can manifest as a rough idle, hesitation, and a noticeable loss of power. In some instances, the check engine light may illuminate. The misfires can be attributed to faulty ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils. A diagnostic scan should be performed to identify the specific cylinder(s) experiencing the misfire.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

**Transmission**

**Seven-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have described experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds or during gear changes in stop-and-go traffic. This can be caused by the dual-clutch transmission not engaging smoothly.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. However, if the problem persists, it could indicate a more serious issue with the clutch packs or mechatronic unit within the transmission.

    *   Description/Symptoms: The A6 allroad comes with an adaptive air suspension. Some owners have reported experiencing air suspension leaks, leading to the vehicle sagging on one or more corners, especially when parked overnight. This can be due to faulty air struts, air lines, or the air compressor.
    *   Solution: Identifying and replacing the leaking components. This may involve replacing the air strut(s), repairing or replacing air lines, or replacing the air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut; $200 - $500+ for air lines; $500 - $1,500+ for air compressor.
