**Introduction**

The 2019 Audi Q2 Quattro is a subcompact luxury SUV that offers a sporty and upscale driving experience. It is equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four engine that generates 188 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. The Q2 Quattro comes standard with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (DCT) and all-wheel drive. Drivers appreciate the Q2 Quattro's agile handling, comfortable interior, and advanced technology features. However, some owners have reported various issues with the vehicle.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-Four**

* **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves:** Description/Symptoms: As the engine runs, carbon deposits from the exhaust gas can accumulate on the intake valves, restricting airflow and reducing engine performance. Symptoms include rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and decreased fuel efficiency. Solution: The intake valves must be cleaned manually by a qualified mechanic. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner maintains the tension of the timing chain, which synchronizes the camshafts and crankshaft. A faulty tensioner can cause the timing chain to skip or break, leading to catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include rattling noises from the engine or sudden loss of power. Solution: The timing chain tensioner needs to be replaced along with the timing chain and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
* **Oil Leaks from Turbocharger:** Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger is a device that boosts engine power by increasing the air pressure. Oil leaks from the turbocharger can cause smoking from the engine, low oil levels, and turbocharger failure. Solution: Replace the turbocharger oil seals or turbocharger unit. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

**Transmission**

**Seven-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic (DCT)**

* **Hesitation and Jerking:** Description/Symptoms: The DCT may hesitate or jerk during shifting, especially during low-speed maneuvers. Solution: Update the transmission software or replace the clutch packs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Loss of Drive:** Description/Symptoms: The transmission may lose drive suddenly, preventing the vehicle from moving. Solution: Replace the mechatronic unit or transmission control module. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** Description/Symptoms: The transmission may develop leaks from seals or gaskets, causing low fluid levels and transmission damage. Solution: Replace the leaking components and refill the transmission fluid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure:** Description/Symptoms: The lower control arm bushings in the front suspension can fail prematurely, causing knocking or clunking noises, vibration, and poor handling. Solution: Replace the lower control arm bushings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Rear Suspension Coil Spring Fracture:** Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension coil springs can fracture, causing a significant drop in ride height and poor handling. Solution: Replace the fractured coil springs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Excessive Body Roll:** Description/Symptoms: The Q2 Quattro may exhibit excessive body roll during cornering, reducing stability and handling. Solution: Upgrade the suspension with stiffer springs or aftermarket sway bars. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may experience battery drain over time, especially when parked for extended periods. Solution: Identify and fix the source of the electrical drain, such as faulty modules or components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
* **Malfunctioning Dashboard Lights:** Description/Symptoms: The instrument panel lights may malfunction, including the speedometer, tachometer, or other gauges. Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the faulty lighting components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Leaks:** Description/Symptoms: The Q2 Quattro's panoramic sunroof may leak during heavy rain or car washes. Solution: Replace the sunroof seals or adjust the sunroof mechanism. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Faulty Door Latches:** Description/Symptoms: The door latches may fail to engage or release properly, preventing the doors from opening or closing securely. Solution: Replace the faulty door latches. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunctions:** Description/Symptoms: The Q2 Quattro's climate control system may malfunction, resulting in inconsistent temperatures, poor airflow, or failure to control the temperature. Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the faulty components, such as the climate control module or actuators. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Infotainment System Glitches:** Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may experience glitches or crashes, affecting navigation, audio, or other functions. Solution: Update the software or replace the infotainment unit. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+

**Summary:**

The 2019 Audi Q2 Quattro has received positive reviews for its performance, interior, and technology. However, owners have reported various issues that can be costly to repair. The most severe and expensive issues include engine problems such as timing chain tensioner failure and turbocharger oil leaks. Transmission problems, such as loss of drive and hesitation, can also be significant and impact the vehicle's drivability. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can require major repairs that can affect the vehicle's overall reliability.
