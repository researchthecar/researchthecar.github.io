Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Audi Q2 Quattro, formatted for your website. The 2019 Audi Q2 is a subcompact luxury SUV that offers a blend of style, practicality, and a sporty driving experience. While it wasn't sold in the US, it was popular in Europe and other markets. It is available with several engine options including the 1.4L TFSI, 2.0L TFSI, and various diesel engines. For this report, we will focus on the 2.0L TFSI petrol engine. The 2.0L TFSI engine produces around 190 horsepower and 320 Nm of torque. Generally, owners appreciate the Q2's stylish design, compact size making it easy to maneuver in urban environments, and its high-quality interior. Some common dislikes include the relatively firm ride, especially with larger wheels, and the higher price point compared to some non-luxury competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L TFSI**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption. This can manifest as needing to top up the oil more frequently than the service intervals suggest, or seeing the low oil level warning light illuminate.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks are essential. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection is recommended. This may involve an oil consumption test to determine the rate and potential causes, such as piston ring issues or valve stem seal leaks. In severe cases, engine component replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines, like the 2.0L TFSI, can be prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves. This is because fuel is injected directly into the cylinder, bypassing the intake valves, which prevents the fuel from cleaning them. Symptoms include rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, decreased fuel economy, and potentially misfires.
    *   Solution: A carbon cleaning service is typically required. This involves manually cleaning the intake valves using specialized tools and solvents, or using a media blasting technique.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S Tronic (DSG) Automatic**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit is the brain of the DSG transmission, controlling the hydraulic actuators that shift gears. Failure can lead to erratic shifting, harsh gear changes, inability to shift, or complete transmission failure. Warning lights on the dashboard may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the Mechatronic unit. In some cases, reprogramming the unit may resolve the issue, but physical damage usually necessitates replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dual-clutch transmissions like the S Tronic rely on clutches to engage and disengage gears. Over time, these clutches can wear out, especially with aggressive driving or frequent stop-and-go traffic. Symptoms include slipping, shuddering during gear changes, and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is the only solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Audi infotainment system can experience glitches such as freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Initially, try restarting the system. A software update from the dealer may also resolve the issues. In some cases, hardware replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1000+ (hardware replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors, particularly, can fail. This is indicated by error messages or the sensors not functioning correctly (false positives/negatives).
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **LED Lighting Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the LED headlights or taillights, such as flickering or premature failure. This can be due to faulty LED modules or wiring problems.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a technician to determine the root cause of the lighting issue, followed by replacement of the affected LED module, wiring repair, or headlight/taillight assembly replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1000+ depending on the specific issue and parts needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems such as sticking, failing to open or close properly, or excessive wind noise.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the sunroof mechanism, cleaning and lubrication of moving parts, or replacement of faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Audi Q2 Quattro, while a stylish and desirable subcompact SUV, can experience a range of issues. The 2.0L TFSI engine is susceptible to oil consumption and carbon buildup, which can lead to performance issues and costly repairs. The S Tronic transmission can suffer from Mechatronic unit failures and clutch wear, adding to the potential maintenance expenses. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and sensors, are also prevalent. While most of the issues aren't safety-critical, they can be inconvenient and expensive to fix. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, including budgeting for potential maintenance costs.
