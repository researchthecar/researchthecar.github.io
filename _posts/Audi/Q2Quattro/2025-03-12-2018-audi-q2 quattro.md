The 2018 Audi Q2 Quattro is a subcompact luxury crossover known for its stylish design, agile handling, and premium interior. Engine options for the 2018 Q2 vary depending on the market, but a common configuration includes a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 190 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. Owners generally appreciate the Q2's fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and advanced technology features. Some common complaints include limited rear passenger space and a relatively firm suspension, particularly on models with larger wheels.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to frequently add oil between scheduled oil changes, a low oil level warning light, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The problem may be caused by worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the issue. Replacing the affected components (piston rings, valve stem seals, or even the entire engine in severe cases) is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.

**Transmission**

**7-Speed S tronic Dual-Clutch Transmission**
*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit (the transmission control unit) can fail, leading to erratic shifting, harsh engagement, transmission slipping, inability to shift, and potential loss of drive. Warning lights on the dashboard may also illuminate.
    *   Solution: The faulty mechatronic unit needs to be replaced or repaired. Replacement is the more common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dual-clutch transmission can experience premature clutch wear, particularly with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping during acceleration, jerky shifts, shuddering, and difficulty engaging gears.

    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealer can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the MMI control unit may need to be replaced.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the source and complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Audi Q2 Quattro, while generally a reliable and desirable vehicle, can experience some common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine's oil consumption and the transmission's mechatronic unit and clutch wear, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions are also relatively common. Water leaks and interior noises, while less critical, can be annoying. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and thoroughly inspect any used Q2 before purchasing.
