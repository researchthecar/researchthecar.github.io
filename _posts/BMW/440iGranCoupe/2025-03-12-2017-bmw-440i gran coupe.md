The 2017 BMW 440i Gran Coupe is a sleek and sporty four-door coupe that offers a blend of performance and practicality. The standard engine is a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six (B58) producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2017 4 Series Gran Coupe include the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four (B48) found in the 430i models. Both engines can be paired with either an 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual (availability may vary depending on model year and configuration). Owners often praise the 440i's powerful engine, stylish design, and comfortable ride. Criticisms sometimes include the tight rear seating and higher maintenance costs associated with BMW ownership.

**Summary**

The 2017 BMW 440i Gran Coupe, while generally reliable, exhibits some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The B58 engine can be prone to oil leaks, requiring gasket replacements, while the ZF 8-speed automatic transmission sometimes suffers from rough shifting, potentially needing fluid changes, valve body work, or even a rebuild in more severe cases. Electrically, window regulators and the iDrive system can experience failures. Interior creaking is also a common complaint. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the issue, but BMW parts and labor can be expensive, so it is always good to get a pre-purchase inspection by a mechanic familiar with BMWs. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs.
