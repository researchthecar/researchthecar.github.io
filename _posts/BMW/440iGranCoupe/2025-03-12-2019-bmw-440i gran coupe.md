The 2019 BMW 440i Gran Coupe is a stylish and sporty four-door coupe offering a blend of practicality and performance. It came standard with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine (B58) producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. The 440i was available with either an 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission (though manual availability was very limited). Owners generally praise the 440i Gran Coupe for its sleek design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving dynamics. Some common dislikes include the relatively cramped rear seating, the higher price point compared to some competitors, and potential for expensive maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points in the cooling system, including the radiator, hoses, water pump, and expansion tank. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles. The B58 engine is generally less prone to coolant leaks than the earlier N55 engine, but leaks can still happen over time.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or delayed shifting, particularly during upshifts or downshifts at lower speeds. This may be more noticeable after the transmission fluid warms up.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Humming noises, shuddering or vibrations at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration, may indicate an issue with the torque converter.

*   **Adaptive Damper Malfunctions (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle is equipped with adaptive dampers (adjustable suspension), these can sometimes fail, leading to a noticeably harsher or bouncier ride. Warning lights on the dashboard may also illuminate.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify the faulty damper, followed by damper replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per damper

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine.

    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific issue, followed by repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, tracks, or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+

**Summary**

The 2019 BMW 440i Gran Coupe is generally a reliable vehicle, but it is not without its potential issues. Common problems include oil leaks, coolant leaks, transmission issues (especially with the automatic), electrical glitches, and sunroof malfunctions. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but some repairs, such as transmission rebuilds or control module replacements, can be quite expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase. Addressing these issues may come at a higher cost than some other vehicle brands.
