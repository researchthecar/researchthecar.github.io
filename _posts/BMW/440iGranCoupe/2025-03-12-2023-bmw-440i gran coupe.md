The 2023 BMW 440i Gran Coupe is a stylish and sporty four-door coupe that offers a blend of performance and practicality. The most popular engine in this configuration is the B58 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six, producing 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include the B48 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four found in the 430i, producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission available is an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the 440i Gran Coupe for its powerful engine, agile handling, and luxurious interior. Some common dislikes include the firm ride quality (especially with the M Sport suspension), the somewhat limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline, and the complexity of the iDrive infotainment system, but the B58 makes up for these issues.

**Summary**

The 2023 BMW 440i Gran Coupe, while generally reliable, can experience a few common issues. Engine issues such as coolant and oil leaks are common and can range in cost. Transmission issues involving the 8-speed automatic can be costly if a full rebuild is needed. Electrical glitches with the iDrive system and sensor malfunctions are also possible. The B58 engine option is generally considered to be more reliable than the B48, however the inline-six engine still has its issues. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, especially if considering a used model with higher mileage.
