### Summary Verdict
The 2014 BMW 750Li is a luxurious and powerful vehicle, but its advanced technology and high-performance engine can lead to specific reliability concerns as it ages. The 4.4L twin-turbo V8 is prone to oil leaks, fuel injector issues, and valve stem seal wear, which can be costly to repair. The 8-speed automatic transmission, while generally robust, can experience problems with the mechatronic unit and torque converter. The sophisticated suspension system, particularly the adaptive features, may require attention due to potential failures in active components and air suspension parts. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with the powertrain and advanced systems.
