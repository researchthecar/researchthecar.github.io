The 2017 BMW 750Li is a flagship luxury sedan, offering a blend of performance and comfort. Powered by a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 445 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque, the 750Li delivers strong acceleration and a refined driving experience. Other engine options available for the 2017 7 Series include a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (740i) and a 6.6-liter turbocharged V12 (760Li). A hybrid powertrain (740e xDrive iPerformance) was also available. The vehicle is generally praised for its luxurious interior, advanced technology features, and smooth ride. However, owners have reported issues with reliability, particularly concerning the electrical system and complex technology. Some dislike the high maintenance costs associated with the car. All engine options are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, oil filter housing gasket, and turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals. For turbocharger oil lines, replacement of the lines may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from various sources such as the expansion tank, radiator, or coolant hoses. You may smell coolant or see puddles under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking parts and flush and refill the cooling system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the specific part that needs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8HP75)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough shifting, hesitation, or jerking during gear changes, especially at lower speeds. This can be caused by issues with the valve body, solenoids, or low transmission fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, perform a fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, a valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 750Li features an air suspension system that can experience malfunctions, leading to a sagging suspension, uneven ride height, or "Suspension Control System Malfunction" warning lights. This may be due to faulty air struts, air compressor, or air lines.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component causing the issue. Replace faulty air struts, air compressor, or repair/replace damaged air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ per strut depending on the specific component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or unresponsive behavior. This may be due to software bugs or hardware issues.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. If the issue persists, a software update or replacement of the iDrive control unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $1,500+ (iDrive control unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various sensors around the vehicle can fail causing warning lights or malfunctions. Common sensor failures include the blind spot monitoring sensors, parking sensors, and TPMS sensors.
    * Solution: Scan the vehicle to identify the failed sensor and replace it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the car's battery draining prematurely. This can be due to parasitic draws, where electrical components continue to draw power even when the car is off.
    * Solution: Diagnose and identify the source of the parasitic draw. Repair or replace the faulty component causing the drain.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain. Replacing the battery is usually around $300-500.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Summary:**

The 2017 BMW 750Li offers a luxurious driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the engine (oil leaks, coolant leaks), transmission (rough shifting), suspension (air suspension malfunctions), and electrical systems (iDrive, sensor failures, battery drain). Repairs can be costly, especially for the air suspension and complex electronics. Severity ranges from minor annoyances to potentially serious mechanical failures. Addressing these issues proactively can help maintain the vehicle's performance and value.
