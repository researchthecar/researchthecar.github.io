The 2016 BMW 750Li is a luxury sedan known for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. It offers a blend of performance and opulence that appeals to discerning drivers. The 750Li comes standard with a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 445 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2016 7 Series included a 3.0-liter inline-6 cylinder engine (740i/Li) and a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine paired with an electric motor (740e/Le xDrive iPerformance). All models are equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the 750Li's smooth power delivery, luxurious interior, and abundance of features. Common dislikes include the complex electronics, potential for expensive repairs, and somewhat numb steering feel compared to older BMWs.
