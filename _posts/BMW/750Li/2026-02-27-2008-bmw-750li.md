### Summary Verdict
The 2008 BMW 750Li is a luxurious and powerful vehicle, but its advanced technology and complex systems can lead to specific reliability concerns. The engine's V8 is generally robust, but common issues include valve stem seal wear, leading to oil consumption and blue smoke, and potential cooling system leaks. The automatic transmission, while smooth, can experience problems with the mechatronic unit or torque converter. The sophisticated suspension, particularly the Adaptive Drive and air suspension components, can be costly to repair if they fail. Electrical gremlins, especially within the iDrive infotainment system and door lock actuators, are also noted. While exterior and interior components are generally well-built, owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with the more complex systems.
