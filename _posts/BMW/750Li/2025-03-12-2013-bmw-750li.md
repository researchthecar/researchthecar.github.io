    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a fairly common issue on the N63TU engine, often stemming from the valve cover gaskets, oil filter housing gasket, and turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and lines is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur in various locations, including the water pump, thermostat housing, and radiator hoses. Symptoms include a low coolant warning, visible coolant leaks, and overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty component is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VANOS (Variable Valve Timing) system can experience failures, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and potentially a check engine light.
