**Engine**

**4.4L TwinPower Turbo V8 (N63TU)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, particularly from valve cover gaskets and the turbocharger oil supply lines. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil level warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or lines. Retorquing of leaking bolts may solve the problem temporarily.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are frequent, stemming from the coolant transfer pipe (the "valley pan") located underneath the intake manifold, as well as from the plastic thermostat housing. Visible coolant loss, overheating, and the low coolant warning light will alert the driver.
    *   Solution: Replacing the coolant transfer pipe (valley pan), thermostat housing, and any other brittle plastic cooling components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: High-Pressure Fuel Injectors can fail prematurely leading to rough idling, misfires, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors. Replacing all injectors at once may be advisable due to similar age and wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per injector (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The twin-turbochargers on the N63 can experience issues such as oil leaks and failing wastegates. This can result in reduced power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and turbocharger failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the turbochargers and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $6000+ depending on whether one or both turbos need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ZF 8HP transmission can experience issues with the valve body, leading to harsh shifting, slipping, or failure to shift. These issues can be related to mechatronic sealing sleeves/adaptors, internal solenoids, and general wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky shifting, delayed engagement, or complete loss of gear engagement.
    *   Solution: Replace the Mechatronic Unit or the transmission itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $8000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 750Li features air suspension, which can experience problems such as leaks in the air springs, a failing compressor, or issues with the ride height sensors. Symptoms include the car sitting unevenly, a bumpy ride, or suspension malfunction warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air springs, compressor, or ride height sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ per corner, depending on the affected component. Compressor replacement is usually around $800 - $1500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain is a common complaint, often attributed to faulty modules not shutting down properly. This can lead to a dead battery and difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the drain (often requires specialized diagnostic equipment) and replacing the faulty module or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the component causing the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system can experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Software updates or replacement of the iDrive control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
