The 2020 BMW 230i xDrive is a sporty and compact coupe known for its engaging driving dynamics and premium features. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A major appeal is its agile handling and quick acceleration. However, some owners have noted a firm ride and limited rear passenger space. Other engine options include the M235i xDriveâ€™s more powerful 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6, and all engine options are exclusively paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some like the stylish design and refined interior, while others dislike the higher price point compared to competitors and potential reliability concerns.
