**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (B48)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report unusually high oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. The low oil level warning light may illuminate prematurely.
    *   Solution: Check for any leaks. A dealer may perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of oil consumption. If deemed excessive, potential solutions include replacing the piston rings or, in more severe cases, replacing the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation when shifting between gears has also been reported.
    *   Solution: Initially, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may be attempted. If the problem persists, the valve body or mechatronic unit within the transmission may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a restart. This may affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update to the iDrive system is often the first step. If the problem persists, replacement of the iDrive control unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+

*   **Automatic High Beam Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic high beam system may fail to activate or deactivate properly, leading to unsafe driving conditions. It may also flash intermittently or fail to dim when oncoming traffic is detected.
    *   Solution: A software update to the headlight control module may resolve the issue. If not, the headlight assembly or associated sensors may need replacement.

    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and tightening or replacing the affected components or clips. Applying felt tape or other noise dampening materials may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 BMW 230i xDrive presents a mix of potential issues. The engine's oil consumption can be a notable concern with potentially high repair costs, while the transmission might exhibit shifting problems addressable through software updates or more involved repairs.
