The 2014 BMW 535i is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a blend of performance, comfort, and technology. It's generally praised for its agile handling, smooth ride, and luxurious interior. However, like all vehicles, it has its share of potential issues. The 535i comes standard with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (N55) producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2014 5 Series included a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 (528i), a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 (550i), and a diesel 3.0-liter inline-6 (535d). The standard transmission is an 8-speed automatic, though some earlier models may have been available with a 6-speed manual. Some common dislikes include the high cost of maintenance and repairs, complex electronics that can be prone to failure, and a somewhat firm ride on models with the sport suspension.
