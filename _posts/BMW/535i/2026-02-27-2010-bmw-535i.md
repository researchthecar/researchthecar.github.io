### Summary Verdict
The 2010 BMW 535i (E60) is a capable luxury sedan, but its advanced technology and performance-oriented nature mean potential owners should be prepared for specific reliability concerns. The N54 and N55 engines, while powerful, are prone to issues like fuel injector failure, turbocharger problems, and PCV valve issues, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission can also experience mechatronic unit or torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system and lighting, are not uncommon.
