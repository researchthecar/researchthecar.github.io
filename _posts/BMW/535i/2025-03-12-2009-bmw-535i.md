The 2009 BMW 535i is part of the E60 5-Series generation, known for its blend of luxury and performance. This model year offers a compelling driving experience but also comes with some known issues. The 535i primarily features a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six engine (N54) producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. An automatic and a manual transmission were both available. People generally appreciate the 535i for its responsive engine, sporty handling, and comfortable interior. However, common complaints revolve around the car's reliability, particularly with its engine components and electrical systems, which can lead to expensive repairs.
