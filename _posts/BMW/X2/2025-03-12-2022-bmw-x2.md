The 2022 BMW X2 is a subcompact luxury SUV known for its sporty handling and distinctive styling. The base model, the X2 sDrive28i, is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The X2 M35i boasts a more powerful version of the same engine, delivering 302 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the X2 for its nimble driving dynamics, comfortable front seats, and user-friendly technology. However, some criticize its limited rear passenger space, firm ride, and relatively small cargo area.
