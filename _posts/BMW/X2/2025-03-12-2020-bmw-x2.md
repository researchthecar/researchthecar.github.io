The 2020 BMW X2 is a sporty and stylish subcompact SUV that offers a blend of performance and practicality. It was offered with two primary engine options: the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque and the M35i variant, featuring a more potent version of the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, generating 302 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The X2 is generally liked for its agile handling, distinctive design, and user-friendly technology. However, some common dislikes include its firm ride, limited rear passenger space, and relatively small cargo area.
