The 2019 BMW X2 is a subcompact luxury crossover known for its sporty handling, distinctive styling, and premium interior. Engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (228 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque) and a more potent version of the same engine (302 hp and 332 lb-ft of torque) in the M35i model. Both engines are typically paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the X2's agile driving dynamics and unique design, but some criticize its limited rear passenger space and firm ride.
