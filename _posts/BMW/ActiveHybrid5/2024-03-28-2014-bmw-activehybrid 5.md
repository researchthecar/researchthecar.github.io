* **Valve cover gasket leak:** The valve cover gasket may leak oil, causing smoke from the engine bay and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a burning oil smell, excessive oil consumption, and oil dripping from the engine. **Solution:** Replace the valve cover gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**Eight-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip or hesitate when shifting gears due to worn or malfunctioning clutches or torque converter issues. Symptoms include difficulty accelerating, delayed gear shifts, and shuddering or vibration during shifting. **Solution:** Repair or replace the transmission or affected components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,500 - $5,000+
* **Mechatronic unit failure:** The mechatronic unit, which controls the transmission's hydraulic and electronic functions, may fail due to electrical or mechanical issues. Symptoms include transmission shifting problems, loss of power, and check engine light illumination. **Solution:** Replace the mechatronic unit. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,000 - $3,000+
* **Driveline vibration:** The driveline, which connects the transmission to the wheels, may vibrate due to worn or damaged components such as CV joints or driveshafts. Symptoms include a noticeable vibration or shudder when accelerating or driving at higher speeds. **Solution:** Inspect and replace the affected components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+
