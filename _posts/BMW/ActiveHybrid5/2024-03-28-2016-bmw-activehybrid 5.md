**Summary**

While the 2016 BMW ActiveHybrid 5 offers a blend of performance and efficiency, it's not without its fair share of issues. The most significant and costly problems are related to the engine (turbo wastegate actuator failure, high-pressure fuel pump failure) and transmission (shift solenoid malfunction). Other common issues, such as suspension bushing wear, electrical malfunctions, and exterior condensation, are generally less severe and expensive to repair. Overall, the reliability of this vehicle is moderate, and maintenance costs can be high due to the complexity of its hybrid system.
