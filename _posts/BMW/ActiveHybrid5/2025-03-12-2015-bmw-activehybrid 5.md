The 2015 BMW ActiveHybrid 5 is a luxury sedan that combines a gasoline engine with an electric motor to achieve improved fuel economy and performance. The ActiveHybrid 5 features a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 335 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. The conventional engine option for the 2015 BMW 5 Series included a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4, a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 (without the hybrid system), and a turbocharged 4.4-liter V8. All engine options were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the ActiveHybrid 5's blend of performance and efficiency, as well as its luxurious interior and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include the added complexity and potential maintenance costs associated with the hybrid system, as well as a slightly smaller trunk space due to the battery pack.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**
*   **Reduced Electric Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a noticeable decrease in the electric-only driving range over time. The battery's capacity degrades, leading to shorter distances on electric power alone.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hybrid battery pack is the primary solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+

**Engine**

**N55 3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6 (Hybrid)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, particularly from the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the vehicle, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gasket ($300 - $600), oil filter housing gasket ($400 - $800), oil pan gasket ($800 - $1500+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various locations, including the water pump, radiator hoses, and expansion tank. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking component is the necessary fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Water pump ($600 - $1200), radiator hoses ($200 - $500), expansion tank ($200 - $400)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning VANOS (Variable Valve Timing) solenoids can cause rough idling, decreased performance, and error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty VANOS solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush and filter change ($300 - $500), valve body replacement ($1500 - $3000), transmission rebuild ($4000+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Malfunctions (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle is equipped with adaptive dampers (Dynamic Damper Control), these can sometimes fail, leading to a harsh or uneven ride. Error messages related to the suspension system may also appear.

**Summary**

The 2015 BMW ActiveHybrid 5 presents a mix of potential issues that buyers should be aware of. Engine oil leaks and cooling system issues are common, and the hybrid system adds complexity with potential battery degradation. Electrical problems and transmission issues can also arise. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (e.g., VANOS solenoid replacement) to more significant (e.g., hybrid battery replacement). Repair costs can also vary widely depending on the problem, with some repairs potentially costing several thousand dollars. Buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
