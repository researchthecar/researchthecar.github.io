The 2016 BMW ActiveHybrid 5 is a luxury sedan that combines a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline engine with an electric motor and an eight-speed automatic transmission. The combined output is 302 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. What owners like most about the car is its smooth and comfortable ride, fuel efficiency, and luxurious interior. What they dislike is the small trunk space due to the hybrid battery pack, the added complexity of the hybrid system that can lead to potentially expensive repairs, and the feeling that the regenerative braking is not smooth.
