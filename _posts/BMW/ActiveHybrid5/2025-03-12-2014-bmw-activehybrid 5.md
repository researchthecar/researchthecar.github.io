The 2014 BMW ActiveHybrid 5 is a luxury sedan that combines a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine with an electric motor and a lithium-ion battery pack. The powertrain delivers a combined output of 335 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2014 BMW 5 Series (non-hybrid) include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, a more powerful version of the 3.0-liter inline-six, and a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8. All engines were typically paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the ActiveHybrid 5 for its fuel efficiency and smooth ride, but some have expressed concerns about the complexity of the hybrid system and potential maintenance costs. Some dislikes include the reduced trunk space due to the battery pack.
