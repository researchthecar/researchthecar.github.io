### Summary Verdict
The 2011 BMW 335is is a performance car that demands attention to its specific high-performance components. The N54 engine, while powerful, is known for potential issues with fuel injectors, wastegates, and the cooling system, which can be costly to repair. The M-DCT transmission, though offering rapid shifts, can also present expensive problems like mechatronics unit failure. The manual transmission is generally more reliable. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system and headlight ballasts, are also noted. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the driving experience and overall performance justify the maintenance investment. Regular and proactive maintenance is crucial for mitigating these risks.
