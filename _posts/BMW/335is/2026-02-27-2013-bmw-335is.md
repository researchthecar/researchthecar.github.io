### Summary Verdict
The 2013 BMW 335is is a capable performance coupe with a generally strong reliability record for its class. The N54 engine, while powerful, has known potential issues such as wastegate rattle, fuel injector problems, and electric water pump failures, which can be costly to repair. The M-DCT transmission, though offering rapid shifts, can also present expensive issues like mechatronics unit failure. The manual transmission is typically more straightforward. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system, can occur. However, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the 335is can remain a rewarding and reliable performance vehicle.
