The 2013 BMW 335is is a performance-oriented coupe or convertible within the E92/E93 3-Series generation. It's powered exclusively by the N54 twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, producing 320 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque (with an overboost function temporarily increasing torque to 370 lb-ft). Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed DCT (Dual Clutch Transmission). Owners generally praise the car for its engaging driving dynamics, powerful engine, and distinctive styling. Common complaints often revolve around higher maintenance costs compared to non-performance BMW models, and the age-related wear and tear that comes with owning a used vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2013 BMW 335is, while a desirable performance car, can present owners with a range of potential issues. Engine-related problems, particularly those associated with the N54 engine's HPFP, turbochargers, and oil leaks, are common and can be costly to address. DCT transmission issues, suspension wear, and electrical problems also contribute to the overall maintenance burden. While some issues are relatively minor, others can require significant investment to repair, making it crucial for potential buyers to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified BMW mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
