### Summary Verdict
The 2012 BMW 335is is a capable performance coupe with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The potent N54 engine, while delivering exhilarating performance, is prone to specific issues like fuel injector failures, water pump/thermostat problems, and wastegate rattle, which are relatively common for this engine variant. The M-DCT transmission can also present costly issues with its mechatronics unit and clutch packs. However, the manual transmission and other systems like suspension, exterior, and interior components tend to be reliable, with electrical gremlins like iDrive glitches being the most frequent non-mechanical concern. Regular maintenance and addressing these known issues proactively are key to maintaining the 335is's performance and longevity.
