The 2012 BMW 335is is a high-performance variant of the E92 3 Series coupe, known for its enhanced power and sporty driving dynamics. It came equipped with the N54 twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, producing 320 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. An overboost function temporarily increased torque to 370 lb-ft. This engine was available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praise the 335is for its powerful engine, sharp handling, and distinctive styling. Common complaints include the cost of maintenance, the complexity of the turbocharged engine, and the potential for electrical issues.

**Engine**

**N54 Twin-Turbocharged 3.0L Inline-Six**

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Long cranking times, rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, and a possible check engine light. The car may stall unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP. Often upgraded to a newer revision.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, fuel smell, reduced performance, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty injectors. It is often recommended to replace all injectors at once to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per injector. (Considerably higher if all 6 are replaced.)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wastegate Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling or buzzing noise, especially noticeable during acceleration or deceleration. This is caused by worn wastegate bushings within the turbochargers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbochargers or rebuild them with aftermarket wastegate flappers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+ (Turbocharger replacement is costly. Aftermarket solutions can be cheaper but require more labor.)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, low oil level warnings. Common leak points include the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, and oil pan gasket.
