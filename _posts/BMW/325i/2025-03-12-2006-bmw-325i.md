The 2006 BMW 325i is a generally well-regarded car with a focus on driving experience. However, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to oil leaks, the VANOS system, and suspension components. Electrical issues, such as battery drains and window regulator failures, can also occur. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the issue and the shop performing the work, but generally, BMW maintenance can be more expensive than that of other brands. Buyers should inspect the car thoroughly, check service records, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
