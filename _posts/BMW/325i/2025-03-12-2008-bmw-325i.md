The 2008 BMW 325i is a popular entry-level luxury car known for its sporty handling, refined interior, and overall driving experience. The 325i came standard with a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (N52B30), producing 215 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2008 BMW 3 Series included the 328i (with a slightly more powerful version of the same N52 engine), the 335i (with a turbocharged inline-6), and diesel engines in some markets. Transmission choices were typically a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 325i for its balanced performance, engaging driving dynamics, and classic BMW styling. Common dislikes include higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles and some reported reliability concerns, particularly with certain engine components and electrical systems.
