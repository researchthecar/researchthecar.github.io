The 2011 BMW 325i, part of the E90/E91/E92/E93 generation, is known for its engaging driving dynamics and premium feel. While the 325i specifically was not sold in the North American market, it is essentially the same as the 328i sold in North America. The 2011 328i is powered by a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (N52B30) producing 230 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the car for its responsive handling, smooth engine, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include higher maintenance costs compared to other brands, and some reported issues with electrical components and certain engine parts.
