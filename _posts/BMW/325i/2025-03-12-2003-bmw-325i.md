The 2003 BMW 325i is a popular choice from the E46 generation, known for its engaging driving dynamics and classic BMW styling. The 325i came standard with a 2.5-liter inline-6 engine (M54B25) producing 184 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2003 E46 lineup include the smaller 320i, the higher-performance 330i, and the 330Ci convertible. Transmission options for the 325i include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners typically appreciate the car's balanced handling, comfortable ride, and relatively simple mechanics compared to later BMW models. Common complaints revolve around the age of the vehicle, leading to increased maintenance demands and potential failures of aging components, as well as some specific issues common to this model.

**Summary**

The 2003 BMW 325i is a generally reliable vehicle but given its age, it is subject to a variety of common issues. Engine problems such as oil leaks and cooling system failures are frequent, and can be relatively expensive to repair. The transmission can suffer from valve body or torque converter issues, especially in the automatic versions, potentially leading to high repair costs. Suspension issues like control arm bushing and strut failures are also common.  Electrical gremlins such as window regulator and instrument cluster problems are other areas to inspect. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in areas prone to corrosion. The average cost to maintain these vehicles can be high, especially as they age, requiring proactive maintenance and careful inspection before purchase. While the driving experience is typically praised, potential buyers should factor in these repair and maintenance costs.
