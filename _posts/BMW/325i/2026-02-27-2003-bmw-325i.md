### Summary Verdict
The 2003 BMW 325i (E46) is a desirable car, but its age means certain components are prone to failure. Common issues revolve around oil leaks from the engine, cooling system components, and the PCV system. Automatic transmissions can develop leaks or torque converter problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shock mounts are also wear items. Electrically, ABS/DSC modules, window regulators, and instrument clusters are known to fail.
