### Summary Verdict
The 2011 BMW 325i (E90) is a capable and enjoyable luxury sedan. While its core mechanical components, particularly the inline-6 engine and transmissions, are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil leaks from the valve cover and oil pan gaskets, and PCV system failures. The electric water pump is another component that may require attention. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, though not rampant, can manifest as iDrive system glitches. Proactive maintenance, especially addressing oil leaks and monitoring the cooling system, can mitigate many of these potential problems and ensure a reliable ownership experience.
