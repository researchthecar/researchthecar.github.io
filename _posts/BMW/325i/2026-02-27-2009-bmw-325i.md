### Summary Verdict
The 2009 BMW 325i offers a rewarding driving experience, but potential owners should be aware of common issues. The N52 engine, while generally robust, can develop leaks from the valve cover or oil pan gaskets, and the PCV system is a known failure point. Automatic transmissions may experience fluid leaks or torque converter problems. On the suspension, worn bushings and leaking shocks are not uncommon. Electrical gremlins can manifest as window regulator failures or headlight ballast issues. Interior concerns often revolve around the HVAC blower motor and occasional iDrive system glitches. Despite these potential issues, many 325i models remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
