The 2004 BMW 325i is a popular entry-level luxury sedan known for its engaging driving dynamics and classic BMW styling. Engine options included the 2.5L inline-6 cylinder M56 engine (184 horsepower, 175 lb-ft of torque) and a 5-speed manual transmission, 5-speed automatic transmission, or SMG transmission. People generally like the car's handling, build quality (for its age), and relatively fuel-efficient engine. Common complaints revolve around higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles and the age-related wear and tear affecting many components.

**Engine**

**2.5L M56 Inline-6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak from the valve cover gasket, leading to oil burning smell and possible oil loss. Visible oil around the valve cover.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Component Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks from hoses, expansion tank, water pump, or thermostat housing.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty cooling system components. Typically, it's recommended to replace multiple components at once (e.g., water pump, thermostat, hoses, expansion tank) to avoid repeat failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on the number of components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **DISA Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, loss of power, check engine light with codes related to the DISA valve. A rattling noise might be heard from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the DISA valve. Aftermarket rebuild kits exist for less severe failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, rough idle, and emissions test failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (depending on the number of sensors needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (GM A5S390R)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, or shifts roughly. This can be more noticeable when cold.
    *   Solution: A full transmission replacement or rebuild is sometimes necessary. Some have success with a fluid flush and filter change, but this is not a guaranteed fix for severe slipping.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $350 (fluid flush and filter), $2000 - $4000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially during lockup of the torque converter. Can also cause stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a full transmission rebuild might be recommended if there is excessive wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

* No Issues Found

**SMG**

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting, inability to select gears, or warning lights indicating a problem with the SMG system. The pump may be unusually noisy before failing completely.
    *   Solution: Replace the SMG hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar symptoms to hydraulic pump failure, but may also include erratic clutch engagement.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and leaking fluid from the strut/shock.
    *   Solution: Replace the struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 BMW 325i is prone to several age-related issues, particularly in the cooling system, suspension, and electrical components. Engine issues like valve cover leaks and DISA valve failures are also common. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic and SMG options, can be expensive to repair. While many of these issues are not catastrophic, they can add up and lead to high maintenance costs over time. The severity and cost of repairs vary depending on the specific problem and the shop performing the work. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
