### Summary Verdict
The 2012 BMW 325i (E90) is a well-built vehicle with a generally good reliability record, especially concerning its powertrain. The naturally aspirated N52 inline-six engine is robust, though common age-related issues like oil leaks from gaskets (valve cover, oil pan) and PCV system failures can occur. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, are typically durable, but specific components like the automatic transmission's mechatronic unit or torque converter can require attention over time. Suspension components, particularly bushings and shocks, are prone to wear due to the car's sporty nature and age. Electrical gremlins are less common but can include window regulators and HVAC resistors. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing these known potential issues, the 2012 325i can remain a reliable and enjoyable car.
