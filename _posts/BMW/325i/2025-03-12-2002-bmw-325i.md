**Summary**

The 2002 BMW 325i is a generally well-regarded car, but age and mileage have brought some common issues to light. The engine is prone to oil leaks and cooling system failures, and the automatic transmission can suffer from slipping and harsh shifting. Suspension issues, especially with control arm bushings, are also common. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulator and ABS module failures, can also surface. Interior issues, like pixel loss and door panel sagging, are relatively minor but can detract from the ownership experience. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the repair method chosen. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs due to the vehicle's age.
