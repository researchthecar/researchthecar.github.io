The 2016 BMW 428i is a popular luxury coupe, grand coupe (4-door), and convertible that balances sporty handling with everyday comfort. Powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, it delivers 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 428i was also available with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine in the 435i variant, producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 428i for its stylish design, engaging driving experience, and relatively good fuel economy. Criticisms often include the cramped rear seats (especially in the coupe), the high cost of maintenance, and occasional electronic gremlins.
