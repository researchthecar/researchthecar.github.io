**Summary**

The 2017 BMW 440i, while a desirable vehicle, can experience several common issues. Engine and transmission problems, such as oil leaks, timing chain issues (particularly for the 2.0L), and rough shifting, can be costly to repair. Suspension issues like control arm bushing failures and strut leaks can also impact ride quality and handling. Electrical gremlins like battery drain and iDrive malfunctions are also common complaints.
