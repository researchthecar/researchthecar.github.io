The 2018 BMW 440i is a popular choice for those seeking a blend of performance and luxury in a coupe, convertible, or Gran Coupe (four-door coupe) package. The model is generally praised for its responsive handling, powerful engine, and stylish design. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues.  The 440i came standard with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine (B58) producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. This engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission (rare) or an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the smooth power delivery and quick acceleration. Dislikes often revolve around the cost of maintenance and the potential for electrical gremlins.

**Engine**

**B58 3.0L Turbocharged Inline-Six**

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common around the valve cover gasket, leading to a burning smell, visible oil residue on the engine, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

*   **Timing Chain Issues (Early B58 Variants)**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  While less common in the 2018 model year, some early B58 engines experienced timing chain stretch or failure.  Symptoms include a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold, and potential engine misfires. This issue isn't as prevalent in later model years, but still worth noting.
