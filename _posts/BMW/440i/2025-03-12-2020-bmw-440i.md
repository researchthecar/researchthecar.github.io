The 2020 BMW 440i is a sporty coupe/gran coupe/convertible known for its blend of performance, luxury, and driving dynamics. The 440i comes standard with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (B58) producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 4 Series in other trims include the 2.0-liter inline-4 (B48) in the 430i, rated at 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 440i is available with either an 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission (though the manual is rarer). Owners typically praise the 440i for its smooth and powerful engine, agile handling, and upscale interior. Some common complaints include the somewhat firm ride, particularly with the optional sport suspension, and the iDrive infotainment system's initial learning curve, as well as a generally smaller back seat.
