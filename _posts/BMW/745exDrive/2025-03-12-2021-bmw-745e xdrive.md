The 2021 BMW 745e xDrive is a plug-in hybrid luxury sedan that offers a blend of performance and efficiency. Its powertrain consists of a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 389 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available on the 7-Series for that model year include a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (non-hybrid), a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8, and a 6.6-liter twin-turbo V12 (depending on the specific 7-Series model). The 745e xDrive is generally praised for its luxurious interior, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. However, some owners have reported issues with the hybrid system, electrical components, and some trim pieces.

**Electric Motor**

**Hybrid Motor**

*   **Hybrid System Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may display a warning message indicating a problem with the hybrid system. This can manifest as reduced power, inability to use electric mode, or complete system failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified BMW technician is necessary to pinpoint the cause, which could range from a faulty sensor to a failing battery pack or motor component. Software updates may sometimes resolve the issue, but component replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Reduced Electric Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable decrease in the distance the vehicle can travel on electric power alone compared to the original range. Could be caused by a battery management system issue.
    *   Solution: Battery management system diagnostics and potential recalibration. Battery cell testing and possible replacement of individual modules or the entire battery pack if degradation is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $15,000+ (depending on the extent of the battery degradation and repairs needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Rough Shifting/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of rough or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds. The transmission may hesitate or clunk when shifting between gears.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection of the transmission may be required, potentially leading to valve body repair or replacement. In rare cases, a complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $7,000+ (depending on the extent of the issue)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system may fail, leading to the vehicle sitting low on one or more corners, ride height inconsistencies, or a "Suspension Malfunction" warning on the dashboard. This could be due to a faulty air strut, compressor, or air line leak.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the failing component. Replacement of the affected air strut, compressor, or air line. System calibration after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (per strut, compressor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, or lagging of the iDrive infotainment system. Connectivity problems with Bluetooth or Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software update for the iDrive system. In more severe cases, replacement of the iDrive control unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $2,000+ (for control unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Driver Assistance Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alarms or non-operation of parking sensors, lane departure warning, or adaptive cruise control systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor and recalibration of the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle failing to charge, slow charging speeds, or error messages related to charging.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the charging cable, charging port, and onboard charger. Software updates or replacement of the onboard charger may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Trunk Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Trunk failing to open or close automatically, getting stuck, or making unusual noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the trunk motor, sensors, and hinges. Replacement of faulty components or lubrication of moving parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Adjustment Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power seats failing to adjust properly, getting stuck in a position, or making grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the seat motor, gears, and wiring harness. Replacement of faulty components.
