*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cooling system is a known weak point. Components like the water pump, thermostat, expansion tank, and radiator can fail over time, leading to overheating. Symptoms include rising temperature gauge, steam from the engine bay, and coolant leaks. Plastic components are known to become brittle with age.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failing components is necessary. It's often recommended to replace the entire cooling system preventatively.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the parts replaced and labor.
