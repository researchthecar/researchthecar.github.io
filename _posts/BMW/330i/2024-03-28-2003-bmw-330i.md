**Introduction:**

The 2003 BMW 330i is a compact luxury sedan powered by a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine producing 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. It comes standard with a 5-speed manual transmission and offers a 5-speed automatic transmission as an option. The 330i is praised for its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and upscale appointments.

**Engine**

**3.0L Inline-6**

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket, causing smoke and a burning oil smell. Replace the valve cover gasket. $500 - $1,000
* **Vanos Solenoid Failure:** The Vanos solenoid controls the timing of the variable valve timing system. A faulty solenoid can lead to reduced engine power, rough idle, and stalling. Replace the Vanos solenoid. $400 - $800
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner keeps the timing chain in place. A failed tensioner can allow the chain to skip teeth, causing engine damage. Replace the timing chain tensioner. $1,500 - $3,000

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Shift Linkage Failure:** The shift linkage connects the gear selector to the transmission. A failed linkage can make it difficult or impossible to shift gears. Replace the shift linkage. $200 - $500

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slippage:** The transmission slips gears while driving, causing a loss of power and acceleration. Overhaul or replace the transmission. $2,000 - $5,000+
* **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter transfers power from the engine to the transmission. A failed converter can cause shuddering, slipping, and overheating. Replace the torque converter. $1,000 - $2,000

**Suspension**

* **Control Arm Bushing Wear:** The control arm bushings wear out over time, causing clunking noises and reduced handling. Replace the control arm bushings. $400 - $800
* **Strut Mount Failure:** The strut mounts support the front struts. A failed mount can cause noise, vibration, and reduced ride quality. Replace the strut mounts. $500 - $1,000
* **Sway Bar Link Failure:** The sway bar links connect the sway bar to the suspension. A failed link can cause clunking noises and reduced stability. Replace the sway bar links. $200 - $400

**Electrical**

* **Headlight Switch Failure:** The headlight switch fails to turn on or off the headlights. Replace the headlight switch. $200 - $400
* **Battery Drain:** The battery drains quickly even when the car is not in use. Check for parasitic draw on the electrical system. Diagnosis and repair costs vary.
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator fails to charge the battery, leading to a dead battery and electrical problems. Replace the alternator. $500 - $1,000
