The 2019 BMW 330i (G20 generation) marks the beginning of a new era for the iconic sports sedan. It's generally praised for its improved handling, modern interior, and updated technology. The 330i comes standard with a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the G20 generation (though not necessarily in the 2019 330i in all markets) include a variety of inline-6 engines and a hybrid powertrain. A significant number of owners appreciate the car's blend of performance, comfort, and driver engagement, although some have complained about reliability issues, particularly with the electronic systems, as well as some build quality concerns. The 2019 330i exclusively came with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, often noticed by a low coolant warning light or visible coolant pooling under the car. Leaks may originate from the coolant expansion tank or various hoses and connections.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the leak and replace the faulty component (expansion tank, hose, clamp, etc.). Pressure testing the cooling system helps pinpoint the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the leak and parts required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various seals and gaskets, leading to oil consumption and potential low oil warning lights. Common areas include the valve cover gasket and the oil filter housing gasket.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the affected gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location of the leak and associated labor.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifts, especially during low-speed driving or when accelerating. This can manifest as a noticeable clunk or hesitation between gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update for the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In other cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may help. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or transmission overhaul/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement) depending on the severity and repair required.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the severity and source of the noise. Can vary significantly depending on if the work is completed by the owner or a shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 BMW 330i, while praised for its driving dynamics and modern features, has exhibited some common issues, particularly with the engine (coolant and oil leaks), transmission (rough shifting), and electrical systems (iDrive issues). Interior rattles are also a recurring complaint. While some problems can be resolved with software updates or relatively inexpensive repairs, others, such as transmission issues, can be costly. The severity of the issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchase, paying close attention to any warning lights, unusual noises, or electronic system malfunctions.
