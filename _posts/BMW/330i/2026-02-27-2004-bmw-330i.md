### Summary Verdict
The 2004 BMW 330i (E46) is a desirable performance sedan with a generally strong reliability record for its class and age. The M54B30 engine is robust but prone to common BMW oil leaks and cooling system issues that require attention. Transmission reliability is good, though clutch wear on manuals and potential torque converter issues on automatics are noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, leading to handling degradation. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and ABS/DSC modules, can be costly but are not universal. Interior wear, such as sagging headliners and pixelated displays, is common for vehicles of this vintage. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning the cooling system and addressing oil leaks promptly, is key to maintaining the 330i's excellent driving experience.
