The 2022 BMW 330i is a popular luxury sedan known for its engaging driving dynamics and refined interior. The 330i primarily features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. While the 330e plug-in hybrid and the performance-oriented M340i (with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6) are also available, this analysis focuses on the standard 330i with the 2.0L engine. Owners often praise the 330i's sharp handling, comfortable ride, and upscale cabin. However, some common complaints include the cost of maintenance and repairs, the complexity of the infotainment system, and the availability of some features as optional extras rather than standard equipment.
