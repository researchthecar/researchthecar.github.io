The 2001 BMW 330i is a popular sports sedan known for its balanced handling, responsive engine, and classic BMW styling. It was available with two engine options: the 2.5L inline-6 (325i) and the 3.0L inline-6 (330i). The 330i's 3.0L M54 engine produces 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. Both engines came standard with a 5-speed manual transmission, with an optional 5-speed automatic transmission available. Owners often praise the car's driving dynamics, precise steering, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include the relatively high cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as some age-related reliability issues that can arise in older models.

**Summary**

The 2001 BMW 330i, while a desirable car to own, is now over 20 years old, so most issues stem from age and wear. The most common issues revolve around the engine, cooling system, and electrical components. Oil leaks, cooling system failures, and electrical issues like window regulators are frequent concerns. Suspension components, such as control arm bushings and strut mounts, also require attention. Rust can be a significant problem, depending on the vehicle's location and maintenance history. Automatic transmissions can have issues due to their age. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, with some fixes being relatively inexpensive and others requiring substantial investment.
