The 2021 BMW 330i is a popular luxury sedan known for its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and refined driving experience. It's powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a more powerful turbocharged inline-six in the M340i, and a plug-in hybrid variant, the 330e. Transmissions are primarily an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 330i's responsive engine, precise steering, and well-balanced chassis. However, some common criticisms include the cost of maintenance, the complexity of the iDrive infotainment system, and the availability of more engaging alternatives in the segment.
