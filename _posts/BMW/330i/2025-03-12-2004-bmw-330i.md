The 2004 BMW 330i is a popular sports sedan known for its balanced handling, engaging driving experience, and classic BMW styling. It's powered by a 3.0L inline-six engine (M54) that produces 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic, and a Sequential Manual Gearbox (SMG) were the available transmission options. Owners often praise the 330i for its responsive engine, precise steering, and overall build quality. Common criticisms include the relatively high maintenance costs associated with BMW ownership, and the potential for certain components to fail with age.

**Summary**

The 2004 BMW 330i is a desirable vehicle, but owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs. Common issues include engine oil leaks, cooling system failures, suspension wear, and electrical problems. The SMG transmission, if equipped, can be particularly expensive to repair. Overall, addressing these issues can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing gaskets and bushings to more substantial repairs such as transmission overhauls and suspension component replacements. Pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance are crucial to minimizing unexpected expenses.
