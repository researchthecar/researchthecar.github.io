The 2016 BMW 320i xDrive is an entry-level luxury sedan known for its sporty handling, comfortable ride, and premium interior. The 320i xDrive came standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2016 3 Series included a 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder producing 240 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque in the 328i, a 3.0-liter inline-six with 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque in the 340i, and a diesel 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder engine producing 180 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque in the 328d. All engines were available with an 8-speed automatic transmission, but the 320i and 328i also had the option of a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners generally praise the 320i xDrive for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and overall driving experience. However, some common complaints include the relatively low horsepower output compared to other 3 Series models, the cost of maintenance and repairs, and potential reliability issues.
