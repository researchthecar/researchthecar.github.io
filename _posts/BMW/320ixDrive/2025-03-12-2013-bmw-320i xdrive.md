The 2013 BMW 320i xDrive is a compact luxury sedan known for its sporty handling and fuel efficiency. It features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine, producing 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. The car comes standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2013 BMW 320i xDrive can be a reliable car, but owners should be aware of the potential issues, particularly with the engine (oil leaks, timing chain) and transmission (rough shifting). Suspension components like the subframe bushings can also cause problems. These repairs can be moderately expensive, so a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended. While the electrical and exterior issues are less common, they can still be a nuisance. The most severe issues relate to the engine and could cost several thousand dollars to repair.
