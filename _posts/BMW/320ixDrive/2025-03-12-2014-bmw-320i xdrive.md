The 2014 BMW 320i xDrive is a compact executive sedan known for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and BMW's signature driving experience. The 320i xDrive comes with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2014 3 Series include the 328i's more powerful 2.0-liter turbo (240 hp), the 335i's 3.0-liter inline-six turbo (300 hp), and a diesel engine in the 328d (180 hp). The 320i xDrive came standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's nimble handling, stylish interior, and fuel economy. Criticisms often include a somewhat firm ride, especially with the sport suspension, and the base engine can feel a bit underpowered compared to the more potent options. Some also find the infotainment system a bit complex to use.
