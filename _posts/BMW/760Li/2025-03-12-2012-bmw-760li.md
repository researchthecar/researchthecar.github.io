**Engine**

**N74B60 6.0L Twin-Turbo V12**

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets, Oil Filter Housing)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue on aging V12 engines. Valve cover gaskets and the oil filter housing are prone to leaking, leading to oil spots under the car, a burning oil smell, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets and reseal the oil filter housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+ (V12 engine access increases labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks (Coolant Transfer Pipe, Radiator Hoses)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points in the cooling system. The coolant transfer pipe that runs between the cylinder heads is a known weak point. Leaks lead to low coolant levels, overheating, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking components. This can involve replacing the coolant transfer pipe, hoses, water pump, or radiator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ depending on the component and labor involved.

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection V12 engines can experience fuel injector problems. Symptoms include rough idling, misfires, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) and replace them. In some cases, cleaning may temporarily alleviate the issue, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on how many injectors need replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 8HP90 8-Speed Automatic**

    *   Description/Symptoms: The ZF 8HP transmissions can sometimes experience valve body issues. Symptoms include harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, and transmission malfunction warnings.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the valve body. In some cases, a software update may help, but often physical repair/replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether the valve body is rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Sleeve Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic sleeve seals the electrical connector to the transmission and can leak over time. This leads to transmission fluid loss and potential electrical issues within the transmission.
