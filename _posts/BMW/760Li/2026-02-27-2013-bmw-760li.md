### Summary Verdict
The 2013 BMW 760Li, while a pinnacle of automotive engineering and luxury, presents a reliability profile typical of high-performance, complex luxury sedans. The V12 engine, while powerful, can be a source of significant repair costs, particularly concerning ignition coils, turbochargers, and potential oil leaks. The advanced suspension systems, while offering superior ride comfort and handling, are also prone to costly repairs if components like active roll stabilization or air springs fail. Electrical gremlins, especially within the iDrive system and various actuators (door locks, headlights, seats), are not uncommon and can be expensive to rectify. Transmission reliability is generally strong. Owners should be prepared for higher maintenance and repair expenditures compared to less complex vehicles, and diligent maintenance is crucial to mitigate potential issues.
