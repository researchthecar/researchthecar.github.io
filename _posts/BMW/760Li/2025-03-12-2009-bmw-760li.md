The 2009 BMW 760Li represents the pinnacle of luxury from the E65/E66 generation. This model features a potent 6.0L N73 V12 engine, producing around 438 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. Other available engines include a range of inline-6 and V8 options. The 760Li is known for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and abundance of high-tech features for its time. However, owners often find the complex electronics and sophisticated systems to be a source of potential headaches, leading to higher maintenance costs. Some appreciate the car's powerful engine and luxurious amenities, while others are put off by its intricate repair requirements and potential for expensive component failures.

**Engine**

**6.0L N73 V12**

*   **Oil Leaks from Valve Cover Gaskets**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are commonly reported, often manifesting as a burning smell or visible oil accumulation on the engine. The valve cover gaskets tend to harden and crack over time, leading to seepage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can develop from various points in the cooling system, including hoses, radiator, expansion tank, and water pump. Overheating is a common symptom if the leaks are significant.
    *   Solution: Identify and replace the leaking component. This could involve replacing hoses, the expansion tank, water pump or radiator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the part)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VANOS (Variable Valve Timing) system can experience issues with solenoids or seals, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of faulty VANOS components (solenoids, seals, or potentially the VANOS unit itself).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (ZF 6HP26)**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, and a general lack of smooth operation are common complaints. This is often related to wear in the transmission's internal components or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid flush and filter change may provide temporary relief. However, a more permanent solution usually involves valve body repair/replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 (fluid flush) - $4000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Sleeve Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the mechatronic sleeve, which seals the electrical connector to the transmission, are fairly common. This can lead to low transmission fluid levels and potential shifting problems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the mechatronic sleeve and associated seals. A transmission fluid flush is typically done at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear air suspension is prone to issues, including compressor failure, air leaks from struts or lines, and sagging or uneven ride height.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of faulty components, which may include the air compressor, air struts, or air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can lead to clunking noises, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system (infotainment) can experience various glitches, including freezing, slow response times, and failure of certain functions (navigation, audio, etc.).
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve the issue. However, more severe problems may require replacement of the iDrive control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $1500+ (control unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur due to various electrical issues, such as a faulty module not going to sleep, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the underlying cause of the battery drain. This may involve replacing a faulty module, disconnecting aftermarket accessories, or replacing the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Comfort Access Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the comfort access system (keyless entry and start) are common, including failure to detect the key, door handles not responding, and difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of faulty door handle sensors, key fobs, or control modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

**Summary**

The 2009 BMW 760Li, while a luxurious and powerful vehicle, is prone to a number of potentially expensive issues. The most significant problems revolve around the engine (oil and coolant leaks, VANOS), transmission (slipping, mechatronic sleeve leaks), and electrical system (iDrive malfunctions, battery drain, comfort access). Suspension issues such as air suspension problems are also common. While some repairs are relatively minor, others can be very costly, making thorough pre-purchase inspection crucial. Due to the complexity and cost of repairs, potential buyers should factor in a substantial budget for maintenance and repairs.
