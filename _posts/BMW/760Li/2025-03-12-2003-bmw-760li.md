The 2003 BMW 760Li represents the pinnacle of luxury and performance from the E65/E66 generation. Powered by a 6.0L V12 engine producing 438 horsepower and 444 lb-ft of torque, it offers effortless power and a refined driving experience. The V12 is paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the car's opulent interior, advanced technology for its time, and smooth ride. Conversely, the complex electronics and high maintenance costs are common complaints. Other engine options for the 2003 BMW 7 Series included the 3.6L inline-6, 4.4L V8, and the 3.0L inline-6 diesel (depending on market). The 760Li specifically, however, came only with the V12.
