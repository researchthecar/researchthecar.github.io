**Summary**

The 2021 BMW 550i, while a high-performance luxury vehicle, can present some reliability concerns. The most common issues involve oil and coolant leaks from the V8 engine, and some rough shifting of the transmission. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and sensors are also reported. Suspension malfunctions, while less frequent, can also be costly to repair. While not every 550i will experience these issues, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for these problems and factor in the higher maintenance and repair costs associated with a luxury vehicle. The severity and cost of these issues can vary significantly, with some repairs costing hundreds of dollars and others potentially exceeding several thousand.
