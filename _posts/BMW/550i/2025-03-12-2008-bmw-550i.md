*   **Valve Stem Seal Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, especially on start-up after the car has been sitting. This issue is due to the valve stem seals hardening and cracking over time, allowing oil to leak into the combustion chamber.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve stem seals. This is a labor-intensive job as it often requires removing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Transfer Pipe Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak often found at the rear of the engine, resulting in coolant loss and potential overheating. The pipe runs under the intake manifold and is made of plastic, which becomes brittle over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the coolant transfer pipe with an updated aluminum version is recommended for better durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (due to the labor-intensive nature of removing the intake manifold)
    *   Recalls: None Found
