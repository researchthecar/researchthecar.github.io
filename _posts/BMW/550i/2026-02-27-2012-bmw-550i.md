### Summary Verdict
The 2012 BMW 550i offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury. However, its advanced twin-turbo V8 engine and sophisticated electronic systems can be sources of significant repair costs if issues arise. Common concerns include turbocharger problems, fuel injector failures, and oil consumption related to valve stem seals. The transmission, while generally robust, can suffer from mechatronic unit or torque converter issues. The adaptive suspension systems, while enhancing driving dynamics, are also prone to expensive electronic failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system and battery drain, are also noted. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair costs, especially for out-of-warranty vehicles, and a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
