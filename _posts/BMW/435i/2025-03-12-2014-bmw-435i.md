The 2014 BMW 435i marked the introduction of the 4 Series, essentially a coupe and convertible version of the 3 Series sedan. This model year offered a blend of sporty handling, luxurious features, and a refined driving experience that appealed to a wide range of drivers. The standard engine for the 435i was the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, known as the N55, producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. This engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or an 8-speed automatic transmission.

Some of the biggest dislikes of the car are the expensive maintenance costs, the cramped rear seats, and the uninspired steering feel.
