### Summary Verdict
The 2015 BMW 435i demonstrates good overall reliability, with its potent N55 engine and ZF 8-speed automatic transmission being robust. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the cooling system (water pump) and specific engine components like the PCV valve and wastegate actuator, which can develop problems with age and mileage. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system, are also noted but often resolvable with software updates. While not immune to issues, proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of trouble can ensure a rewarding ownership experience for this performance-oriented coupe.
