### Summary Verdict
The 2011 BMW 323i offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly with its robust inline-six engine. The most common reported issues tend to be related to gasket leaks (valve cover and oil pan) and the PCV system, which are not uncommon for BMWs of this era and are typically manageable. The automatic transmission, while generally good, can experience issues with the mechatronic unit or torque converter, which can be costly to repair. The manual transmission is largely trouble-free. Other systems like suspension, exterior, and interior components show good reliability. Proactive maintenance, especially regarding fluid changes and addressing early signs of leaks, is recommended to ensure the longevity of this sporty sedan.
