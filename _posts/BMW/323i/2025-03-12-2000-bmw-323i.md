Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2000 BMW 323i, categorized for clarity. This model year falls within the E46 generation, known for its blend of sporty handling and refined comfort, but also its propensity for certain reliability issues as it ages. The 2000 323i is equipped with a 2.5-liter inline-6 cylinder engine (M52TUB25) producing 170 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the car's engaging driving dynamics, precise steering, and classic BMW styling. Dislikes often center around the cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as the increasing likelihood of component failures due to age. Other engine options in this generation include the M54 engine in later model years. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic.

**Engine**
