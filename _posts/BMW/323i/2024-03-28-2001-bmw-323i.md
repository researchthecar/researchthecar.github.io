Transmission problems can range from minor issues like shift solenoid failure to major issues like torque converter failure. Suspension components, such as control arm bushings and shock absorber mounts, may wear out over time. Electrical problems, such as alternator failure and battery drain, can also occur. Interior components like window regulators and door lock actuators may also fail. Rust on the undercarriage is a potential concern, especially if the vehicle is driven in areas with harsh winters.
