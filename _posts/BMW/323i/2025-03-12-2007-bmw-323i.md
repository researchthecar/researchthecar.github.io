**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-6 (N52B25)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks often occur from the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, or oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket. It's often recommended to replace the valve cover itself if warped.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location of the leak and shop rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Variable Valve Timing (VANOS) solenoids can fail, causing rough idling, loss of power, and potential check engine lights with VANOS-related fault codes.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty VANOS solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on if one or both solenoids need to be replaced, and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body can experience wear and tear, leading to hard or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild. Transmission flush and fluid change may temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but the root cause usually requires addressing the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+ depending on whether the valve body is rebuilt, replaced, or if a full transmission rebuild is necessary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 BMW 323i, while offering a pleasant driving experience, is prone to certain issues as it ages. Engine oil leaks, VANOS problems, and transmission issues are among the more significant concerns, potentially leading to costly repairs. Electrical problems, such as battery drain and window regulator failures, are also relatively common. Suspension components like control arm bushings are likely to require replacement due to wear and tear. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be more extensive, making pre-purchase inspections and careful maintenance crucial for ownership. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls.
