The 2017 BMW 420i is a stylish and sporty coupe, gran coupe, or convertible known for its agile handling and refined driving experience. The 420i comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available on the 4 Series platform for 2017 include the more powerful 430i with a higher-output version of the 2.0-liter turbo-four, and the 440i with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six. Transmission choices were primarily an 8-speed automatic, although a 6-speed manual was available on some models. Owners generally appreciate the 420i's elegant design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving dynamics. However, some criticisms include the relatively high cost of ownership, somewhat cramped rear seats (especially in the coupe), and the potential for certain reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2017 BMW 420i, while generally a well-regarded vehicle, does have some common issues. Engine oil leaks and potential timing chain problems (especially with the N20 engine) can be costly. The ZF 8-speed transmission can also exhibit issues like rough shifting or mechatronic unit failure. Electrical gremlins, like battery drain or iDrive malfunctions, can also occur. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchasing.
