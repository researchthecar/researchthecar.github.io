The 2022 BMW X3 is a popular compact luxury SUV that offers a blend of performance, practicality, and refinement. It comes with several engine options: the base 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (248 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque), the more powerful 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 (382 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque in the M40i trim), and a plug-in hybrid variant combining the 2.0L turbo-4 with an electric motor (288 hp combined). All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically praise the X3 for its sporty handling, comfortable ride, upscale interior, and ample cargo space. Common complaints often revolve around the complex iDrive infotainment system, the relatively firm ride quality (especially with larger wheels), and some reported reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2022 BMW X3 is generally a reliable vehicle, but some common issues have been reported. Engine oil leaks and cooling issues can occur, especially in the 2.0L turbocharged engine, while transmission concerns, specifically rough shifting, are present across all engine options paired with the 8-speed automatic. Electrical problems, mainly with the iDrive system and sensor malfunctions, also surface occasionally. Interior rattles are less serious but can be annoying.  The severity and cost of these issues vary, but transmission replacements and complex electrical repairs can be expensive. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems before buying.
