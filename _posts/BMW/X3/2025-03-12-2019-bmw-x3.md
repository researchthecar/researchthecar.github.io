The 2019 BMW X3 is a popular compact luxury SUV praised for its blend of sporty handling, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. Engine options include the base 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (248 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque) found in the xDrive30i, and the more powerful 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six (355 hp and 365 lb-ft of torque) in the M40i.
