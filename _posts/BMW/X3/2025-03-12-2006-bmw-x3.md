The 2006 BMW X3 marked the third year of production for the model, offering a blend of BMW's driving dynamics in a compact SUV package. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-6 producing 184 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L inline-6 generating 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the X3's sporty handling and solid build quality, but some disliked its firm ride and relatively cramped rear seating. Common complaints also revolved around maintenance costs and certain electrical issues.
