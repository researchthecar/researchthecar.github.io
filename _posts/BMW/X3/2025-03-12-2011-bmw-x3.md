The 2011 BMW X3 (F25) marked a significant redesign of the popular compact SUV. It offered a more spacious interior, improved driving dynamics, and updated technology compared to its predecessor. In the US market, the 2011 X3 was available with two engine options: the xDrive28i with a 3.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-six (N52) producing 240 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, and the xDrive35i with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six (N55) generating 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the X3's blend of luxury, sporty handling, and practicality. However, common complaints include electrical issues, some reliability concerns, and relatively high repair costs.

**Summary**

The 2011 BMW X3, particularly the xDrive35i variant, offers a powerful and engaging driving experience but can be prone to several issues. Engine oil leaks and electrical problems are relatively common across both engine options. The xDrive35i's turbocharged engine brings additional concerns like wastegate rattle and potential HPFP failure. Transmission issues, although not universal, can be costly to address. While some repairs are relatively minor, others, like turbocharger or valve body replacement, can be significant expenses. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
