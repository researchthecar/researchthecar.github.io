**Summary**

The 2007 BMW X3, while praised for its handling and interior, can suffer from several reliability issues. The most common problems involve oil leaks from the engine, particularly the valve cover and oil filter housing gaskets. Suspension components, especially the front control arm bushings and rear subframe bushings, are also prone to wear. Electrical issues, such as transfer case actuator gear failure and power window regulator problems, can also occur. Interior components, like the sunroof, are also prone to failure. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for simple fixes to over a thousand dollars for more complex issues like transmission valve body replacement or extensive suspension work. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential maintenance costs when considering a 2007 BMW X3.
