The 2018 BMW X3 marked the beginning of the G01 generation, offering a blend of luxury, performance, and practicality. Available engine options included a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (B46/B48) producing around 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque in the xDrive30i model, and a 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 (B58) generating approximately 355 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque in the M40i. All models were equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the X3's comfortable ride, sporty handling, and high-quality interior. Some common dislikes include the sometimes-complex infotainment system and the higher cost of maintenance compared to non-luxury vehicles.
