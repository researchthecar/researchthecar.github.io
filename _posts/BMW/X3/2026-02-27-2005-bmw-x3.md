### Summary Verdict
The 2005 BMW X3, particularly with the inline-6 engines, is known for potential oil leaks and cooling system issues, which are common for BMWs of this era. The automatic transmission can also develop problems with harsh shifting. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts are also areas to inspect due to wear. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and ABS modules, are not uncommon. While the manual transmission and exterior components tend to be more reliable, prospective buyers should budget for potential repairs related to the engine, transmission, and suspension. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these issues.
