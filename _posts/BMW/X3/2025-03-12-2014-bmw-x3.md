The 2014 BMW X3 is a popular compact luxury SUV that offers a blend of performance, practicality, and BMW's signature driving experience. Engine options included a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (240 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque) known as the xDrive28i, and a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (300 hp, 300 lb-ft of torque) known as the xDrive35i. All models came standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically appreciate the X3's agile handling, comfortable ride, spacious interior, and upscale cabin. Common complaints often revolve around repair costs, some electrical gremlins, and the run-flat tires which can contribute to a harsher ride.
