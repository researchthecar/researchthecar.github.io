The 2013 BMW X3 is a compact luxury SUV known for its sporty handling, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. Available engine options include the 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (240 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque) and the 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 (300 hp, 300 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the X3's driving dynamics and premium features but sometimes express concerns about reliability and maintenance costs. Some owners dislike the run-flat tires and their harsh ride, as well as the complex electronics that can be prone to failure.
