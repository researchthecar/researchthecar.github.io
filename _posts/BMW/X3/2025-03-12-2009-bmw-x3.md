The 2009 BMW X3 is a compact luxury SUV known for its sporty handling and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-6 producing 215 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L inline-6 producing 260 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the X3's driving dynamics and upscale interior.
