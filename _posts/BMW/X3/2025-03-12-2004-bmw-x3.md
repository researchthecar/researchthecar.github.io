The 2004 BMW X3 marked the entry of BMW into the compact luxury SUV market. It offered a blend of BMW's driving dynamics with the practicality of an SUV. The 2004 model came with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-6 engine producing 184 hp and 175 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L inline-6 engine producing 225 hp and 214 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciated the X3's sporty handling, spacious cargo area, and available all-wheel-drive system. Common complaints included the firm ride, some cheap interior trim pieces, and potential maintenance costs associated with BMW ownership.

**Summary**

The 2004 BMW X3, while offering a sporty driving experience, is prone to several common issues. Engine-related problems such as oil leaks and VANOS issues are common, particularly with both engine options. Transmission issues, specifically with the automatic transmission, can be costly to repair. Suspension problems, like control arm and subframe bushing failures, contribute to ride harshness and handling concerns. Electrical issues with window regulators and the ABS module are also frequently reported. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor to potentially very expensive, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential. Due to the age of these cars, many rubber components are starting to fail.
