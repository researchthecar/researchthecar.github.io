The 2010 BMW X3 (E83 generation) is a compact luxury SUV that offers a blend of sporty handling and practicality. The X3 was available with two engine options in the US market: a 3.0-liter inline-6 naturally aspirated engine (3.0i) producing 260 hp and 225 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter inline-6 turbocharged engine (3.0si) producing 260 hp and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the X3's agile handling, comfortable front seats, and premium interior materials. Common complaints include a firm ride, cramped rear seats, and some reliability concerns, particularly with electrical components and oil leaks.

Engine oil leaks, particularly from the oil filter housing and valve cover gaskets, are common across both engine options. The 6-speed automatic transmission can experience slipping and harsh shifting, potentially requiring expensive repairs. Suspension components, like the control arm bushings and rear subframe bushings, are also known to fail. Electrical issues, such as faulty window regulators and sunroof malfunctions, can add to the ownership costs. While some repairs are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential.
