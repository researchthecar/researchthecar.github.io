### Summary Verdict
The 2000 BMW X5, while offering a premium driving experience, exhibits common issues typical for its age and German engineering. The cooling system, valve cover gaskets, and VANOS system on the V8 engines are frequent culprits for leaks and performance degradation. The automatic transmission can develop shifting problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and ABS modules, are not uncommon. Despite these potential issues, many X5s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and timely repairs, especially those with the inline-6 engine and manual transmission, which tend to be slightly less problematic.
