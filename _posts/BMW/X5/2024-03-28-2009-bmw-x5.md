### Summary

The 2009 BMW X5 is a luxurious and capable SUV, but it is not without its potential reliability concerns. The engine and transmission issues vary in severity and cost to fix, and can range from relatively minor to major repairs. Suspension and electrical problems are less common, but can also be costly to address. The X5's interior and exterior have some minor issues but overall the cabin is well-built. Some issues like the engine timing chain failure or the catastrophic connecting rod bearing failure on the 4.8L V8 can be very expensive to fix. It's important to consider the cost and frequency of these potential issues when purchasing a used BMW X5.
