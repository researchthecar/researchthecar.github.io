The 2001 BMW X5 (E53) marked BMW's entry into the SUV market, blending sporty handling with all-weather capability. It was available with several engine options, including a 3.0L inline-six (M54) producing around 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque, a 4.4L V8 (M62TU) making approximately 282 horsepower and 324 lb-ft of torque, and a later 4.6L V8 (M62TU) with around 340 horsepower and 350 lb-ft. Both automatic and manual transmissions were available depending on the engine. Owners often praised the X5's engaging driving experience and luxurious interior, but common complaints included high maintenance costs, electrical gremlins, and susceptibility to wear and tear due to its age.
