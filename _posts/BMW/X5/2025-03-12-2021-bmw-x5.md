Transmission issues, rough shifting, and electrical glitches in the iDrive system are also frequently reported. Suspension problems, particularly with the air suspension, can also be costly. While some issues can be resolved with software updates or relatively inexpensive repairs, others, such as turbocharger or mechatronic unit failures, can result in significant repair bills. It is important to consider these potential issues when purchasing a used 2021 BMW X5 and to obtain a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing problems.
