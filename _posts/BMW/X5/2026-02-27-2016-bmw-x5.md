### Summary Verdict
The 2016 BMW X5 generally exhibits good reliability, particularly with its robust powertrain options and well-built interior. The most commonly reported technical issues tend to be related to the turbochargers on gasoline engines, PCV valve failures, and potential DPF or EGR cooler issues on the diesel variant. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, can also occur. While the transmission is typically solid, air suspension systems (if equipped) may develop leaks over time. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of issues can help mitigate repair costs and ensure a positive ownership experience.
