### Summary Verdict
The 2012 BMW X5 presents a generally reliable package, especially with its well-regarded transmissions. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the turbocharged engines, particularly the N63 V8, which can experience issues with turbochargers, fuel injectors, and valve stem seals. The N55 inline-six is more robust but can still have turbocharger and PCV valve problems. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive glitches and battery drain, are also noted. For models equipped with air suspension, leaks are a potential, albeit often repairable, issue. Overall, while not immune to problems, many of the 2012 X5's potential issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
