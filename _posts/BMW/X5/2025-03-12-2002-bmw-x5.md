The 2002 BMW X5 (E53) marked BMW's entry into the SUV market, offering a blend of luxury, performance, and utility. Available engine options included a 3.0L inline-6 (M54) producing around 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.4L V8 (M62) producing around 290 horsepower and 324 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate the X5's sporty handling, luxurious interior, and overall driving experience. Common dislikes include high maintenance costs, electrical gremlins, and the vehicle's age leading to increased component failures. Both engines were primarily paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission.
