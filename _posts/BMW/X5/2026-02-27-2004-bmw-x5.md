### Summary Verdict
The 2004 BMW X5, while offering a premium driving experience, is not without its potential reliability concerns. The engines, particularly the V8 variants, can be prone to cooling system leaks and oil seal issues, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions, especially the 6-speed ZF unit, may develop issues with the mechatronic sleeve or torque converter. Suspension components, particularly the air suspension system, can be a source of expensive repairs. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and ABS modules, are also reported. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, issues like clogged sunroof drains can lead to water ingress. Prospective buyers should budget for potential repairs beyond standard maintenance, especially for higher mileage examples.
