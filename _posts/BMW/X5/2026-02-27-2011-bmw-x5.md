### Summary Verdict
The 2011 BMW X5 presents a generally solid reliability record, with its more complex engine options like the N54 twin-turbo inline-6 and the V8 requiring more attention to potential issues such as turbocharger problems, fuel injectors, and valve stem seals. The diesel variants can encounter DPF and glow plug issues. Transmission reliability is good, especially with the 8-speed automatic, though the 6-speed can experience leaks and torque converter problems. Suspension components like air compressors and bushings are known wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system and tail lights, can occur. Interior issues are less common, with sunroof drains being a notable point of attention. Overall, while not immune to problems, the X5 can be a dependable luxury SUV if well-maintained and potential issues are addressed promptly.
