**Summary**

The 2009 BMW X5, while a luxurious and capable SUV, is prone to several common issues, particularly concerning the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Engine issues, such as oil leaks, valve stem seal failures (especially in the V8), and HPFP problems (in the N54), can be expensive to address. Transmission issues like mechatronic unit failure can also lead to significant repair costs. Electrical problems, like battery drain issues, can be frustrating and difficult to diagnose. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in the potential maintenance costs associated with owning a vehicle of this age and complexity.
