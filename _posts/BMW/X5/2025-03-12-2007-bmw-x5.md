The 2007 BMW X5 (E70) marked a significant shift in BMW's SUV design language, offering more space and luxury compared to its predecessor. This model year offered a blend of performance and practicality, making it a popular choice. Available engine options included a 3.0-liter inline-6 (N52), producing around 260 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, a 4.8-liter V8 (N62) delivering approximately 350 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the X5's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine options. However, common complaints often revolve around the vehicle's higher maintenance costs, complex electronics, and potential for various mechanical issues.
