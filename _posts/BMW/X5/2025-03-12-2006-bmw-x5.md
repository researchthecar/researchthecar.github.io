The 2006 BMW X5 (E53) is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its sporty handling and comfortable ride. This year model offered a blend of luxury and utility that appealed to a wide range of buyers. However, like all vehicles, it has its share of common problems, particularly as it ages. Engine options included the 3.0L Inline-6 (225 hp, 214 lb-ft of torque), the 4.4L V8 (315 hp, 324 lb-ft of torque), and the 4.8L V8 (355 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with either a 5-speed automatic (early models) or a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the X5's driving dynamics, luxurious interior, and overall versatility. Common dislikes include higher maintenance costs, electrical issues, and the car's propensity for consuming fluids.
