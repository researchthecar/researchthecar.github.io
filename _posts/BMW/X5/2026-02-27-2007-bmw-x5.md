### Summary Verdict
The 2007 BMW X5, particularly with the V8 engine, can present some significant repair costs related to its cooling and oil systems. The inline-6 is generally more reliable but still susceptible to common BMW issues like valve cover gasket and PCV problems. Transmission issues, while not universal, can be costly to repair. Suspension components, especially the air suspension system, are also a known area for potential failure. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and headlight ballasts are also reported. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, potential buyers should be aware of these mechanical and electrical vulnerabilities, which are typical for a luxury vehicle of this age and complexity.
