### Summary Verdict
The 2013 BMW X5 demonstrates good overall reliability, especially concerning its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The turbocharged engines, while powerful, can be prone to specific issues like turbocharger problems, PCV valve failures (N55), and fuel system components (N63), which can be costly to repair. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission is generally robust, but mechatronic unit issues can arise. Suspension components, particularly air suspension systems and bushings, may require attention as mileage increases. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive glitches and battery drain, are not uncommon. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these specific areas, especially as the vehicle ages, but routine maintenance is key to mitigating many of these concerns.
