The 2016 BMW 640i is a luxury grand tourer known for its elegant styling, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. Available as a coupe, convertible, or Gran Coupe (four-door coupe), the 640i offers a blend of performance and sophistication. The 2016 640i is powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine producing 315 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 6 Series include a more powerful inline 6 producing 445 hp and a V8 producing 560 hp. All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the 640i for its smooth engine, luxurious interior, and comfortable long-distance cruising capabilities. However, some common complaints include relatively high running costs, complex electronics that can be prone to glitches, and limited rear-seat space in the coupe models.

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW 640i is a generally reliable luxury vehicle, but like any car, it has its share of potential problems.
