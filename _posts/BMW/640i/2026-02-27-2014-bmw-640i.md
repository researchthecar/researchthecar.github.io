### Summary Verdict
The 2014 BMW 640i is a reliable luxury vehicle, with its core powertrain components generally performing well. The 3.0L twin-turbocharged inline-six engine is robust, though potential issues like wastegate rattle, PCV valve failure, and water pump issues are documented and can be costly to repair. The 8-speed automatic transmission is highly regarded for its durability. Suspension components, particularly the adaptive systems, can be expensive if they fail. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive controller issues, are not uncommon in modern BMWs. The convertible top mechanism on the convertible variant is a potential point of failure. Overall, while not immune to problems, the 640i offers a good balance of performance and dependability for its class, provided regular maintenance is performed and potential issues are addressed promptly.
