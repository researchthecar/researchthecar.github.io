The 2017 BMW 640i is a luxury grand tourer known for its sleek design, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. It offers a blend of performance and luxury, making it a desirable vehicle for many. However, it's not without its potential issues. Common praises include its stylish appearance, comfortable interior, and strong acceleration. Common dislikes can be the high maintenance costs, cramped rear seating (especially in the coupe), and complex electronics. The 2017 640i is primarily powered by a 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 engine producing 315 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque.
