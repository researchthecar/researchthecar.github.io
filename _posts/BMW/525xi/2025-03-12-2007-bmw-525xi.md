The 2007 BMW 525xi is an all-wheel-drive variant of the E60 5-Series, known for its blend of luxury, performance, and handling. Besides the 3.0L inline-6 engine in the 525xi (215 hp and 185 lb-ft of torque), the 2007 5-Series also came with a 3.0L inline-6 in the 530xi (255hp and 220 lb-ft of torque), a 4.8L V8 in the 550i (360hp and 360 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0L inline-6 diesel in the 535d (265hp and 413 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the car's driving dynamics, comfortable interior, and sophisticated styling. Common dislikes include higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles and potential for electrical issues.
