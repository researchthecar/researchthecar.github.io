**Summary**

The 2014 BMW 650i xDrive Gran Coupe, while offering a luxurious driving experience, is prone to several common issues, especially as it ages. The engine is susceptible to oil and coolant leaks, and higher than average oil consumption. The transmission can experience valve body and mechatronic unit problems leading to rough shifting. The suspension system can suffer from air suspension and adaptive damper failures. Electrical gremlins, like battery drain and iDrive malfunctions, are also common. Interior issues include seat motor failures. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from moderate (electrical glitches, seat motors) to severe (engine issues, transmission problems). The cost to repair can be substantial, particularly for engine, transmission, and suspension-related problems, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection crucial.
