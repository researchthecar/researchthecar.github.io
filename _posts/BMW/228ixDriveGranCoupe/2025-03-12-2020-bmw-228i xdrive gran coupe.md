The 2020 BMW 228i xDrive Gran Coupe is a stylish and sporty entry-level luxury vehicle. It's powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The all-wheel-drive system (xDrive) provides enhanced traction and stability. Owners often praise its sleek design, nimble handling, and comfortable interior. However, some common criticisms include limited rear passenger space and a firm ride. The 2020 BMW 228i xDrive Gran Coupe only comes with the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine option, so there are no other engine options available. The 8-speed automatic is also the only transmission option.
