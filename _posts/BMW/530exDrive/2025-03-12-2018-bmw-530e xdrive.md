The 2018 BMW 530e xDrive is a plug-in hybrid variant of the G30 5 Series, offering a blend of efficiency and performance. It combines a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 248 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. The engine is mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options for the 2018 5 Series include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6, and a 4.4-liter turbocharged V8, but the 530e xDrive is exclusively equipped with the hybrid powertrain.
