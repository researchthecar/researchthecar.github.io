The 2021 BMW X4 is a sporty coupe-like SUV that offers a blend of style, performance, and practicality. Engine options include the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque (X4 xDrive30i) and the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 producing 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque (X4 M40i).
