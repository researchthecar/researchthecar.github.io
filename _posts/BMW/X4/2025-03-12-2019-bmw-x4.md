The 2019 BMW X4 is a sporty crossover coupe offering a blend of style and performance. It comes with two primary engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 and a 3.0L turbocharged inline-6. The 2.0L engine produces around 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, providing adequate power for daily driving. The more powerful 3.0L engine generates approximately 355 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque, offering significantly quicker acceleration and a more engaging driving experience. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the X4's distinctive styling, agile handling, and upscale interior. Common criticisms include the compromised rear visibility due to the sloping roofline and the higher price compared to more traditional SUVs.
