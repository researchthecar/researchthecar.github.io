The 2022 BMW X4 is a stylish and sporty coupe SUV that blends the practicality of an SUV with the sleek lines of a coupe. Engine options for the 2022 X4 include the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (248 hp, 258 lb-ft of torque) in the X4 xDrive30i and the more powerful 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (382 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque) in the X4 M40i. The X4 is praised for its agile handling, powerful engines, and luxurious interior. However, some owners have criticized its compromised rear headroom and cargo space compared to the more traditional X3 SUV, as well as its firm ride and higher price tag. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.
