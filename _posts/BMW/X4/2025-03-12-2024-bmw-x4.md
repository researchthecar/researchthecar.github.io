The 2024 BMW X4 is a sporty coupe-styled SUV offering a blend of performance and practicality. Engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, standard in the X4 xDrive30i, and a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six generating 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque in the M40i. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the X4's athletic handling, distinctive styling, and upscale interior. Common dislikes include the compromised rear visibility and limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline, as well as the higher price point compared to more traditional SUVs.
