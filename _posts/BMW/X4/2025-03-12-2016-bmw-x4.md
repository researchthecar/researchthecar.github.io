Okay, here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2016 BMW X4, organized by category and specific configurations where applicable.

The 2016 BMW X4 is a compact luxury crossover coupe, known for its sporty handling and distinctive styling. It came with a couple engine options; a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (240 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque) in the xDrive28i trim and a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (355 hp, 343 lb-ft of torque) in the xDrive35i trim. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the X4 for its agile driving dynamics and upscale interior. Some criticisms included the limited rear headroom and cargo space due to the sloping roofline, as well as the relatively firm ride.
