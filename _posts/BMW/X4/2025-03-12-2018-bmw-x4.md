The 2018 BMW X4 is a sporty crossover coupe that blends the practicality of an SUV with the styling of a coupe. Engine options for the 2018 X4 included a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (xDrive28i) producing 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six (xDrive35i/M40i) delivering 355 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque (M40i).
