### Summary Verdict
The 2017 BMW X4 offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly concerning its powertrain and chassis components. The 8-speed automatic transmission is a strong performer with no significant widespread issues. While the engines are robust, owners should be aware of potential coolant leaks and turbocharger concerns on the 2.0L, and oil leaks or PCV issues on the 3.0L, though these are not universally reported. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive system glitches and intermittent battery drain, are the most commonly cited issues beyond typical wear. Overall, the X4 is a well-built vehicle, but proactive maintenance and awareness of these specific potential issues will contribute to a more positive ownership experience.
