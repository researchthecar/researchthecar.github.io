The 2015 BMW X4 is a compact luxury crossover coupe that blends the practicality of an SUV with the sporty styling of a coupe. Engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (28i models) producing 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six (35i models) generating 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. All models are equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive (xDrive). Owners generally praise the X4 for its engaging driving dynamics, stylish design, and comfortable interior. Common complaints include the limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline, the firm ride, and the higher price compared to more traditionally shaped SUVs.
