### Summary Verdict
The 2011 BMW 335i xDrive offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury. Its primary reliability concerns revolve around the turbocharged inline-six engines, particularly the N54, which can experience issues with fuel injectors, wastegates, and the cooling system (water pump/thermostat). The N55 engine shares some of these concerns. Automatic transmission models may face issues with the mechatronic unit or torque converter. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear over time, and electrical gremlins, such as Idrive controller malfunctions, are not uncommon. While not inherently unreliable, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and factor in potential repair costs, especially for higher-mileage examples. Regular maintenance and addressing issues promptly are key to maintaining this performance sedan.
