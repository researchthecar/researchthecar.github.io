The 2022 BMW M235i xDrive Gran Coupe is a sporty and stylish four-door coupe offering a blend of performance and practicality. It comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 301 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the M235i for its agile handling, quick acceleration, and attractive design. Common complaints include a firm ride quality, limited rear passenger space, and some find the engine sound to be somewhat artificial.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (B48)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can sometimes be accompanied by a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection is recommended. Potential fixes range from replacing valve stem seals to more extensive engine work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and required repair.

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Aisin)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifts, particularly during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. This is most commonly reported in the first few gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In other cases, replacement of the valve body may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 for software update, $1,500 - $3,000+ for valve body replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system may intermittently freeze, lag, or spontaneously reboot while driving. This can affect navigation, audio, and other system functions.
    *   Solution: Try restarting the iDrive system. If the problem persists, a software update from the dealership may be needed. In rare cases, the infotainment system module itself may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update, $500 - $2,000+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a day after running the vehicle. This results in the car not starting.
    * Solution: Replace the battery if it's old and not holding charge. Ensure all modules are properly shut down after turning off the engine. If the parasitic drain is excessive, a dealer inspection is recommended. Potential fixes range from replacing faulty relays to more extensive electrical work.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the cause and required repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Premature Brake Rotor Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners in areas with heavy salt usage during winter have reported excessive corrosion on the brake rotors. This can lead to reduced braking performance and noise.
    *   Solution: Regular cleaning and inspection of brake rotors, especially after exposure to salt. Replacement of rotors may be necessary if corrosion is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for rotor replacement per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattling noises emanating from the dashboard or trim panels, particularly on rough roads.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per damper, depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 BMW M235i xDrive Gran Coupe appears to have a mix of minor and potentially more significant issues. The excessive oil consumption and potential for transmission problems are perhaps the most concerning, as they could lead to costly repairs. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and battery drain also appear with some frequency.
