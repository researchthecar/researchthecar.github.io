### Summary Verdict
The 2015 BMW Alpina B7L demonstrates a strong reliability record, particularly in its core powertrain components. The 4.4L twin-turbo V8 and the 8-speed automatic transmission are generally robust. Potential areas of concern, as with many vehicles of this era and complexity, lie in the advanced suspension system, specifically air spring leaks or compressor issues, and certain electrical components like the iDrive system or parasitic battery drains. Interior climate control actuators can also be a point of failure. While these issues are not universally reported, they represent the most common non-wear-and-tear problems. Overall, the B7L offers a reliable luxury performance experience, but owners should budget for potential maintenance on its sophisticated systems.
