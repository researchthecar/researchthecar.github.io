The 2014 BMW Alpina B7L is a high-performance luxury sedan, known for its blend of comfort, power, and exclusivity. Alpina enhances the standard BMW 7 Series with unique styling, upgraded performance, and handcrafted details. Under the hood sits a modified version of BMW's 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine. This engine produces around 540 horsepower and 540 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the B7L's luxurious interior, smooth ride, and impressive acceleration, while potential downsides include higher maintenance costs compared to a standard 7 Series and potential complexity of the specialized Alpina components.
