The 2015 BMW Alpina B7L is a high-performance luxury sedan that combines the comfort and refinement of the BMW 7 Series with the enhanced performance and unique styling touches of Alpina. It was offered with a single engine option: a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 540 horsepower and 540 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission choice was an 8-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the B7L for its exceptional power, comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and distinctive appearance. Criticisms often center around its high price point, complex electronics that can be prone to issues, and the higher running costs associated with a performance-oriented vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2015 BMW Alpina B7L, while a fantastic performance sedan, is not without its potential issues. Engine and transmission problems can be relatively costly to repair, and the air suspension system is another area prone to issues. Electrical gremlins are also common, and diagnosis can be time-consuming and therefore expensive. The overall severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to significant mechanical problems. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance and repair costs compared to non-performance luxury sedans. The most common issues are oil leaks, coolant leaks, suspension issues, and electrical issues.
