# 2020 BMW i3s

### Overview
The 2020 BMW i3s is an all-electric compact car that offers a unique blend of urban agility and premium features. As an electric vehicle, its powertrain is fundamentally different from traditional internal combustion engine cars, leading to a distinct set of potential reliability considerations. The i3s is known for its innovative construction, including a carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) passenger cell and an aluminum drive module. This design choice impacts its repairability and the types of issues that might arise. Overall, the i3s has demonstrated a generally positive reliability record, particularly in its core electric drivetrain, though like any vehicle, it is not immune to specific component concerns.

### Summary Verdict
The 2020 BMW i3s generally exhibits good reliability, especially concerning its electric drivetrain. The primary concerns revolve around the longevity and potential cost of the high-voltage battery pack, though this is often mitigated by warranty coverage. The optional range extender, being a small gasoline engine, introduces more traditional automotive issues like fuel pump problems and general malfunctions, but these are less common as many i3s are purely electric. Electrical components, particularly the 12V auxiliary battery and infotainment system software, can occasionally present minor issues. Exterior and interior components are largely robust, with isolated reports of lighting or climate control module failures. Overall, for an electric vehicle of its era, the i3s is a solid choice with manageable reliability expectations.
