The 2019 BMW i3s is a quirky and unique electric vehicle known for its distinctive styling, carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) construction, and agile handling. The "s" variant offers a sportier suspension, wider track, and more powerful electric motor compared to the standard i3. The 2019 i3s features a single electric motor that produces 181 horsepower and 199 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the i3s's quick acceleration, eco-friendliness, and futuristic design. However, common criticisms include limited range (though improved in later model years), a firm ride (especially on the "s" model), and the unconventional interior design, including the rear-hinged "suicide" doors. Some also find the pricing high compared to other electric vehicles with similar range.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor (181 hp)**

*   **Reduced Drive Power Warning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report receiving a "Reduced Drive Power" warning on the dashboard, accompanied by a noticeable decrease in acceleration and overall performance. This can sometimes occur intermittently.
    *   Solution: The issue can sometimes be caused by a faulty high-voltage battery pack. The high-voltage battery pack may need to be replaced. In addition, the charging system should be checked and software updates should be applied.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000 - $20,000+ (battery replacement), $100 - $300 (software updates).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Electric Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In rare cases, the electric motor itself can fail, leading to complete loss of propulsion.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the electric motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners, particularly those in areas with rough roads, have reported premature wear of the shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride. This seems more prevalent on the "s" model due to its stiffer suspension setup.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+ (for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery can drain prematurely, leading to starting issues or requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Possible replacement of the 12V battery. Further investigation may be needed to identify any parasitic drain on the system if the issue persists after battery replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the charging system, including the onboard charger or the charging port, can prevent the car from charging properly. Symptoms include slow charging, failure to charge, or error messages during charging.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the charging system to identify the faulty component, followed by replacement or repair. This could involve the onboard charger, charging port, or associated wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Struts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The gas struts that support the rear hatch can weaken over time, causing the hatch to droop or fail to stay open.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear hatch struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **iDrive System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can experience occasional glitches, such as freezing, lagging, or unresponsive controls.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In more severe cases, replacement of the iDrive module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (software updates), $800 - $1,500+ (iDrive module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat occupancy sensor in the passenger seat can malfunction, causing the airbag warning light to illuminate or preventing the airbag from deploying correctly in an accident.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the seat occupancy sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 BMW i3s, while a unique and enjoyable EV, can be prone to certain issues. Electrical problems, particularly related to the high-voltage battery and charging system, can be significant and costly to repair. Suspension issues, especially premature shock wear, are also common. Interior and exterior issues, while generally less severe, can still be frustrating. The cost of repairs can vary widely, with battery replacement being the most expensive potential repair. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and ensure a thorough pre-purchase inspection, especially focusing on the battery health and electrical system.
