### Summary Verdict
The 2018 BMW i3s demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly concerning its primary electric drivetrain. The electric motor and single-speed transmission are robust. The main areas of concern tend to be related to the high-voltage battery, which, while generally reliable, can be a significant expense if replacement is needed. Owners of the optional range extender should be aware of potential issues with the small gasoline engine, such as fuel system problems or warning lights. Electrical components like the 12V auxiliary battery and infotainment system can also experience failures. Exterior and interior components are largely free of widespread issues. Proactive maintenance and prompt attention to any warning lights are recommended.
