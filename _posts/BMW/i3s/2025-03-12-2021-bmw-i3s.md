The 2021 BMW i3s is a distinctive and quirky all-electric subcompact car, offering a unique blend of futuristic styling, agile handling, and eco-consciousness. The "s" variant boosts the standard i3's power output to 181 horsepower and 199 lb-ft of torque, offering slightly quicker acceleration and sportier driving dynamics. The i3s is solely available with a single-speed direct-drive transmission. Owners often praise its nimble handling, instant torque, and distinctive interior design. Criticisms often revolve around its limited range compared to newer EVs, polarizing exterior styling, and the firm ride, particularly on the "s" model. The following outlines common issues encountered by owners of the 2021 BMW i3s.

**Electric Motor**

*   **Drive Unit Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete loss of drive power, warning lights on the dashboard indicating an issue with the electric motor. The car may become immobile.

**Summary**

The 2021 BMW i3s generally experiences electrical issues, which can range from minor inconveniences to more serious problems affecting the vehicle's drivability. Drive unit failure can be the most expensive, while 12V battery issues are far less costly. As an all-electric vehicle, the battery system can also degrade and cause capacity loss. While some electrical issues can be relatively inexpensive to resolve, more complex problems can lead to significant repair bills. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic specializing in electric vehicles.
