Common dislikes include its relatively limited range compared to newer EVs, premium price point, and some compromises in ride comfort due to its narrow tires.

**Electric Motor**

**Single Electric Motor (181 hp, 199 lb-ft)**

*   **Reduced Power Output/ Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the vehicle entering a "turtle mode" or experiencing a significant reduction in power output, even with sufficient battery charge. This can happen intermittently and be accompanied by error messages on the dashboard related to the electric drive system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause can involve checking the high-voltage battery system, the electric motor itself, the power electronics, and related sensors. Software updates are often a first step. If hardware is faulty, the affected component (e.g., battery modules, motor components, or power inverter) would need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Repair costs can vary greatly depending on the cause and the specific component needing replacement. Battery-related issues may involve high costs, ranging from $5,000 - $15,000+, whereas issues with the motor or power electronics could be in the $2,000 - $8,000+ range.

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The i3s, like other EVs, relies on a 12V battery for certain functions like starting the car, running accessories, and maintaining system memory. Premature failure of this 12V battery has been reported, leading to issues like the car not starting, error messages, or accessories not functioning.
    *   Solution: Replacing the 12V battery is the typical solution. Ensure the replacement battery meets the BMW specifications for the i3s.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (including battery and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Port Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced problems with the charging port, including difficulty connecting the charger, failure to initiate charging, or error messages related to the charging process. This can be due to faulty charging port components or software glitches.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves inspecting the charging port for physical damage or debris, checking the charging cable, and updating the vehicle's software. Replacement of the charging port may be necessary if it is found to be defective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on the issue and necessary repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report premature wear of suspension bushings, particularly in the front control arms. Symptoms include clunking noises over bumps, imprecise steering, and uneven tire wear. This can be exacerbated by rough road conditions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings is the solution. Depending on the severity and location, the entire control arm may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm or bushing replacement, depending on the specific parts replaced and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **iDrive System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some users have reported occasional glitches with the iDrive infotainment system, including screen freezes, slow response times, and connectivity issues with Bluetooth devices or Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Often, a software update can resolve these glitches. In more severe cases, the iDrive control unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free at the dealership. Replacement of the iDrive control unit can cost $800 - $2,000+.

**Summary:**

While the 2022 BMW i3s is generally a reliable vehicle, some owners have reported issues with the electric motor, 12V battery, charging port, suspension bushings, and iDrive system. The severity and cost of repairs can vary, with potential for costly repairs related to the high-voltage battery system. The other issues are likely to be relatively inexpensive to repair. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
