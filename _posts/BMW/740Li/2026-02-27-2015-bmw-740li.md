### Summary Verdict
The 2015 BMW 740Li is a luxurious and generally reliable vehicle, particularly in its powertrain. The 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 engine, while powerful, can experience issues with the wastegate, PCV valve, and oil seals, which are common for turbocharged engines of this era. The 8-speed automatic transmission is robust. Potential concerns lie more with the complex electrical systems, including the iDrive infotainment and parasitic battery drain, and the adaptive suspension components like air springs. Interior features like HVAC blowers and power seat actuators can also require attention. Regular maintenance and prompt addressing of early symptoms are key to maintaining the 740Li's premium performance and comfort.
