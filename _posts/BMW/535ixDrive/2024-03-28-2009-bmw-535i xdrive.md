The 2009 BMW 535i xDrive is a luxury sedan powered by a 3.0L twin-turbocharged inline-6 engine paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. It delivers 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. With its sporty handling, spacious interior, and advanced technology, the 535i xDrive has been lauded for its performance and refinement. However, it has also been plagued by several issues.

**Engine**

* **N54 Engine:**
    * **Fuel Injector Failure:** Injectors fail, causing rough idling, poor performance, and increased fuel consumption.
    * **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure:** Pump fails, resulting in engine stalling and a lack of power.
    * **Turbocharger Wastegate Failure:** Wastegates malfunction, leading to reduced engine power and increased turbocharger wear.
    * **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** Gasket fails, causing oil seepage and potential engine damage.
* **N55 Engine (Optional):**
    * **Valve Stem Seal Leakage:** Seals leak, causing excessive oil consumption and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** Tensioner fails, resulting in a noisy engine and potential engine damage.

**Transmission**

* **6-Speed Automatic Transmission:**
    * **Torque Converter Shudder:** Transmission vibrates excessively during acceleration.
    * **Solenoid Failure:** Solenoids malfunction, causing shifting issues and poor transmission performance.
    * **Valve Body Failure:** Valve body fails, leading to erratic shifting and transmission failure.

**Suspension**

* **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure:** Bushes wear out, causing excessive play in the suspension and a decrease in handling precision.
* **Rear Subframe Cracking:** Subframe cracks, compromising the suspension geometry and potentially causing a loss of control.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Discharge:** Battery drains prematurely due to faulty parasitic draw.
* **Alternator Failure:** Alternator malfunctions, resulting in a lack of power and a discharged battery.
* **Electronic Control Module Failure:** Module fails, leading to various electrical issues and potential loss of vehicle functionality.

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation:** Headlights develop condensation, reducing visibility and potentially causing damage to the lighting system.
* **Tailgate Liftgate Failure:** Liftgate fails to open or close properly due to mechanical or electrical issues.

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** Climate control system fails to maintain desired temperature or airflow.
* **I-Drive System Issues:** I-Drive touchscreen experiences intermittent issues or complete failure.
* **Door Lock Malfunction:** Door locks fail to function properly, leading to security concerns.

**Summary:**

The 2009 BMW 535i xDrive offers impressive performance and luxury, but its reliability has been marred by a range of issues, particularly in the engine, transmission, and suspension. Some of these issues can be costly to repair, potentially impacting the overall value and ownership experience of the vehicle.
