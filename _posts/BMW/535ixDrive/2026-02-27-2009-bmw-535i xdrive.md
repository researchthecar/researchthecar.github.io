### Summary Verdict
The 2009 BMW 535i xDrive offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential buyers should be prepared for some common issues, particularly with its potent N54 twin-turbocharged engine. Key areas to monitor include the fuel system (injectors, HPFP), turbocharger components, and the cooling system. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive glitches and window regulator failures, are also not uncommon. While the transmission and suspension are generally robust, the complexity of the engine and electronics can lead to significant repair costs if not maintained proactively. Thorough pre-purchase inspections and a history of diligent maintenance are highly recommended for this model.
