The 2009 BMW 535i xDrive is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its blend of performance and comfort. The xDrive denotes that it is all-wheel drive. The 535i models were offered with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (N54) producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. The 2009 528i had a 230-hp 3.0 liter inline-6, and the 550i had a 360-hp 4.8 liter V8. The 535i xDrive was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's handling, powerful engine (especially the 535i), and luxurious interior. However, common complaints include high maintenance costs, electrical issues, and problems related to the N54 engine's turbocharging system.
