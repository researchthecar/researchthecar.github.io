The 2016 BMW 120i is a sporty and efficient hatchback that's part of the F20 generation. The model you're asking about, the 120i, is typically equipped with a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine (B48 engine) producing around 177 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2016 1 Series range included the 116i (less powerful petrol), 118i (another petrol option), 125i (more powerful petrol), and diesel variants like the 116d, 118d, and 120d. Transmission choices usually consist of a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the 120i for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and premium interior feel. Common dislikes include the relatively small rear passenger space and the potential for higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles.

**Summary:**

The 2016 BMW 120i, while a well-regarded vehicle, has its share of common issues. Engine oil and coolant leaks, particularly from plastic parts, are concerns. The 8-speed automatic transmission can exhibit rough shifting. Suspension components, especially the lower control arm bushings, are prone to wear. Electrical problems, such as faulty parking sensors and iDrive glitches, can also occur. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission or iDrive unit replacements, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly or prioritize a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
