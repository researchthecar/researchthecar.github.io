# 2010 BMW 120i

### Overview
The 2010 BMW 120i, part of the E87 generation, is generally considered a solid vehicle with a focus on driving dynamics. It typically came equipped with a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter inline-four engine, known for its smooth operation and decent fuel economy. Transmission options usually included a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. While BMWs are premium vehicles and may have higher maintenance costs than some competitors, the 120i from this era doesn't suffer from widespread, catastrophic failures. Common areas to inspect, as with many vehicles of this age, include typical wear items and the electrical system, but overall reliability is respectable for its class and performance orientation.
