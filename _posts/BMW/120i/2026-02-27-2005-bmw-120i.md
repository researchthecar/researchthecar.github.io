### Summary Verdict
The 2005 BMW 120i (E87) presents a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly with its manual transmission. However, common issues tend to emerge with age, primarily concerning the engine's oil management systems (PCV, gaskets) and the timing chain, which can be costly to address. Automatic transmissions may require attention to the mechatronic unit or torque converter. Suspension components like control arm bushings and rear shocks are also noted wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and ABS modules, can occur. Interior displays may suffer from pixel degradation. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the longevity and reliability of this model.
