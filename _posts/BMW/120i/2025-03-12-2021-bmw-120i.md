The 2021 BMW 120i is a premium compact hatchback offering a blend of sporty handling and luxurious features. In addition to the 120i, engine options in the 1 Series range include the 118i, 128ti, and the M135i xDrive. The 120i features a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 178 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Typically, this engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, although some markets may have offered a manual option. Drivers generally appreciate the 120i for its responsive handling, well-appointed interior, and efficient engine. Criticisms often revolve around the higher price point compared to competitors, limited rear passenger space, and some of the features only being available as optional extras.
