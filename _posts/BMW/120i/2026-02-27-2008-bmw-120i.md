### Summary Verdict
The 2008 BMW 120i offers an engaging driving experience but, like many premium vehicles of its era, can present specific reliability concerns. Common issues tend to revolve around oil and coolant leaks from the engine, potential VANOS system problems, and wear on transmission components, particularly the automatic gearbox's mechatronic unit and torque converter. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks are also areas to monitor for wear. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and ABS sensors, can occur. While the exterior is generally robust, interior electronics like HVAC resistors and display screens may require attention. Regular maintenance and prompt addressing of early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the 120i's reliability and driving pleasure.
