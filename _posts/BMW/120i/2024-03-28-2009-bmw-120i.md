However, like any vehicle, it has its share of issues that owners have reported.

**Engine**
**2.0L N46B20**

* **Oil leaks:** The valve cover gasket or oil filter housing gasket may develop leaks, causing oil to drip onto the engine or ground. Symptoms include a burning smell, reduced oil levels, or visible oil spots. The fix involves replacing the faulty gasket, which typically costs $200 - $400.
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** In some cases, the timing chain tensioner may fail, causing the timing chain to skip or break. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, reduced engine power, or potential catastrophic engine failure. The solution is to replace the timing chain, tensioner, and related components, which can cost $2,000 - $4,000+.
* **VANOS system issues:** The Variable Valve Timing (VANOS) system may experience failures, leading to reduced engine performance, rough idling, or increased fuel consumption. Symptoms can include engine warning lights, hesitation during acceleration, or poor fuel economy. The fix involves replacing faulty VANOS components or reprogramming the engine control unit, which can cost $500 - $1,500+.

**Transmission**
**6-speed manual**

* **Gearbox oil leaks:** The transmission may develop leaks from seals or gaskets, allowing gearbox oil to escape. Symptoms include low transmission fluid levels, difficulty shifting gears, or visible oil stains under the vehicle. The solution is to replace the faulty seals or gaskets, which typically costs $200 - $500.
* **Clutch issues:** The clutch may wear out prematurely or experience other issues, leading to slipping, difficulty engaging gears, or vibrations. Symptoms include a burning smell, difficulty shifting gears, or excessive clutch pedal travel. The fix involves replacing the clutch, which can cost $1,000 - $2,000+.

**6-speed automatic**

* **Mechatronic unit failure:** The mechatronic unit, which controls the automatic transmission, may malfunction, causing transmission issues. Symptoms can include rough shifting, delayed gear changes, or transmission warning lights. The solution is to replace the mechatronic unit, which can cost $2,000 - $4,000+.
* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter may experience shuddering or vibrations during acceleration or gear changes. Symptoms include a noticeable vibration felt through the vehicle. The fix involves replacing the torque converter, which can cost $1,500 - $2,500+.

**Suspension**

* **Front strut mount failure:** The front strut mounts may wear out prematurely, causing noises or vibrations during suspension movement. Symptoms include a clunking or rattling sound when driving over bumps or a vibration felt through the steering wheel. The fix involves replacing the strut mounts, which typically costs $500 - $1,000+.
* **Rear shock absorber failure:** The rear shock absorbers may fail, leading to a rough ride or reduced handling capabilities. Symptoms include excessive bouncing or swaying, especially over uneven roads. The fix is to replace the shock absorbers, which can cost $500 - $1,000+.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator may fail, resulting in a loss of electrical power. Symptoms include dimming lights, malfunctioning electrical components, or a difficulty starting the vehicle. The fix involves replacing the alternator, which typically costs $500 - $1,000+.
* **Battery discharge:** The battery may experience premature discharge or fail to hold a charge. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle, electrical system malfunctions, or a warning light on the dashboard. The fix involves replacing the battery, which typically costs $200 - $400.

**Exterior**

* **Door lock actuator failure:** The door lock actuators may fail, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking properly. Symptoms include difficulty locking or unlocking doors, or the doors may lock or unlock intermittently. The fix involves replacing the faulty actuator, which typically costs $200 - $500+.
* **Plastic trim panel fading:** Some exterior plastic trim panels may fade or discolor over time, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight. Symptoms include a faded or discolored appearance of the trim pieces. The fix involves replacing the faded panels, which can cost $100 - $300+.

**Interior**

* **Climate control system failure:** The climate control system may experience malfunctions, such as inconsistent temperature regulation or fan speed issues. Symptoms can include difficulty controlling the temperature inside the vehicle or a noisy fan. The fix involves diagnosing and repairing the faulty component, which can vary in cost depending on the issue.
* **Heated seat element failure:** The heated seat elements may fail, preventing the seats from warming up properly. Symptoms include a lack of heat when the heated seats are turned on. The fix involves replacing the faulty heating element, which typically costs $200 - $400+.

**Summary**

The 2009 BMW 120i generally has a good reliability record, but it is not immune to certain issues that have been reported by owners. The most common problems include oil leaks, timing chain issues, and transmission issues. Electrical and suspension problems have also been reported, but to a lesser extent. The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the specific problem encountered. Regular maintenance and addressing issues promptly can help prevent more costly repairs in the long run.
