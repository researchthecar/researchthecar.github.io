**Summary**

The 2009 BMW 120i, while praised for its driving dynamics, can present owners with several potential issues. Engine problems, particularly related to the timing chain and VANOS system in the N43 engine, are relatively common and can be costly to repair. Automatic transmission issues, mainly the mechatronic unit and valve body, are another area of concern. Suspension issues, like worn bushings, can affect handling and ride comfort. Electrical problems, such as battery drain, add to the maintenance burden. While some issues are minor, others can result in significant repair expenses. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, review its maintenance history, and be prepared for the possibility of higher maintenance costs associated with a European car.
