### Summary Verdict
The 2016 BMW 120i demonstrates good overall reliability, with the most commonly cited non-wear-and-tear issues revolving around the engine's ancillary components like the PCV valve and turbocharger, and potential electrical issues such as water pump failure. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, while generally robust, can occasionally suffer from mechatronics unit problems. The manual transmission and other systems like suspension, exterior, and interior components are typically free from widespread significant faults. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early warning signs are key to ensuring long-term dependability for this model.
