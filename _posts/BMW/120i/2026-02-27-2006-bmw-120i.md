### Summary Verdict
The 2006 BMW 120i offers a compelling blend of performance and practicality. While generally reliable, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as oil leaks from the valve cover gasket, potential oil consumption in the N46 engine, and wear on suspension components like control arm bushings. Automatic transmission owners might face issues with the mechatronic unit or torque converter. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and ABS sensors can also arise. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning fluid levels and regular inspections, is key to ensuring long-term dependability. Despite these potential points of concern, the 120i remains a desirable car for enthusiasts when well-maintained.
