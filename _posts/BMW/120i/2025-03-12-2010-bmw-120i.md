The 2010 BMW 120i is a rear-wheel-drive compact car known for its sporty handling and upscale features. In the Australian market, where the 120i was commonly sold, it was available with a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 engine (N43B20 or N46B20 depending on specific production date and market). This engine produced around 115-125 kW (156-170 hp) and 200-210 Nm of torque. Other engine options for the 2010 1 Series included the 118i with a less powerful version of the same 2.0-liter, the 125i with a 3.0-liter inline-6, and the diesel-powered 118d, 120d, and 123d models. Transmission choices typically included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Drivers often appreciate the 120i's responsive steering and engaging driving experience, while common complaints often revolve around higher running costs, potential for expensive repairs, and relatively firm ride quality.
