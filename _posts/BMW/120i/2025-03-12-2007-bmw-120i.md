The 2007 BMW 120i is a compact hatchback known for its sporty handling and premium feel. In addition to the 2.0L N46B20 inline-4 engine which produces approximately 129-150 horsepower (depending on the market and tune) and around 136-148 lb-ft of torque, other engine options included the 1.6L N43B16 inline-4 gasoline engine, the 2.0L N43B20 inline-4 gasoline engine, the 3.0L N52B30 inline-6 gasoline engine, and the 2.0L M47D20 inline-4 diesel engine. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners typically appreciate the 120i's driving dynamics and relatively fuel-efficient engines, but common complaints include relatively high maintenance costs and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**N46B20 (2.0L Inline-4 Gasoline)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often originating from the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, or the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine or garage floor, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty gasket(s) is the typical solution. Cleaning the affected area is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the location of the leak and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VANOS (Variable Nockenwellen Steuerung) system controls valve timing. Solenoid failures can lead to rough idling, poor performance, reduced fuel economy, and the engine management light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty VANOS solenoid(s) and potentially cleaning the VANOS system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+, depending on labor rates and whether one or both solenoids need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The N46 engine has been known to have timing chain issues, especially with wear/stretch. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine (especially on startup), misfires, and potential engine damage if left unresolved.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides. It's often recommended to replace related components like sprockets at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+, depending on labor rates and parts replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**M47D20 (2.0L Inline-4 Diesel)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can fail due to excessive wear, oil starvation, or damage from foreign objects. Symptoms include a loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and a whistling or whining noise from the turbo.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger. Inspecting and cleaning the oil feed lines and intercooler is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+, depending on labor rates and whether a new or remanufactured turbo is used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Swirl Flap Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Swirl flaps in the intake manifold can become loose or break, causing engine damage. Symptoms include rough running, poor performance, and potentially a metallic rattling noise.
    *   Solution: Removing the swirl flaps entirely and installing blanking plates, or replacing the entire intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+, depending on the solution and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**N52B30 (3.0L Inline-6 Gasoline)**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the N46, the valve cover gasket is a common source of oil leaks. Symptoms are the same, including visible leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+, depending on labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as with the N46, VANOS solenoid failures can cause rough idling, poor performance, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty VANOS solenoid(s) and potentially cleaning the VANOS system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+, depending on labor rates and whether one or both solenoids need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Both 6-Speed Manual and 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Clutch Issues (Manual Transmission Only)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, and a high clutch pedal engagement point.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+, depending on labor rates and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping (Automatic Transmission Only)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting, jerky shifts, or slipping between gears. Can sometimes be accompanied by warning lights.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid flush and filter change can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid/filter) to $3000+ (rebuild/replacement), depending on the severity and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can also cause vague steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings. It's often recommended to replace the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side, depending on labor rates and whether only the bushings or the entire control arm is replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn shock absorbers/struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per axle, depending on labor rates and the type of shocks/struts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows that are slow to operate, stop working entirely, or make grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window regulator.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illumination, traction control light illumination, and potentially reduced braking performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ABS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+, depending on labor rates and the sensor location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on body panels, especially around wheel arches, door edges, and underneath the car.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including removing the rust, applying rust inhibitor, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200+ per area, depending on the severity and extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticking Door Locks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty locking or unlocking the doors, or doors that don't lock/unlock with the remote.
    *   Solution: Replacing the door lock actuator.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Airbag Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag light constantly illuminated on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the airbag light (often a faulty seat occupancy sensor, clock spring, or wiring issue) and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on the cause and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 BMW 120i can be a fun and engaging car to drive, but potential owners should be aware of the common issues. Engine-related problems like oil leaks, VANOS solenoid failures, and timing chain issues on the N46 engines, swirl flap issues on the M47 diesel, and valve cover gasket leaks on the N52 can lead to significant repair bills. Suspension problems like worn bushings and shocks are also common. Electrical issues like faulty window regulators and ABS sensors can also add to the cost of ownership. While some issues can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like engine repairs or transmission rebuilds, can be quite costly. Overall, the 2007 120i requires careful inspection and a proactive maintenance approach to avoid major expenses.
