### Summary Verdict
The 2007 BMW 530xi offers a compelling package for those seeking a premium all-wheel-drive sedan. Its N52 inline-six engine is generally robust, but common issues like valve cover gasket leaks and PCV system failures require attention. The automatic transmission, while smooth, can experience leaks or mechatronic unit problems. Suspension components, particularly control arm bushings and strut mounts, are known to wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or accessory failures like headlight ballasts, can be frustrating. Interior issues like iDrive glitches and sunroof drain clogs are also noted. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the 530xi to be a rewarding vehicle when properly maintained, with repair costs being typical for a luxury European car of this era.
