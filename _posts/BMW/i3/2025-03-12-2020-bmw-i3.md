The 2020 BMW i3 is a distinctive and quirky electric hatchback known for its innovative use of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) in its construction, giving it a light curb weight and unique aesthetic. The i3 features a single electric motor that delivers a peppy driving experience. The standard i3 produced 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, while the i3s variant bumped that up to 181 horsepower and 199 lb-ft of torque. Some owners love the i3 for its nimble handling, spacious interior (for its size), and futuristic design. Downsides often cited include limited range compared to newer EVs, polarizing styling, and relatively high price point for its size. A range-extender (REX) model, which included a small gasoline engine to act as a generator, was also available. However, this will not be accounted for in the following report as it is less common.

**Electric Motor**

**i3/i3s Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle enters "Turtle Mode," severely limiting power and speed. This can be accompanied by a warning light indicating reduced drivetrain power. Often caused by software glitches or battery management system (BMS) issues.
    *   Solution: Software update at the dealership to address BMS glitches. Check 12v battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $300+ (depending on warranty coverage and diagnostic time)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Voltage Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable reduction in driving range over time. This is a natural occurrence in all EVs, but some owners have reported faster-than-expected degradation, especially in early models.
    *   Solution: While the battery has a warranty (typically 8 years/100,000 miles), significant degradation needs to be demonstrated to qualify for replacement or repair. Monitoring battery health through the car's diagnostics or third-party apps is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement outside of warranty can be $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can also lead to vague steering feel. The issue often arises from the front lower control arm bushings or rear trailing arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings or the entire control arm. Aftermarket polyurethane bushings are available as an upgrade for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per corner, depending on whether only bushings are replaced or the entire arm, and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to charge at certain charging stations (especially Level 2), error messages during charging, or slow charging speeds. This can be caused by issues with the car's onboard charger, the charging port, or the charging station itself.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the problem. Try different charging stations to rule out station issues. Check the car's charging port for debris or damage. If the onboard charger is faulty, it needs to be replaced. Software updates may also resolve some charging glitches.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+ depending on the component needing replacement (charging port vs. onboard charger).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The i3 relies on a traditional 12V battery to power auxiliary systems (lights, radio, etc.). Owners have reported premature failure of the 12V battery, leading to issues like the car not starting or electrical malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Regular testing and replacement of the 12V battery as needed. Ensure the replacement battery is properly coded to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ for battery replacement and coding.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tail Light Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: LED tail lights failing, either partially or completely. This is a common issue across many BMW models with LED lighting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire tail light assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per tail light assembly.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **iDrive System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or unexpected reboots of the iDrive infotainment system. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates are the primary fix. If the problem persists, the iDrive control unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1200+ depending on whether a software update resolves the issue or if hardware replacement is necessary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 BMW i3 is a unique electric vehicle with a few common issues. Electrical problems (charging issues, 12V battery failures) and suspension bushing wear are relatively common and can range in cost from a few hundred dollars to over a thousand. High voltage battery degradation is a concern for any EV, and while it's not necessarily a widespread problem for the 2020 i3, it's something potential buyers should be aware of. The severity of these issues varies, but overall, most are manageable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
