The 2019 BMW i3 is a unique electric vehicle known for its distinctive styling, agile handling, and use of lightweight materials like carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) in its construction. The standard i3 features a fully electric powertrain, while the i3 with Range Extender (REx) adds a small gasoline engine to act as a generator, extending the car's range. The electric motor in the 2019 i3 produces around 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, offering quick acceleration and a fun driving experience in urban environments. Some owners appreciate the i3 for its eco-friendliness, innovative design, and nimble handling. Common complaints include limited range (especially in the standard model), a firm ride, and polarizing styling. The REx model adds complexity and potential maintenance concerns related to the small gasoline engine, though the range is increased.

**Electric Motor**

**Standard Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Battery Capacity Over Time**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual reduction in battery capacity leading to shorter driving range compared to the initial range when new. This is a common issue in all electric vehicles as the battery degrades from use.
    *   Solution: Battery degradation is a normal process. Monitor battery health using the vehicle's computer. Replace the battery pack if capacity drops below an acceptable level.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $16,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Range Extender (REx) Engine**

**Range Extender Gasoline Engine**

*   **Range Extender Not Starting/Starting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The range extender engine fails to start when the battery reaches a low state of charge, or it starts with difficulty. This can be due to issues with the fuel system, ignition system, or the engine control unit.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the starting problem using diagnostic tools. Check the fuel pump, fuel filter, spark plugs, ignition coils, and engine control unit. Repair or replace faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the failed component
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Range Extender Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various engine seals and gaskets, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the oil leak. Replace the affected seals or gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rough Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The i3's suspension, while sporty, can feel firm and unforgiving, especially on rough roads. This is a general characteristic of the vehicle's design.
    *   Solution: There is no definitive fix for this. Ensure tire pressures are at the recommended levels. Consider aftermarket shocks or springs designed for improved comfort.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the 12V battery, leading to starting problems, error messages, and malfunctioning electrical components. The i3 relies on the 12V battery to boot up the computers that can then start the HV battery.
    *   Solution: Replace the 12V battery with a high-quality replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Software Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent software glitches affecting the infotainment system, navigation, and other electronic features.
    *   Solution: Check for available software updates and install them. If the problem persists, consult a BMW dealer for diagnosis and repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue) - $500+ (for more complex software repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Creaking/Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Creaking and rattling noises from various interior panels, especially in the dashboard and door panels.
    *   Solution: Locate the source of the noise and apply felt tape or foam padding to dampen the vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY) - $200+ (professional repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

No Issues Found

**Summary**

The 2019 BMW i3 can have issues with the electric motor that causes reduced range due to battery degradation. If equipped, the REx engine can have starting issues or oil leaks. Suspension problems are not that common but can have a rough ride quality. Electrical system issues may be caused by the 12V battery or software glitches. Interior trim pieces tend to rattle over time. The severity of the issues ranges from minor annoyances to more significant problems that could require costly repairs, particularly related to the battery or range extender engine. While the i3 is a unique and fun-to-drive EV, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
