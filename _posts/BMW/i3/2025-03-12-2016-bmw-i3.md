The 2016 BMW i3 is a quirky and innovative electric vehicle that offered a unique blend of efficiency and futuristic design. It came in two primary configurations: a pure electric vehicle (BEV) and a range-extended version (REx) that included a small gasoline engine acting as a generator. The BEV version produced around 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, offering brisk acceleration. Owners often praise the i3's agile handling, spacious interior for its size, and distinctive styling. Common complaints revolve around the limited range of the BEV version, the somewhat firm ride, and the unusual tire sizes, which can be expensive to replace. The REx version helps alleviate range anxiety but adds complexity and a distinct engine noise when the range extender kicks in.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor (BEV and REx)**

*   **Reduced Battery Capacity Over Time**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the high-voltage battery pack in the i3 can experience a reduction in its overall capacity. This manifests as a decrease in the vehicle's advertised range, even when fully charged. The degradation rate can vary depending on factors like climate, usage patterns, and charging habits.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis usually involves a battery capacity test at a BMW dealership. Replacing the battery pack is the primary solution for significant capacity loss. Software updates can sometimes help optimize battery management, but this will not physically restore capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000 - $20,000+ (Battery replacement is very expensive)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Occasional Motor Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the electric motor briefly stalling or hesitating during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like a momentary loss of power.
    *   Solution: The cause of this issue can vary, and diagnostics often involve checking the motor control module and related sensors. A software update might resolve the problem in some cases, but component replacement could be necessary in others.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Range Extender (REx)**

**Range Extender (Gasoline Engine Generator)**

*   **Range Extender Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The two-cylinder gasoline engine acting as a generator in the range-extended (REx) version can experience issues like rough running, misfires, or complete failure. This can be due to problems with the fuel injectors, ignition system, or other engine components. This is more common as the cars age.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves a thorough inspection of the engine, including fuel system, ignition system, and compression test. Repairs can range from replacing individual components to replacing the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Pump Failure (REx)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel pump that supplies fuel to the range extender engine can fail, causing the engine to not start or stall while driving. This is more common as the cars age.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, leading to clunking noises, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear. The front lower control arm bushings seem to be particularly vulnerable.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings or, in some cases, the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether bushings can be replaced separately from the control arm)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery that powers the car's electronics can be prone to draining, particularly if the car is left unused for extended periods. This can result in the car not starting or having various electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Jump-starting the car can temporarily solve the issue. However, diagnosing and addressing the underlying cause of the drain is essential. This may involve identifying parasitic draws or replacing the 12V battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on the cause of the drain and whether the battery needs to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The i3's navigation and infotainment system can experience glitches, such as screen freezes, slow response times, or software errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often the first step in addressing these issues. In some cases, replacing the head unit might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $2,000+ (depending on whether a software update fixes the issue or a new head unit is required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Port Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the charging port, including difficulty inserting or removing the charging cable, or the car not recognizing the charger.
    *   Solution: Inspection and cleaning of the charging port. Replacement of the charging port assembly may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Alignment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch of the i3 can sometimes have alignment issues, leading to difficulty closing it properly or wind noise.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the hatch hinges and latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof is known to have problems with the motor that opens and closes it. It can cause it to get stuck open or closed, or create excessive noise while operating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sunroof motor
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW i3, while innovative, has its share of potential issues. The most significant concern is the high cost of battery replacement if capacity degradation becomes excessive. REx models face potential engine issues as they age. Other electrical and suspension problems can also occur, adding to the overall cost of ownership. While many of these issues are not universally experienced, prospective buyers should be aware of them and factor them into their purchasing decision.
