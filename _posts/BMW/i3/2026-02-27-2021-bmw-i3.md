### Summary Verdict
The 2021 BMW i3 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core electric powertrain which has fewer mechanical components than traditional vehicles. The primary areas of concern are related to the high-voltage battery pack, where degradation over time can impact range, and potential issues with charging systems or the 12V auxiliary battery. Infotainment system glitches are also noted but are often resolvable with software updates. The suspension, exterior, and interior components generally perform well with no widespread reported failures. Prospective buyers should be aware of potential battery costs outside of warranty and ensure any used i3 has a healthy battery health report.
