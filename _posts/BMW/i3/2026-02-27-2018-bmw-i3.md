### Summary Verdict
The 2018 BMW i3 generally exhibits good reliability, particularly in its core electric powertrain. The electric motor and single-speed transmission have few documented widespread issues. The primary concerns tend to revolve around the high-voltage battery pack, specifically degradation over time which affects range, and potential charging system faults. The optional range extender, being a small internal combustion engine, is more susceptible to typical engine-related issues like warning lights and oil leaks. Electrical components, such as the 12V auxiliary battery and infotainment system software, can also present occasional problems. Overall, the i3 is a reliable choice for an EV, with most potential issues being manageable or covered under warranty for a period.
