The 2017 BMW i3 is a unique and innovative electric city car, known for its distinctive styling, lightweight carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) construction, and surprisingly engaging driving dynamics. It was offered with a fully electric powertrain, producing 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque.  Some models featured a range extender (REx), a small two-cylinder gasoline engine that doesn't directly power the wheels but acts as a generator to extend the car's driving range. The i3's compact size makes it ideal for urban environments, and its instant torque provides brisk acceleration.  However, some owners find the range limited compared to newer EVs, and the rear-hinged "coach" doors can be inconvenient in tight parking spaces.  The ride can also be firm due to the suspension tuning.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor (170 hp)**

*   **Reduced Propulsion Power**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported the car entering reduced power mode, often displayed as "Reduced Propulsion Power" or similar message on the dashboard. This can happen under various conditions, including hard acceleration or prolonged driving at higher speeds. The car's performance is significantly limited, and it may struggle to maintain speed. Some have reported seeing a drivetrain malfunction light illuminated.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause can be complex. Possible causes include issues with the high-voltage battery, the electric motor itself, or the power electronics. A BMW dealer or qualified EV technician should perform a thorough diagnostic scan. In some cases, it could be related to the charging system or a faulty sensor. Replacing the electric motor may be necessary if it is damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis $150 - $300+, Motor Replacement $8,000 - $12,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Voltage Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Like all electric vehicles, the i3's high-voltage battery experiences degradation over time, resulting in reduced range. The rate of degradation varies depending on usage patterns, charging habits, and environmental factors. Owners may notice a gradual decrease in the car's maximum range compared to when it was new.
    *   Solution: BMW offers a battery capacity check to assess the battery's health. In some cases, a software update can optimize battery management. If the battery has degraded significantly, replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery Capacity Test $100 - $200+, Battery Replacement $16,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Range Extender (REx) (Optional)**

*   **Range Extender (REx) Not Starting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Range Extender (REx) may fail to start when the battery reaches a low state of charge. This can leave the driver stranded with limited or no extended range. Common symptoms include the REx engine failing to turn over or starting and immediately stalling. A drivetrain malfunction light may also be displayed.
    *   Solution: Check the fuel level in the REx fuel tank, as it has a limited capacity. Inspect the fuel pump and fuel injectors for proper operation.  Faulty sensors or control modules related to the REx system can also prevent starting.  A diagnostic scan can help pinpoint the cause.  Replacement of the fuel pump or other components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fuel Pump Replacement $500 - $1000+, Sensor Replacement $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The fuel pump on the range extender engine can fail. This prevents the engine from starting or running properly. The vehicle may display a drivetrain malfunction light.
    * Solution: Replace the fuel pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the i3's rear dampers can fail prematurely, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride. This can occur due to the unique suspension design and the car's relatively light weight.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty dampers. It is recommended to replace them in pairs to maintain balanced handling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per pair
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Charging Port Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty charging the vehicle can arise from issues with the charging port, either at the vehicle or the charging station. Symptoms include the charging cable not locking properly, the car not recognizing the charging station, or intermittent charging.
    *   Solution: Inspect the charging port for damage or debris. Test with multiple charging stations and cables to isolate the issue. If the problem is with the vehicle's charging port, it may need to be repaired or replaced. A faulty charging module within the car can also cause charging problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Charging Port Repair $200 - $500+, Charging Module Replacement $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **12V Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery in the i3 can drain prematurely, leading to starting problems or electrical system malfunctions. This may be due to parasitic drain or a faulty battery.
    * Solution: Test the 12V battery's health and replace it if necessary. Investigate for any sources of parasitic drain and address them.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: 12V Battery Replacement $200 - $400+, Parasitic Drain Diagnosis $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can experience glitches, freezes, or slow response times. In some cases, the screen may go blank or the system may reboot unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Try restarting the iDrive system. If the problem persists, a software update may be available. In severe cases, the iDrive control unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update $0 - $200, iDrive Control Unit Replacement $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tail Light Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the LED tail lights can fail prematurely, requiring replacement.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty tail light assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2017 BMW i3, while an innovative and fun-to-drive EV, does have some common issues.  The most concerning are related to the electric motor and battery, which can be expensive to repair or replace. Range Extender models also have their own set of potential problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to charging and the iDrive system, can also be frustrating. Suspension issues can impact ride quality.  While some issues are relatively minor, the potential for high-cost repairs, especially concerning the high-voltage battery and electric motor, should be a consideration for prospective buyers.
