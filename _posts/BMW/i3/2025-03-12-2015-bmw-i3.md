The 2015 BMW i3 is a revolutionary electric vehicle with an optional range extender (REx) gasoline engine. The fully electric version delivers around 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, offering brisk acceleration and a unique driving experience. The REx model adds a 647cc two-cylinder gasoline engine acting solely as a generator to extend the driving range. People generally appreciate the i3 for its quirky styling, nimble handling, and eco-friendly nature. Common dislikes include limited range (especially in earlier models), a firm ride, and some unusual interior materials.
