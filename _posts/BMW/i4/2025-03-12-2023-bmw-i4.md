The 2023 BMW i4 is an all-electric gran coupe that blends performance and luxury. The model lineup includes the eDrive35, eDrive40, and the high-performance M50. The eDrive35 and eDrive40 models are rear-wheel drive, while the M50 is all-wheel drive. The eDrive35 delivers approximately 281 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The eDrive40 boasts around 335 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. The M50 variant significantly ups the ante with around 536 horsepower and 586 lb-ft of torque with Sport Boost engaged. Owners generally praise the i4 for its sleek design, engaging driving dynamics, and the smooth, quiet operation of its electric powertrain. Common criticisms include the somewhat firm ride quality, particularly on models with larger wheels and sport suspensions, and the complexity of the iDrive infotainment system, although BMW has been improving that.

The 2023 BMW i4 is generally considered a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it's not without its potential issues. The most common complaints revolve around the electrical system, particularly the iDrive infotainment system and potential battery drain. Some owners have also reported motor/power issues and charging issues. The interior rattling can be annoying, but is typically not a major mechanical problem. Repair costs can vary significantly, but electrical issues requiring module replacement can be expensive, while software updates are generally covered under warranty.
