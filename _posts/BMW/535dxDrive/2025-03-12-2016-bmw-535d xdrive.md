The 2016 BMW 535d xDrive is a popular luxury sedan known for its blend of performance, fuel efficiency, and comfort. The 535d is equipped with a 3.0-liter inline-six diesel engine producing 255 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2016 5 Series include various gasoline engines (528i, 535i, 550i). All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 535d for its strong acceleration, smooth ride, and upscale interior. However, some common complaints include the cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as potential issues with the emissions system on the diesel models.

**Engine**

**3.0L Inline-Six Diesel (N57)**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, warning lights on the dashboard, and a smell of burning from the exhaust. The DPF is designed to trap soot, but it can become clogged over time, especially with short trips or infrequent regeneration cycles.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF (can be done by a mechanic or sometimes initiated through the car's computer), cleaning the DPF, or replacement of the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ (depending on cleaning vs. replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and a sweet smell of coolant. The EGR cooler is responsible for cooling the exhaust gases before they are recirculated into the engine. Cracks can form, leading to coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **AdBlue (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights related to the AdBlue system, reduced engine power, and potential inability to start the engine. Problems can include a faulty AdBlue injector, pump, or level sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific component failure and replacement or repair as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1200+ (depending on the component).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Line Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, turbo lag, and potential fault codes related to boost pressure. The diesel engine relies on a complex vacuum system.
    *   Solution: Locating and replacing the damaged vacuum lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP45/70)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, and potential transmission fault codes. The valve body contains solenoids and valves that control the flow of transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. In some cases, flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter may help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to valve body issues, the mechatronic unit controls the shifting process and can cause erratic behavior or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially when accelerating, and potential torque converter lock-up issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting unevenly, compressor not functioning, and warning lights on the dashboard. Air springs can leak, and the compressor can fail.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air spring(s) and/or the air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per air spring; $600 - $1200+ for the compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially over bumps, and vague steering feel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car not starting after sitting for a short period, frequent jump starts required, and potential error messages related to low voltage.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic drain (often a faulty module or accessory) and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the cause).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Screen freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and navigation problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates, resetting the iDrive system, or replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software updates) - $2000+ (head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the door handles, particularly with the comfort access feature not working properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door handle assembly or related sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per door handle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof not opening or closing properly, excessive noise during operation, and potential leaks.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the sunroof motor, tracks, or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW 535d xDrive offers a compelling combination of performance and efficiency, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the diesel engine's emissions system (DPF, EGR cooler, AdBlue), the transmission, and electrical components. While some issues may be minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be costly, particularly those involving the transmission and emissions systems. Due to the complexity of the vehicle, a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic familiar with BMWs is highly recommended.
