The 2015 BMW 535d xDrive is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a blend of performance, fuel efficiency, and comfort. It's powered by a 3.0-liter inline-6 diesel engine producing 255 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options available for the 2015 5 Series included gasoline inline-4, inline-6, and V8 engines, as well as a hybrid option. What people generally like about the 535d is its strong torque delivery, fuel economy for its class, and comfortable ride. Common complaints revolve around the higher cost of diesel maintenance, potential diesel-specific issues, and some find the infotainment system a bit dated.

**Engine**

**3.0L Inline-6 Diesel (N57)**

*   **Failed Swirl Flap Actuator**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The swirl flaps in the intake manifold can become stuck or break, leading to a check engine light, rough idle, reduced performance, and potential engine damage if a flap breaks off and enters the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold assembly. Some owners opt to remove the swirl flaps entirely and install blanking plates, but this may affect emissions and is not legal in all areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged over time, especially with short trips and city driving, leading to reduced performance, increased fuel consumption, and a DPF warning light.
    *   Solution: Attempt a forced DPF regeneration using a diagnostic tool. If that fails, the DPF may need to be cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (cleaning) - $2000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Cooler Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the EGR cooler. Can cause coolant loss and overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar symptoms to compressor failure - sagging vehicle, especially overnight, air suspension warning light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air strut(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per strut

**Summary**

The 2015 BMW 535d xDrive can be a reliable vehicle, but it is important to be aware of the potential issues. Engine problems related to the diesel system (swirl flaps, DPF, EGR cooler) are common and can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues with the ZF 8HP transmission are also prevalent and can range from minor inconveniences to major failures. Electrical issues and sunroof problems can also occur. Regular maintenance, including oil changes, filter replacements, and software updates, is crucial to keeping the 535d xDrive in good condition. Due to the nature of diesel specific parts and luxury car repair, the cost of repairs can be on the higher end of the spectrum.
