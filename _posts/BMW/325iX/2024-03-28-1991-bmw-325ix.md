**Introduction:**

The 1991 BMW 325iX is a popular luxury sports sedan powered by a 2.5-liter inline-six engine that produces 168 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque. It came with a standard 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 4-speed automatic transmission. The 325iX is known for its precise handling, comfortable interior, and all-wheel-drive capability. However, it has its fair share of issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

* **M20B25 Inline-Six**
    * **Cylinder Head Gasket Failure:** This issue affects the earlier M20B25 engines. The gasket fails, causing coolant and oil to mix and leak. Symptoms include overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and low coolant levels. The solution is to replace the cylinder head gasket, which costs around $1,000 - $1,500+ to repair.
    * **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail on high-mileage engines, causing the timing chain to skip or break. Symptoms include rattling noises from the engine, reduced performance, and potential engine damage. Replacing the timing chain tensioner costs around $500 - $800+.
    * **Vacuum Leaks:** Vacuum leaks can occur in the intake manifold, hoses, or other components. Symptoms include rough idle, poor acceleration, and increased fuel consumption. The solution is to locate and seal the vacuum leak, which costs around $100 - $500+ to repair.

**Transmission**

* **Getrag 260 5-Speed Manual:**
    * **Synchronizer Wear:** The synchronizers in the transmission can wear out over time, causing difficulty shifting gears. Symptoms include grinding noises when shifting and difficulty engaging gears. Replacing the synchronizers costs around $1,000 - $1,500+.
    * **Clutch Master Cylinder Failure:** The clutch master cylinder can fail, causing the clutch to become inoperable. Symptoms include a spongy clutch pedal and difficulty shifting gears. Replacing the clutch master cylinder costs around $300 - $500+.
* **ZF 4HP22 4-Speed Automatic:**
    * **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter can fail on high-mileage transmissions, causing shuddering, slipping, or overheating. Symptoms include transmission slipping, delayed gear engagement, and overheating. Replacing the torque converter costs around $1,200 - $1,800+.
    * **Valve Body Wear:** The valve body in the transmission can wear out over time, causing shifting problems and hesitation. Symptoms include rough shifting, delayed gear engagement, and slipping. Replacing the valve body costs around $800 - $1,200+.

**Suspension**

* **Front Control Arm Bushings:** The front control arm bushings can wear out over time, causing clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Replacing the control arm bushings costs around $300 - $600+.
* **Rear Shock Mount Failure:** The rear shock mounts can fail on high-mileage vehicles, causing the rear shocks to become loose. Symptoms include excessive rear-end bounce, noise, and decreased handling. Replacing the rear shock mounts costs around $200 - $400+.
* **Springs Sagging:** The suspension springs can sag over time, reducing ride height and handling. Replacing the springs costs around $500 - $800+ for all four corners.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail on high-mileage vehicles, causing the battery to not charge properly. Symptoms include dim lights, a weak battery, and potential electrical problems. Replacing the alternator costs around $500 - $800+.
* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain due to a faulty component or parasitic draw. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle and a dead battery. The solution is to locate and eliminate the source of the battery drain, which costs around $100 - $500+ to repair.
* **Electrical Shorts:** Electrical shorts can occur in various components, causing electrical problems. Symptoms include blown fuses, flickering lights, and potential damage to other electrical systems. The solution is to locate and repair the electrical short, which costs around $200 - $600+ to fix.

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Undercarriage:** The undercarriage of the 325iX is prone to rusting, especially in areas where salt is used on the roads. Symptoms include visible rust on the underbody, suspension components, and exhaust system. Rust prevention and repair costs vary depending on the severity of the rust.
* **Sunroof Seal Failure:** The sunroof seal can fail over time, causing water leaks into the cabin. Symptoms include water dripping from the sunroof, wet headliner, and musty odors. Replacing the sunroof seal costs around $200 - $400+.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking:** The dashboard of the 325iX is known for developing cracks over time, especially on vehicles that have been exposed to direct sunlight. Symptoms include visible cracks on the dashboard surface. Replacing the dashboard costs around $1,000 - $1,500+.
* **Window Regulator Failure:** The window regulators can fail on the 325iX, causing the windows to become inoperable. Symptoms include windows that do not open or close properly, and potential window breakage. Replacing the window regulators costs around $200 - $400+ per window.

**Recalls**

* **NHTSA Campaign Number 00V044000:** Fuel Tank Failure
* **NHTSA Campaign Number 97V025000:** Power Window Switch Failure
* **NHTSA Campaign Number 96V043000:** Rear Seat Belt Failure

**Summary:**

The 1991 BMW 325iX is a reliable vehicle when properly maintained. However, like any older car, it has its share of potential issues. The most severe issues include engine failure, transmission failure, and electrical problems, which can be costly to repair. Regular maintenance and preventative measures can help extend the life of the 325iX and reduce the risk of these problems occurring.
