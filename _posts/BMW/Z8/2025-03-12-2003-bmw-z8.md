The 2003 BMW Z8 is a roadster known for its retro styling, powerful engine, and luxurious features. All Z8s came equipped with the same engine: a 4.9-liter V8 (S62) borrowed from the E39 M5, producing 394 horsepower and 368 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners generally praise the Z8 for its performance, exclusivity, and classic design. Common complaints often revolve around the high cost of maintenance, the complexity of the vehicle's electronics, and the availability of specific parts due to its limited production run.
