The 2002 BMW Z8 is a beautiful and iconic roadster, a modern interpretation of the classic 507. It was only offered with one engine and one transmission: a 4.9-liter (4941 cc) S62 V8 engine producing 394 horsepower and 368 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Getrag Type D 6-speed manual transmission. Owners love its stunning design, powerful engine, and engaging driving experience. However, some dislikes include the high cost of maintenance and repairs, and some consider the ride quality to be slightly firm. Given its age and low production numbers, finding qualified technicians for repairs can also be a challenge.
