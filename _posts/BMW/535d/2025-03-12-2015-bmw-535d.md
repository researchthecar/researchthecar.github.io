The 2015 BMW 535d is a popular luxury sedan known for its blend of performance, fuel efficiency, and comfort. It offers a strong diesel engine option, along with gasoline engine alternatives like the 528i's 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (240 hp, 260 lb-ft torque) and the 535i's 3.0L turbocharged inline-six (300 hp, 300 lb-ft torque). The 535d comes equipped with a 3.0L inline-six diesel engine producing 255 hp and a substantial 413 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the 535d's fuel economy, smooth ride, and powerful acceleration, while some common complaints involve potential maintenance costs, electrical gremlins, and the complexity of the iDrive system.

**Engine**

**3.0L Inline-Six Diesel (535d)**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, check engine light. The EGR cooler can crack and leak coolant into the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, DPF warning light on. Short trips and infrequent regeneration cycles can cause the DPF to become clogged with soot.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (either through a scan tool or extended highway driving), or DPF replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (forced regeneration) to $2000+ (DPF replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Summary**

The 2015 BMW 535d is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the diesel engine's emissions system components (EGR cooler, DPF) and the potential for HPFP failure. The ZF 8HP transmission is robust but can experience mechatronic sleeve leaks and valve body issues with age and mileage. Electrical problems, particularly with the iDrive system, are also common. Repair costs can be high due to the complexity of the vehicle and the price of BMW parts. Pre-purchase inspections and a thorough review of the vehicle's maintenance history are highly recommended.
