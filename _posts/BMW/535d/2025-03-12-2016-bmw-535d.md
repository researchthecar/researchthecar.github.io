Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2016 BMW 535d, formatted as requested.

The 2016 BMW 5 Series (F10 generation) is a popular luxury sedan praised for its blend of performance, comfort, and technology. The 535d model specifically features a 3.0-liter inline-6 diesel engine producing 255 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options available for the 2016 5 Series include the 528i (2.0L turbo-4), 535i (3.0L turbo inline-6), 550i (4.4L turbo V8), and ActiveHybrid 5 (turbo inline-6 with electric motor). Owners appreciate the 535d's exceptional fuel economy for its class, strong low-end torque, and overall refined driving experience. Common dislikes include the higher maintenance costs associated with BMWs, potential for electronic gremlins, and the somewhat firm ride quality (depending on suspension configuration).

**Engine**

**3.0L Inline-6 Diesel (N57D30)**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, "Check Engine" light. The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler can develop leaks, causing coolant to enter the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler. Some owners opt for aftermarket options or deleting the EGR system (check local regulations).

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW 535d offers a compelling package of performance and fuel efficiency, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. EGR cooler failure and DPF issues are common on the diesel engine and can be expensive to repair. Transmission problems, particularly with the mechatronic unit and torque converter, are also a concern. Electrical gremlins and suspension issues can add to the ownership costs. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite costly, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW mechanic essential. Regular maintenance, especially fluid changes, can help mitigate some of these risks.
