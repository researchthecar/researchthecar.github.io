### Summary Verdict
The 2000 BMW 540i (E39) offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but its age means potential owners should anticipate some common issues. The V8 engine, while powerful, is prone to cooling system leaks, oil leaks, and timing chain tensioner wear, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions can develop issues leading to harsh shifting or failure. Suspension components like control arm bushings and rear springs are also known to wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the ABS/DSC module and window regulators, are not uncommon. Exterior and interior issues are generally less severe but can affect aesthetics and comfort. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and addressing these known issues, the 540i can remain a rewarding vehicle.
