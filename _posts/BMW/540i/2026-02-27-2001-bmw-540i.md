### Summary Verdict
The 2001 BMW 540i (E39) is a capable and enjoyable vehicle, but its age means potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The V8 engine, while powerful, can be prone to cooling system leaks and timing chain tensioner wear, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions may develop shifting problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the ABS/DSC module and window regulators, are not uncommon. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks will likely need attention on higher-mileage examples. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, minor issues like headlight hazing and sagging headliners can occur. Regular maintenance and proactive addressing of these potential problems are key to maintaining the 540i's reliability and driving pleasure.
