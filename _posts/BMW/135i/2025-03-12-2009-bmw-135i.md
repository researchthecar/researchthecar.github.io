The 2009 BMW 135i is a compact performance coupe/convertible known for its engaging driving dynamics and potent engine. The main engine option for this model year is the N54 3.0-liter twin-turbo inline-six, producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. A less common engine option is the naturally aspirated 3.0-liter inline-six N52 engine. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 135i for its responsive handling, powerful engine, and relatively compact size. However, common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the N54 engine's high-pressure fuel pump and turbocharger system.

**Summary**

The 2009 BMW 135i, particularly those equipped with the N54 engine, can be a rewarding but potentially costly car to own. The most prevalent issues revolve around the N54 engine's fuel and turbocharger systems. While the HPFP issue may have been addressed under warranty or recall in some cases, turbocharger wastegate rattle, carbon buildup, and oil leaks remain common concerns. Suspension issues are also typical for a car of this age, and electrical problems can arise. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. Prospective buyers should thoroughly inspect the car's maintenance history and be prepared for potential maintenance expenses.
