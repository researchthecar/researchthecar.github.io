**Summary**

The 2013 BMW 135i, while a performance-oriented and enjoyable car, does have its share of common issues. Engine-related problems, such as oil leaks and HPFP failures, can be relatively expensive to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the DCT, can also be costly. Suspension problems, while not as frequent, can affect handling and require prompt attention. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in maintenance costs when considering this model. Severity of issues range from moderate (oil leaks, suspension bushings) to severe (DCT failure, HPFP failure). The cost to repair can be minimal but can also become substantial, with some repairs exceeding $2000.
