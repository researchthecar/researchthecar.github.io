The 2012 BMW 135i is a compact performance coupe known for its engaging driving dynamics and potent inline-6 engine. This model year came with two engine options: the N55 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, and the N54 3.0L twin-turbocharged inline-6 producing 320 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque, which was a very limited production model. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch (DCT) automatic. Owners often praise its nimble handling, strong acceleration, and relatively compact size making it fun to drive. Common dislikes include the higher cost of maintenance and repairs compared to non-luxury cars, potential for electrical issues, and the sometimes stiff ride.
