The 2023 BMW 330e xDrive is a plug-in hybrid variant of the popular BMW 3 Series sedan. It combines a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor, delivering a combined output of 288 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2023 3 Series include the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder in the 330i (255 hp), the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six in the M340i (382 hp), and the full-fledged M3 variants with a high-performance 3.0-liter inline-six (up to 503 hp).
