The 2016 BMW 428i xDrive is a luxury coupe, gran coupe (four-door coupe), and convertible known for its sporty handling, elegant styling, and comfortable interior. The 428i xDrive is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 240 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque. This engine is generally praised for its balance of performance and fuel efficiency. Other engine options for the 2016 4 Series include the 435i which has a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine, and the 420i. Both engines are paired with either a standard 6-speed manual transmission or an optional 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's responsive handling, upscale interior, and refined driving experience. Some common criticisms include the relatively firm ride (especially with the sport suspension), limited rear seat space in the coupe, and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (N20/N26)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often originating from the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, or oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level warning.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket. For more severe leaks, the entire valve cover or oil filter housing might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The N20/N26 engines have been known to experience timing chain issues, particularly in earlier model years. Symptoms include a rattling noise upon startup, rough running engine, check engine light, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioner. In severe cases, engine damage may necessitate engine repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are a known problem, often caused by failure of the plastic coolant expansion tank, hoses, or water pump. Symptoms include low coolant level warning, visible coolant leaks, and overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty components. A pressure test can help pinpoint the exact location of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the component.

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (GA8HP45Z/GA8HP50Z)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough shifting, hesitation, or delayed engagement, particularly between certain gears.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush might alleviate the issue in some cases. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement or transmission replacement. Software updates can sometimes address shifting issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the mechatronic unit (the transmission's control unit) can cause erratic shifting, limp mode, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Mechatronic unit replacement or repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Cracked or Broken Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Especially common in areas with harsh winters and salted roads, the coil springs can corrode and crack or break. This results in a clunking noise from the suspension, uneven ride height, and compromised handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the damaged coil springs (often recommended to replace in pairs).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per pair.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can lead to a dead battery, especially if the car is left parked for extended periods. Possible causes include faulty modules not shutting down properly, parasitic draw from aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
