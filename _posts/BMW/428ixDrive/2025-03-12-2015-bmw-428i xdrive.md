The 2015 BMW 428i xDrive is a stylish and sporty coupe, grand coupe (4-door), or convertible, powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 240 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque. This engine is known for its responsive performance and decent fuel economy. Other engine options available for the 2015 4 Series included the 435i's 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6, offering more power and a smoother driving experience.

People generally appreciate the 428i xDrive for its attractive design, engaging handling, and premium interior. Common complaints often revolve around repair costs, the run-flat tires' harsh ride, and some electronic gremlins.
