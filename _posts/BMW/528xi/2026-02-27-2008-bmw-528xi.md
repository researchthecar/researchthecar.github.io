### Summary Verdict
The 2008 BMW 528xi offers a compelling package of performance and luxury, but potential owners should be aware of common reliability concerns. The N52 inline-six engine, while generally robust, can be prone to oil leaks from the valve cover and oil pan gaskets, as well as PCV valve failures. The automatic transmission may experience fluid leaks or issues with the mechatronic unit. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also known wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the electric water pump and iDrive system, can arise. While the exterior and interior are generally durable, these specific mechanical and electrical issues represent the most common non-wear-and-tear problems reported for this model year.
