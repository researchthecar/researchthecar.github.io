The 2007 BMW M6 is a high-performance coupe and convertible based on the E63/E64 6-Series. It's celebrated for its powerful V10 engine and distinctive styling, but it's also known for its potential maintenance challenges. The M6 came equipped with only one engine option, a 5.0-liter V10 (S85) producing 500 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. The primary transmission option was a 7-speed SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox), although a traditional 6-speed manual was also available. Owners love the exhilarating performance and unique engine sound, but dislike the SMG's sometimes jerky operation, high running costs, and potential for expensive repairs.

**Engine**

**5.0L S85 V10**

*   **Rod Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking or ticking sound, especially when cold, is a common symptom. Excessive wear on the rod bearings can lead to catastrophic engine failure. Oil analysis might reveal excessive bearing material.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rod bearings with updated or aftermarket versions is the most common solution. Some owners opt to replace the connecting rod bolts at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Control Valve (ICV) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, or difficulty starting the engine are typical signs. The ICV regulates airflow to the engine during idle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ICV. Cleaning the ICV might provide temporary relief.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS (Variable Valve Timing) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, especially at lower RPMs, hesitation, and error codes related to VANOS performance. The VANOS system controls valve timing.
    *   Solution: Addressing VANOS issues can involve replacing solenoids, cleaning or replacing the VANOS high-pressure oil pump filter, or rebuilding the VANOS unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the specific issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Throttle Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Limp mode, reduced engine power, error codes relating to throttle actuator control. There are two throttle actuators, one for each bank of cylinders.

**Summary**

The 2007 BMW M6, while offering incredible performance, is prone to several potentially expensive issues. The most serious concerns revolve around the S85 V10 engine, particularly rod bearing failure, which can lead to complete engine destruction. The SMG transmission also presents potential problems with the pump and clutch. Suspension and electrical issues can also contribute to the ownership costs. Due to the car's age and complexity, thorough pre-purchase inspection and diligent maintenance are crucial. Overall, the M6 can be a rewarding car to own, but potential buyers should be prepared for the costs associated with maintaining a high-performance vehicle of this era.
