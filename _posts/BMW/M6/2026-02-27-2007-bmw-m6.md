### Summary Verdict
The 2007 BMW M6 is a performance icon that demands a premium for its upkeep. While the manual transmission variant is generally more reliable, the SMG III can present costly issues related to its hydraulic system. The V10 engine, while potent, is prone to expensive problems like rod bearing wear and throttle actuator failures, requiring vigilant maintenance and potentially significant repair budgets. Electrical gremlins and suspension component failures, particularly with the advanced Adaptive Drive system, are also points of concern. Prospective owners should budget for higher-than-average maintenance and repair costs, and prioritize vehicles with a documented service history, especially concerning the engine and transmission.
