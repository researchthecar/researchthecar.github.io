The 2009 BMW M6 is a high-performance sports coupe/convertible boasting a naturally aspirated 5.0L V10 engine producing 500 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox) transmission. Owners appreciate the M6 for its powerful engine, distinctive styling, and luxurious interior. However, they often cite high running costs, complex electronics, and potential for expensive repairs as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**5.0L V10 (S85)**
* **Rod Bearing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A knocking sound from the engine, especially at idle, and potential catastrophic engine failure. This is due to premature wear of the connecting rod bearings.
    * Solution: Replacement of the connecting rod bearings. Upgraded bearings with tighter tolerances are often recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and shop rates).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Throttle Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, rough idling, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to the throttle actuators are often present. The M6 has two throttle actuators, one for each bank of cylinders, making it possible for one or both to fail.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty throttle actuator(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (parts and labor, depending on how many need to be replaced).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **VANOS High Pressure Oil Line Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leak from the VANOS (Variable Valve Timing) high-pressure oil line, potentially leading to VANOS system malfunction.
    * Solution: Replacement of the VANOS high-pressure oil line.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Idle Control Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or erratic idling, stalling, and potential difficulty starting the engine.
    * Solution: Replacement of the idle control valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox)**
* **SMG Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Failure to shift gears, SMG malfunction warnings on the dashboard, and potential inability to start the car. The SMG pump is responsible for building hydraulic pressure to operate the transmission.
    * Solution: Replacement of the SMG pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **SMG Clutch Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, jerky shifting, and premature clutch wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the clutch and potentially the flywheel. Clutch replacement is considered regular maintenance on SMG vehicles, but these issues are accelerated due to the jerky shifting.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **SMG Hydraulic Line Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of hydraulic pressure in the SMG system, leading to shifting problems and potential transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking hydraulic lines.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **EDC (Electronic Damper Control) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Stiff or uncomfortable ride, EDC malfunction warnings on the dashboard, and potential uneven handling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty EDC shock absorber(s). The EDC shocks are expensive.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ per shock (depending on which shock needs to be replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, or general unresponsiveness of the iDrive infotainment system.
    * Solution: Software updates, replacement of the iDrive control unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The car battery draining overnight or within a short period of time, especially if the car is not driven frequently. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including a faulty alternator, a parasitic drain from an electrical component, or a bad battery.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the underlying cause of the battery drain, which may involve replacing the battery, alternator, or other electrical components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Headliner Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaching from the roof panel and sagging down into the cabin.
    * Solution: Replacement or re-gluing of the headliner.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2009 BMW M6, while a thrilling performance vehicle, is known for its potential for expensive repairs. The most significant issues revolve around the engine (specifically the rod bearings and throttle actuators) and the SMG transmission. The EDC suspension system and iDrive system are also known to cause problems. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in the cost of preventative maintenance and potential repairs when considering purchasing a 2009 BMW M6. Many of the issues can be catastrophic and cost thousands of dollars to repair.
