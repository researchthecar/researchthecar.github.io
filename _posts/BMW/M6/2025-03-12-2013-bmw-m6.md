The 2013 BMW M6 is a high-performance grand tourer available as a coupe or convertible. It packs a serious punch with its twin-turbocharged V8 engine. The M6 was offered with a single engine option, a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8, producing 560 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. Early models were offered with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT), and later models had the option of a 6-speed manual. Owners typically praise the M6 for its exhilarating performance, luxurious interior, and distinctive styling. Criticisms often revolve around its high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and sometimes harsh ride quality.
