The 2018 BMW M6 is a high-performance grand tourer coupe or convertible that delivers exhilarating performance and luxurious features. It came standard with a powerful 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 560 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. An optional Competition Package increased output to 600 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. The M6 was available with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Many owners praise the M6 for its incredible acceleration, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. Common complaints revolve around maintenance costs, some electrical gremlins, and the car's weight, which can make it feel less nimble than smaller M cars.

**Engine**

**4.4L Twin-Turbocharged V8 (S63)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or line. Ensure proper torque specifications are followed during reassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+, depending on the source of the leak and labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **VANOS Solenoid Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: VANOS (Variable Nockenwellen Steuerung) system controls variable valve timing, so symptoms of failure are poor performance and drivability. These solenoids can fail, resulting in a check engine light, rough idle, reduced power, and poor fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty VANOS solenoid(s) followed by clearing the error codes.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per solenoid, including parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HPFP is responsible for delivering fuel to the engine at high pressure. Failures can cause long cranking times, misfires, rough running, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP with an updated unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+, including parts and labor.
     * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT - Getrag GS7-54BG)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit controls the shifting of the DCT. Issues can manifest as jerky shifts, delayed engagement, failure to shift, or transmission malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuilding of the mechatronic unit. In some cases, reprogramming may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+, depending on the repair and whether a new or rebuilt unit is used.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the high performance nature of the M6 and the aggressive driving habits of many owners, clutch wear can be accelerated. Symptoms include slipping during acceleration, shuddering, and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is necessary when wear reaches a critical point.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+, depending on the shop and whether OEM or aftermarket parts are used.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The M6 features adaptive dampers that adjust damping based on driving conditions. Failures can result in a harsh or bouncy ride, uneven handling, and error messages on the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per damper, including parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system controls various vehicle functions, including navigation, audio, and climate control. Malfunctions can include screen freezing, system crashes, and unresponsive controls.
    *   Solution: Software updates, component replacement (e.g., head unit), or wiring harness repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+, depending on the complexity of the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can lead to a dead battery, especially if the car is not driven frequently. Potential causes include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, and parasitic draws.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the cause.
     * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 BMW M6 offers exhilarating performance, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine oil leaks, VANOS solenoid issues, and potential HPFP failures can lead to substantial repair bills. Transmission problems, particularly with the mechatronic unit, can also be costly. While many of these issues are not universal, they are common enough to warrant careful inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW technician. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major component failures, with repair costs potentially exceeding several thousand dollars. Buyers should factor these potential expenses into their ownership budget.
