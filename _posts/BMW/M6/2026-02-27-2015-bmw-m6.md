### Summary Verdict
The 2015 BMW M6 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, with a generally solid reliability record for its class. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the complex powertrain, particularly the twin-turbo V8 engine's ancillary components like wastegate actuators and fuel injectors, and the sophisticated M-DCT transmission's mechatronics unit and clutch packs. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive system glitches and battery drain, can also occur. While the manual transmission and other systems like suspension, exterior, and interior show fewer documented widespread issues, proactive maintenance and thorough pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended for any high-performance vehicle of this age.
