The 2008 BMW M6 is a high-performance grand tourer known for its exhilarating driving experience. It features a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V10 engine (S85) producing 500 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. It was offered with two transmission options: a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox). Owners often praise the M6's powerful engine, distinctive exhaust note, and sharp handling. However, the car is also criticized for its complex and potentially unreliable systems, leading to high maintenance costs. Some owners find the SMG transmission jerky at low speeds and the ride quality firm.
