The 2015 BMW M6 is a high-performance grand tourer that offers a blend of luxury and exhilarating performance. It came in coupe, convertible ("Cabriolet"), and four-door coupe ("Gran Coupe") body styles. All models are powered by a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 560 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. An optional Competition Package increased output to 575 hp. The engine could be paired with either a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (DCT) or a traditional 6-speed manual transmission. People often praise the M6 for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and responsive handling. However, some criticisms include its high price tag, potential for costly repairs, and somewhat numb steering feel compared to older M cars.
