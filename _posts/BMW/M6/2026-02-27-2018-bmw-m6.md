### Summary Verdict
The 2018 BMW M6 is a highly capable performance vehicle with a generally good reliability record for its class. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the complex powertrain, specifically the twin-turbocharged V8 engine's wastegate actuators and potential oil leaks from valve cover gaskets. The M-DCT transmission, while offering rapid shifts, can be prone to mechatronics unit failures or clutch wear, representing significant repair costs. The Adaptive M Suspension's electronic components can also be a source of expense if they malfunction. Electrical issues are typically minor, often related to iDrive software glitches or battery drain. Overall, for owners who adhere to a strict maintenance schedule and are prepared for potential high-cost repairs on the powertrain and suspension, the M6 can be a rewarding ownership experience.
