### Summary Verdict
The 2013 BMW M6 is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but its high-performance nature means certain components are subject to more stress and potential failure. The twin-turbocharged V8 engine, while potent, can experience issues with turbochargers and oil leaks. The M-DCT transmission, a complex piece of engineering, is prone to mechatronics unit and clutch pack problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system and battery drain, are also noted. While the suspension and exterior/interior generally hold up well, owners should be prepared for potentially significant repair costs associated with the engine and transmission, especially if they are outside of warranty. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining this performance car.
