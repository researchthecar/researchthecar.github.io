The 2022 BMW 330e is a plug-in hybrid variant of the popular 3 Series sedan, combining a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor. This powertrain delivers a combined output of 288 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. While the 330e emphasizes efficiency and electric driving range, other engine options for the 2022 3 Series include the 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder in the 330i (255 hp, 295 lb-ft) and the 3.0-liter turbo inline-six in the M340i (382 hp, 369 lb-ft). All 2022 3 Series models typically use an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 330e for its fuel economy, sporty handling, and comfortable interior. However, some criticisms include the reduced trunk space due to the battery pack and the sometimes-jerky transitions between electric and gasoline power.
