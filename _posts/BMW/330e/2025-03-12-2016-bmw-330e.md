The 2016 BMW 330e is a plug-in hybrid variant of the popular 3 Series sedan. It combines a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor. The combined output is 248 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. The 330e comes exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People appreciate the 330e for its blend of fuel efficiency and BMW's sporty handling. However, some dislike the smaller trunk space due to the battery pack and the complexity of the hybrid system, which can lead to potential maintenance issues. Other engine options available for the 2016 3 Series lineup include various gasoline and diesel engines, but only the 330e model features the plug-in hybrid powertrain.
