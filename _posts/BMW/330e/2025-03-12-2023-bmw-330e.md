The 2023 BMW 330e is a plug-in hybrid variant of the popular 3 Series sedan, known for blending electric efficiency with BMW's signature driving dynamics. It combines a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 288 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission is an 8-speed automatic. Other engine options for the 2023 3 Series include a 2.0-liter turbo-4 in the 330i (255 hp/295 lb-ft), a 3.0-liter turbo-6 in the M340i (382 hp/369 lb-ft) and the M3 (473-503 hp). Many owners appreciate the 330e for its fuel efficiency, sporty handling, and comfortable interior, while some find the electric range limited and the price premium over the standard 330i a drawback.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**
* **Reduced Electric Range**
    * Description/Symptoms: Drivers report the actual electric-only range is often less than the advertised range (20 miles), especially in colder weather or with aggressive driving. The displayed range may fluctuate dramatically.
    * Solution: No specific fix, but optimizing driving habits (gentle acceleration, pre-conditioning the cabin while plugged in) can help maximize range. BMW also released software updates for the hybrid system that may improve efficiency.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Battery**
* **Battery Charging Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may fail to charge, or charge very slowly. The charging indicator light may not illuminate, or the charging process may terminate prematurely. Sometimes caused by a faulty charging cable.
