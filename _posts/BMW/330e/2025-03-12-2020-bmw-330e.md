The 2020 BMW 330e is a plug-in hybrid sedan that blends performance and efficiency. It features a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 252 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. The 330e offers all-electric driving range for short commutes while providing the flexibility of a gasoline engine for longer trips. Some owners appreciate the fuel economy and sporty driving dynamics, while others find the electric range limiting and the hybrid system complex. A traditional gasoline only version, the 330i, is also available with the same 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine without the hybrid components, producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines come standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission.
