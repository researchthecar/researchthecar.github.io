The 2024 BMW 330e is a plug-in hybrid variant of the popular 3 Series sedan, blending electric power with a traditional gasoline engine for enhanced fuel efficiency and performance. The 330e features a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, delivering a combined output of 288 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2024 3 Series include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (330i), a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six (M340i), and high-performance variants of the M3. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 330e for its responsive acceleration, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior. Some common dislikes include the relatively small trunk space due to the hybrid battery pack, and the complexity of the infotainment system.

* **Reduced Electric Range**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing lower-than-advertised electric driving range, particularly in cold weather or when driving at higher speeds. The range can be significantly impacted by driving style and climate control usage.
    * Solution: There isn't a direct "fix" as the range is dependent on driving conditions. BMW may suggest software updates to optimize energy management, but the fundamental limitation remains.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Electric Motor Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the electric motor malfunctioning, leading to reduced power output, error messages on the dashboard, and a switch to gasoline-only operation.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified BMW technician is required. The electric motor may need to be replaced or repaired. In some cases, related components such as the power electronics or battery management system may also need attention.
