The 2022 BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupe is a sporty and stylish four-door coupe known for its performance and practicality. It's powered by a potent 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine producing 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. There were no other engine options available for the 2022 model year. The engine is paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally praise the M440i for its engaging driving dynamics, comfortable interior, and sleek design.
