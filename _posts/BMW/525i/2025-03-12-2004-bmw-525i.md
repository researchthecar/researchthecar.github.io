**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-Six (M54B25)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue in older BMWs. The valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, and oil pan gasket are typical culprits. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the location and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cooling system in the E60 525i is prone to failure due to plastic components degrading over time. This includes the water pump, thermostat housing, radiator hoses, and expansion tank. Symptoms include overheating, coolant leaks, and the engine running hotter than normal.
    *   Solution: Replace the failing components. Consider replacing multiple cooling system parts at once to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the parts replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Valve Timing (VANOS) system can experience issues, leading to reduced engine performance, rough idling, and fault codes. The VANOS seals can degrade over time, causing problems with oil pressure and timing.
    *   Solution: Replace the VANOS seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
