However, like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues.

**Engine:**

* **3.0L N52 Inline-6 Engine**

    * **Oil Filter Housing Gasket Leak:** An issue with the gasket seal on the oil filter housing can cause oil leakage. The leak is typically visible on the front of the engine and can range from a minor seepage to a significant leak.
        * Solution: Replace the oil filter housing gasket.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300+
        * Recalls: None Found

* **Valvetronic System Failure:** The Valvetronic system, which controls the timing and lift of the intake valves, can fail due to a faulty sensor or wiring harness issue. This can lead to reduced engine performance, rough idling, and increased emissions.
        * Solution: Diagnose and repair the faulty sensor or wiring harness.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
        * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission:**

        * Solution: Replace the shifter bushings.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
        * Recalls: None Found

* **6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

    * **Mechatronic Sleeve Failure:** The mechatronic sleeve, which contains the transmission's computer and hydraulic valves, can fail due to excessive wear or a fluid leak. This can lead to transmission slipping, harsh shifting, or a loss of power.
        * Solution: Replace the mechatronic sleeve.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
        * Recalls: None Found
