### Summary Verdict
The 2007 BMW 525i offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The N52 engine, while generally robust, can suffer from oil leaks due to aging gaskets and PCV system failures. The electric water pump is another notable concern that can lead to overheating if not addressed. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also prone to wear, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and water ingress from clogged sunroof drains, can be frustrating. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and proactive repairs, the 2007 525i can remain a reliable and enjoyable luxury sedan.
