### Summary Verdict
The 2004 BMW 525i (E60) offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 3.0L inline-six engine, while generally robust, is prone to oil leaks and cooling system problems. Automatic transmissions, particularly the ZF 6HP19Z, can experience costly mechatronic unit failures. Suspension components like control arm bushings are wear items that require attention. Electrically, window regulators, light control modules, and ABS/DSC modules are known weak points. Interior electronics, especially the iDrive system and displays, can also develop faults. Despite these potential issues, many problems are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, allowing the 525i to remain an enjoyable vehicle.
