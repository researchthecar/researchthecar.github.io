The 2021 BMW 745Le xDrive is a plug-in hybrid variant of the flagship 7 Series sedan, offering a blend of luxury, performance, and fuel efficiency. It features a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 389 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2021 7 Series include a 3.0-liter inline-6 turbo (non-hybrid), a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8, and a 6.6-liter twin-turbo V12 (depending on the specific 7 Series model). All engines are typically paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 745Le for its smooth ride, luxurious interior, advanced technology, and the ability to drive short distances on electric power alone. Common complaints include the complexity of the infotainment system, the high cost of maintenance and repairs, and occasional issues related to the hybrid system.
