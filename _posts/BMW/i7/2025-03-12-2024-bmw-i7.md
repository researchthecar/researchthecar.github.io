The 2024 BMW i7 is a flagship luxury sedan that represents BMW's commitment to electric mobility. It is available in several configurations, but the i7 xDrive60 is the most common. It boasts a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system producing a combined 536 horsepower and 549 lb-ft of torque. Other powertrains include the M70 xDrive, which increases the horsepower and torque significantly. People generally appreciate the i7's opulent interior, advanced technology features, and smooth, quiet ride. However, some common dislikes include the bold (and some say controversial) exterior styling, the high price tag, and the complexity of the infotainment system. Some people feel the acceleration, while impressive, isn't as neck-snapping as some other high-performance EVs.

**Electric Motor**

**i7 xDrive60 (Dual Motor)**

* **Electric Motor Failure (Rare)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Complete loss of power, vehicle unable to start or move. May be preceded by error messages related to the electric motor. This is a rare occurrence, but some owners have reported it.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected electric motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $15,000 - $25,000+ (includes labor)

**Battery**

**All i7 Models**

* **Reduced Range Under Cold Weather Conditions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Significant drop in driving range during cold weather (below freezing). This is a characteristic of all EVs due to the chemical processes within the battery being less efficient in cold temperatures.
    * Solution: Pre-conditioning the battery before driving, parking in a garage, using seat heaters and steering wheel heaters to reduce reliance on cabin heating. This is more of a characteristic limitation than a defect.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (characteristic of EV tech)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Charging System**

**All i7 Models**

* **Inconsistent Charging Speeds at Public Charging Stations**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle charges slower than the advertised maximum charging rate at some public DC fast-charging stations. This can be due to variations in charging station performance or communication issues between the car and the charging station.
    * Solution: Trying a different charging station or contacting the charging network provider to report the issue. Ensuring the charging cable is properly connected.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies; could be a charging station issue (no cost to the vehicle owner) or a vehicle charging system issue ($500-$2000).
