The 2023 BMW i7 is a fully electric luxury sedan, offering a blend of performance, technology, and comfort. It boasts a powerful electric powertrain, delivering impressive acceleration and range. The i7 is often praised for its opulent interior, cutting-edge technology features like the BMW Curved Display and available Theatre Screen, and smooth, quiet ride. However, some owners have reported issues with the complex electronics, certain interior components, and the adaptive suspension system.

* **Motor Malfunction Leading to Reduced Power**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of one or both electric motors experiencing a malfunction, leading to a significant reduction in power output and potentially triggering warning lights on the dashboard. This can occur intermittently or become a persistent problem.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a certified BMW technician is necessary to pinpoint the faulty motor or associated components (inverter, wiring harness). Replacement of the affected motor(s) is often required. In some cases, a software update might resolve the issue if it stems from a control module problem.
