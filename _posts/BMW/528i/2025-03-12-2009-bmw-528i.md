The 2009 BMW 528i is part of the E60 5-Series generation, known for its blend of luxury, performance, and driver engagement. The 528i specifically came with a 3.0L naturally aspirated inline-6 engine (N52B30) producing around 230 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included the 535i with a turbocharged inline-6 and the 550i with a V8. Transmission choices were typically a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the 528i's comfortable ride, precise handling, and upscale interior. However, common complaints revolve around the higher cost of maintenance and potential for electrical issues, as well as some reliability concerns with certain engine components.
