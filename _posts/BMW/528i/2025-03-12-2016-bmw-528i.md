The 2016 BMW 528i is a popular luxury sedan known for its blend of performance, comfort, and technology. The 528i is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2016 5 Series include the 535i's 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six (300 hp/300 lb-ft) and the 550i's 4.4-liter turbocharged V8 (445 hp/480 lb-ft). All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 528i for its responsive handling, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. However, some common complaints include the cost of maintenance, potential for electrical issues, and the sometimes-complex iDrive infotainment system.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (N20)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various points on the engine, including the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the source of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain in the N20 engine can stretch or fail, leading to rough running, engine noise (rattling), and potential engine damage. This is a well-documented problem in earlier N20 engines, and while BMW made revisions, it can still occur in the 2016 model year.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, specifically from the coolant hoses, expansion tank, and water pump. Signs of coolant leaks include an overheating engine, low coolant level, and visible coolant puddles under the car.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the source of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough shifting, particularly during downshifts, or hesitation when accelerating. This can be related to the transmission's adaptive learning or potential issues with the valve body.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission overhaul may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission overhaul).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. It can also lead to vague steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response, or complete failure of the iDrive infotainment system. This can be due to software glitches or hardware failure.
    *   Solution: Software update, module reset, or replacement of the iDrive controller unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $1,200+ (controller replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain leading to difficulty starting the vehicle. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. Replace the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (diagnostics) - $500+ (depending on the source of the draw).
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per handle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    * Solution: Repair the motor, replace parts to keep the mechanism moving, realign or replace the sunroof.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW 528i, while a desirable luxury sedan, is not without its potential issues. The most concerning are related to the engine, particularly the timing chain and oil leaks in the 2.0L N20 engine. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system and battery drain, are also common. Suspension issues and sunroof issues add to the list of potential headaches. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs, with estimated costs varying widely depending on the specific problem. Overall, while the 528i offers a comfortable and enjoyable driving experience, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of potential repairs when making their decision.
