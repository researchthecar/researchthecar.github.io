This information is compiled from owner reports, repair databases, and forum discussions. The 2013 BMW 528i is a popular luxury sedan known for its blend of performance, comfort, and technology. It's generally praised for its handling and fuel efficiency. However, owners have reported issues ranging from minor annoyances to more significant mechanical problems. The base model 528i comes equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 3.0-liter inline-6 in the 535i (300 hp/300 lb-ft) and a 4.4-liter V8 in the 550i (400 hp/450 lb-ft).

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (N20)**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine noise (rattling) upon startup, especially when cold. Can progress to more consistent rattling and eventually lead to engine damage if the timing chain fails completely. This is due to premature wear of the timing chain and/or its associated guides and tensioner.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.  Inspection of related components for damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of damage and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket, Oil Filter Housing)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the engine, burning oil smell, low oil level warnings.  Common leak points are the valve cover gasket and the oil filter housing gasket.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket(s). Thorough cleaning of the affected area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve Cover Gasket: $300 - $700; Oil Filter Housing Gasket: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks (Water Pump, Coolant Hoses)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant level warnings, overheating, visible coolant leaks. The water pump and various coolant hoses are prone to developing leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty water pump and/or coolant hoses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Water Pump: $600 - $1,200; Coolant Hoses: $200 - $600+ (depending on which hoses are affected)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6 (N55)**

* **VANOS Solenoid Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased performance, and potential check engine lights. VANOS (Variable Nockenwellen Steuerung) solenoids control oil flow to the camshafts which controls valve timing. When the solenoid fails, it will no longer provide correct oil flow causing the engine to not run as intended.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty VANOS solenoids.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ depending on labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

**4.4L Turbocharged V8 (N63)**

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Stem Seals)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blue smoke from exhaust on startup, excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Replacement of valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (GA8HP45Z)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, or when downshifting.  May be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and adaptation reset can improve shifting.  In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush & adaptation reset: $300-$500; Valve body repair/replacement: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps.  Vague steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings.  In some cases, it's more cost-effective to replace the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushing replacement: $300 - $700 per control arm; Complete control arm replacement: $500 - $1,000 per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Adaptive Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard related to the adaptive suspension system (Dynamic Damper Control - DDC).  Ride quality may be compromised.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific fault in the system.  Possible replacement of dampers, sensors, or the control module.
