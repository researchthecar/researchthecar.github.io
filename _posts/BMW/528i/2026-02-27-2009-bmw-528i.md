### Summary Verdict
The 2009 BMW 528i (E60) is a capable luxury sedan with a generally good reliability record for its class and age. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the engine's cooling system (electric water pump) and potential oil leaks from gaskets (valve cover, oil pan). Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can arise but are not universally reported. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module, are also a possibility. While the manual transmission is robust, the automatic requires diligent maintenance. Overall, with proactive maintenance and addressing common issues promptly, the 528i can remain a reliable and enjoyable vehicle.
