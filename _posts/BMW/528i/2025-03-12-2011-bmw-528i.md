The 2011 BMW 528i is part of the F10 generation of the 5 Series, offering a blend of luxury, performance, and technology. The 528i specifically is powered by a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (N52B30) producing 240 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2011 5 Series include the 535i's 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (N55B30) and the 550i's 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 (N63B44). Transmission options included an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 528i for its comfortable ride, refined interior, and responsive handling. Common criticisms include higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury brands, complex electronics that can be prone to issues, and somewhat numb steering feel compared to older BMW models.

**Summary**

The 2011 BMW 528i, while offering a luxurious driving experience, is prone to several common issues. Engine oil leaks and VANOS solenoid problems can lead to moderate repair costs. Suspension issues, particularly with thrust arm bushings, affect ride quality and handling. Electrical issues, such as battery drain and iDrive malfunctions, can be frustrating and require professional diagnosis. Overall, while many of these issues are not catastrophic, they can contribute to higher long-term ownership costs. The severity of the issues range from minor inconveniences to more serious mechanical problems, and the estimated cost to fix them varies widely depending on the specific issue and the repair needed. Pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance are highly recommended.
