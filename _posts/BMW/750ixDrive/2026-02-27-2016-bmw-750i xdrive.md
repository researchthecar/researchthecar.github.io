### Summary Verdict
The 2016 BMW 750i xDrive is generally a reliable luxury vehicle, with its powerful 4.4L V8 engine and 8-speed automatic transmission demonstrating solid performance and durability. The primary areas where owners might encounter issues are related to the advanced adaptive air suspension system, which can develop leaks or compressor problems, and certain electrical components, particularly the iDrive infotainment system experiencing software glitches or parasitic battery drain. Interior climate control actuators can also be a point of failure. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not indicative of systemic failure across the board. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are recommended.
