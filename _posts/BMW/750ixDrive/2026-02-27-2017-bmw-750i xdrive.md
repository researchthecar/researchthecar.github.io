### Summary Verdict
The 2017 BMW 750i xDrive presents a generally strong reliability record for a vehicle of its complexity and luxury class. The powertrain, including the 4.4L twin-turbo V8 engine and 8-speed automatic transmission, is robust and has few documented widespread issues. Potential concerns tend to lie within the advanced suspension system, particularly air spring leaks and control arm bushing wear, and the sophisticated electrical systems, where infotainment glitches and battery drain can occur. Interior climate control actuators are another area to monitor. While repair costs can be significant due to the premium nature of the components, these issues are not universally reported and often stem from the inherent complexity of a high-end luxury sedan. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any emerging symptoms are crucial for maintaining the 750i xDrive's reliability and performance.
