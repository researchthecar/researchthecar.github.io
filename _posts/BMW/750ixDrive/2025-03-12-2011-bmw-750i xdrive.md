*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often originating from the valve cover gaskets, turbocharger oil lines, or the rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals is necessary. For turbo oil lines, sometimes a redesigned line can help prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+, depending on the location and severity of the leak. Valve cover gaskets are typically less expensive than a rear main seal replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points in the cooling system, including the coolant expansion tank, hoses, water pump, and radiator. Symptoms include low coolant level warnings, visible coolant leaks (often green or blue), and engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking component is required. Inspecting all hoses and connections during the repair is advisable.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector (including labor).
     * Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The N63 is a twin-turbocharged engine, and the turbochargers themselves can experience issues such as oil leaks, bearing failure, or wastegate malfunction. Symptoms include reduced power, whistling noises from the engine, and potentially turbocharger failure.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the turbocharger(s) may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ per turbocharger (including labor).

     * Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Sleeve Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic sleeve, which seals the electrical connector to the transmission, can leak over time. This can cause transmission malfunctions or fluid loss.
