*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, oil filter housing gasket, and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine or ground, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gasket or seal is the typical solution. For more severe leaks, a full engine reseal may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Valve Timing (VANOS) system relies on solenoids to control oil flow to adjust camshaft timing. Failure of these solenoids can lead to rough idling, reduced engine performance, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty VANOS solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifts, particularly when the transmission is cold. Hesitation during acceleration can also occur.
    *   Solution: A software update for the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission flush or replacement of the valve body may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) to $3,000+ (valve body/transmission replacement).

*   **Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with air suspension can experience problems with the air struts, compressor, or control module. Symptoms include the vehicle sitting unevenly, a rough ride, or failure of the suspension to adjust ride height.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty air strut, compressor, or control module. Diagnosis is crucial to pinpoint the exact cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per component replaced.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, leading to a dead battery, especially if the vehicle sits unused for extended periods. This can be difficult to diagnose, as it may involve a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Thorough electrical system testing to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include faulty control modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (simple fix) to $1,000+ (complex electrical issues).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can experience glitches, freezes, or complete failures. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,500+ (control unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Adaptive Headlight Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adaptive headlights, which swivel to illuminate curves, can sometimes malfunction. This can result in error messages on the dashboard or the headlights failing to operate correctly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine if the headlight motor, control module, or wiring is the cause. Replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters can fail to warm properly or stop working altogether. This can be due to a faulty heating element or control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the cause, followed by replacement of the heating element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per seat.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 BMW 650i Gran Coupe, while a luxurious and performance-oriented vehicle, can be susceptible to several issues. Engine oil leaks, VANOS solenoid failures, and transmission issues are among the most common and potentially costly problems. Electrical issues such as battery drain and iDrive malfunctions can also be frustrating. Air suspension problems, if equipped, can further add to the maintenance costs.
