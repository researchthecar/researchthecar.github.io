The 2014 BMW 650i Gran Coupe is a stylish and luxurious four-door coupe that offers a blend of performance and comfort. The model year offered two gasoline engine options: a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (640i) and a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (650i). The 650i generates 445 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque, providing brisk acceleration and a refined driving experience. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically praise the 650i Gran Coupe for its sleek design, powerful engine, comfortable interior, and advanced technology features. Some common dislikes include the high cost of maintenance and repairs, the complicated iDrive system, and the limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline.

**Engine**

**4.4L Twin-Turbocharged V8 (N63TU)**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue with the N63TU engine. The valve cover gaskets and oil pan gasket are known failure points. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil spots on the ground, and a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various locations including the coolant transfer pipe (the "valley pan" located under the intake manifold), water pump, and radiator hoses. Symptoms include a low coolant level, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    * Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty component. Repair of the coolant transfer pipe requires removing the intake manifold.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: High-pressure fuel injectors can fail, leading to rough running, misfires, and a check engine light.

    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or delayed shifting, particularly when cold or under heavy acceleration. This can also manifest as hesitation when shifting between gears.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission software update can address the issue. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement might be necessary. Complete transmission replacement is rare but possible.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $4000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 650i Gran Coupe may be equipped with air suspension, particularly on higher trim levels or with specific option packages.

**Summary:**

The 2014 BMW 650i Gran Coupe offers a luxurious driving experience but can be prone to several issues, particularly related to the engine, cooling system, and electronics. Oil and coolant leaks on the N63TU engine are relatively common and can be expensive to repair. Electrical issues, such as iDrive malfunctions and battery drain, can also be frustrating. The air suspension (if equipped) can also add to the maintenance costs. The overall severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures. The cost of repairs can be substantial, particularly for engine-related issues and air suspension components. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
