### Summary Verdict
The 2017 BMW 650i Gran Coupe is a powerful and luxurious vehicle that generally performs well. However, owners should be aware of potential issues related to its advanced powertrain and suspension systems. The twin-turbocharged V8 engine can experience problems with turbochargers, ignition coils, and fuel injectors, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission, while robust, may develop leaks or issues with the mechatronic unit. The sophisticated Adaptive Drive suspension can also be a source of expensive repairs if the active roll stabilization system malfunctions. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are typically well-built, these specific technical areas represent the most common and significant reliability concerns for this model.
