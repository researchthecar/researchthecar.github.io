Owners often praise the 650i Gran Coupe for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and elegant design. However, some common complaints include electronic glitches, expensive maintenance, and potential issues with the engine and transmission as the car ages.

**Engine**

**N63 4.4L TwinPower Turbo V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue as the car ages. These leaks often originate from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil spots on the ground, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or lines is the typical solution. This can involve significant labor, especially for leaks near the turbochargers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ depending on the location and complexity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cooling system in the N63 engine can be prone to leaks, especially in the coolant transfer pipe located in the "V" of the engine. The coolant expansion tank is also known to crack and leak over time.
    *   Solution: The solution involves replacing the leaking components, which can be labor-intensive, particularly for the coolant transfer pipe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the location of the leak
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Stem Seal Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: As the N63 ages, the valve stem seals can harden and crack, leading to oil leaking into the combustion chamber. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, especially upon startup after the car has been sitting for a while, and increased oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve stem seals is the solution. This repair requires removing the cylinder heads, making it a costly repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**N55 3.0L Turbocharged Inline-Six**
* **Oil Filter Housing Gasket Leak**
  * Description/Symptoms: The oil filter housing gasket can leak over time. This can lead to oil dripping onto other engine components causing a burning smell.
  * Solution: Replace the oil filter housing gasket.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$600
  * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 8HP 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or delayed shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update may alleviate the issue. In some cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 (fluid flush) - $5,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with air suspension may experience issues with the air struts or compressor. Symptoms include a sagging suspension, uneven ride height, or a non-functional suspension system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts or compressor is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut, $500 - $1,500 for the compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system can experience glitches, freezes, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Software updates or replacement of the iDrive control unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur, leading to a dead battery, especially if the car is not driven frequently.
    *   Solution: Identifying the parasitic drain and addressing the faulty component is required. This could range from faulty door actuators, radio, or any other number of components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Summary:**

The 2015 BMW 650i Gran Coupe, while offering a luxurious and sporty driving experience, has its share of potential issues. Engine oil and coolant leaks, particularly with the N63 engine, are common and can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, electrical glitches, and suspension problems (if equipped with air suspension) can also arise. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant repair bills, making pre-purchase inspection and a thorough service history review crucial for prospective buyers. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly.
