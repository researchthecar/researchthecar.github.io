However, there have been some reported issues with the vehicle:

**Engine:**

* **N63 Twin-Turbocharged V8**
    * **Valve Stem Seal Failure:** Worn valve stem seals can cause excessive oil consumption, resulting in blue exhaust smoke, low oil levels, and potential engine damage. Solution: Replace valve stem seals. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    * **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** A faulty timing chain tensioner can lead to stretched or broken timing chains, resulting in catastrophic engine failure. Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
* **N55 Twin-Turbocharged Inline-6 (Optional)**
    * No Significant Issues Found

**Transmission:**

**Summary:**

The 2014 BMW 650i Gran Coupe offers impressive performance and luxury, but it has experienced some issues. Engine-related problems, such as valve stem seal failure and timing chain tensioner failure, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, including mechatronic unit failure and torque converter shudder, can also impact drivability. Electrical glitches, exterior handle issues, and interior component failures are less severe but can be annoying and affect the vehicle's overall experience. Potential owners should be aware of these issues and factor in the potential cost of repairs when considering purchasing a used 2014 BMW 650i Gran Coupe.
