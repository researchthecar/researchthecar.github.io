### Summary Verdict
The 2019 BMW M6 Gran Coupe is a robust performance sedan with a generally good reliability record. The primary areas where owners might encounter issues are related to the sophisticated 4.4L twin-turbo V8 engine, particularly the wastegate actuators and potential coolant leaks from the valley pan gasket. The M-DCT transmission, while offering rapid shifts, can sometimes experience problems with its mechatronics unit or clutch packs. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. However, these issues are not universally reported and often depend on maintenance history and driving conditions. For a high-performance vehicle of this caliber, proactive maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly are key to long-term reliability.
