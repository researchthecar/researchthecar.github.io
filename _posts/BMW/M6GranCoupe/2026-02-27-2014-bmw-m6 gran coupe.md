# 2014 BMW M6 Gran Coupe

### Overview
The 2014 BMW M6 Gran Coupe, a high-performance luxury sedan, generally exhibits strong reliability, reflecting BMW's engineering prowess. However, as with any complex performance vehicle, certain areas warrant attention. The potent V8 engine, while powerful, can be a source of specific, albeit not universal, issues. Transmission systems, particularly the dual-clutch automatic, are robust but can require specialized attention. Electrical systems, common in modern luxury cars, present a few potential points of concern. Suspension and exterior/interior components are typically well-built, though age and mileage can introduce typical wear.
