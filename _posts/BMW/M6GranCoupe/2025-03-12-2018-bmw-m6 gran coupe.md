The 2018 BMW M6 Gran Coupe is a high-performance four-door coupe that blends luxury with exhilarating power. It came equipped with a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that produced 560 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque in its standard form, and 600 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque in the Competition Package version. The engine was paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praise the M6 Gran Coupe for its stunning design, powerful engine, and comfortable yet sporty ride.
