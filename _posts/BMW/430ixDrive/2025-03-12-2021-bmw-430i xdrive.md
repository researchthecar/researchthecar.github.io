The 2021 BMW 430i xDrive is part of the second-generation (G22) 4 Series, known for its controversial large kidney grille design. The 430i xDrive boasts a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include the M440i xDrive with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six, and the rear-wheel-drive 430i. All models come standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission.
