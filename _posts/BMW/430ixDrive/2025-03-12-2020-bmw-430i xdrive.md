The 2020 BMW 430i xDrive is a popular luxury coupe, known for its sleek styling, sporty handling, and comfortable interior. It's generally praised for its driving dynamics and premium features, but some owners have reported experiencing certain issues. The 430i xDrive comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some drivers dislike the run-flat tires and the sometimes-complicated iDrive infotainment system. Other engine and transmission options for the 4 series include the 430i, M440i and M4.
