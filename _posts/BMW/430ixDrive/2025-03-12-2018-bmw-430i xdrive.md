The 2018 BMW 430i xDrive is a popular luxury coupe, known for its sporty handling and stylish design. It's powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 4 Series in 2018 included the more powerful 3.0-liter inline-6 in the 440i. Both engines were typically paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, but a 6-speed manual was available on some models. Owners often praise the 430i xDrive for its responsive engine, comfortable ride, and upscale interior, while some common criticisms include a somewhat cramped rear seat and expensive maintenance costs.
