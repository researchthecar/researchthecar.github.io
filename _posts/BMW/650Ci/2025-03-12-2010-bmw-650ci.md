The 2010 BMW 650i Convertible is a luxurious grand tourer that offers a blend of performance and comfort. It's powered by a 4.8-liter V8 engine that produces 360 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque. While there were not other engine options available in the 2010 650i, it was offered with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's stylish design, powerful engine, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints revolve around the car's higher maintenance costs, complex electronics, and occasional reliability issues.

**Engine**

**4.8L N62 V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a fairly common issue on the N62 engine. These leaks often occur from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and the alternator bracket gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets. Valve cover gaskets often require replacing the bolts as well since they are aluminum.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the location of the leak and if you are doing one or multiple components at a time.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from the coolant transfer pipe that runs underneath the intake manifold. The pipe is made of aluminum, and the seals can degrade over time. Symptoms include low coolant level, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the coolant transfer pipe and associated seals. This requires removing the intake manifold, and can be a complex repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Stem Seals**
    *   Description/Symptoms: As the N62 engine ages, the valve stem seals can harden and crack, leading to oil consumption. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust upon startup, especially after the car has been sitting for a while.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve stem seals. This is a labor-intensive job as it requires removing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 6-speed automatic transmission, including slipping between gears or harsh shifting. This can be caused by worn transmission fluid, faulty solenoids, or internal damage to the transmission.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, further diagnosis and repair may be needed, such as replacing solenoids or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $4000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 650i is equipped with Active Roll Stabilization, which can experience failures. Symptoms include excessive body roll during cornering, warning lights on the dashboard, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty ARS components, such as the hydraulic actuators or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per actuator
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Adaptive Drive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the adaptive drive system which includes Electronic Damper Control (EDC) can lead to a rough ride or inability to adjust the suspension settings.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty EDC shocks, sensors, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per shock plus labor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many BMW owners experience excessive battery drain, which can lead to a dead battery if the car sits for an extended period. This can be caused by various factors, such as a faulty voltage regulator, parasitic draw from electrical components, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the battery drain using a multimeter. Repair or replace the faulty components causing the drain. Register a new battery with the car's computer system after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (battery replacement) - $500+ (diagnosing and repairing electrical issues)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **iDrive System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system can experience various issues, such as freezing, crashing, or displaying error messages. This can be caused by software glitches or hardware failures.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the iDrive system. If the problem persists, software updates or component replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the repair needed
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Malfunctions (Convertible Models)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The convertible top mechanism can experience malfunctions, such as getting stuck in the open or closed position. This can be caused by faulty motors, sensors, or hydraulic components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the convertible top mechanism, including replacing faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the repair needed
    * Recalls: None Found

The 2010 BMW 650i offers a desirable blend of performance and luxury, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues that can arise with age. Engine oil and coolant leaks are fairly common and can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, particularly battery drain and iDrive malfunctions, are also prevalent. Suspension issues, especially with the Active Roll Stabilization system, can lead to expensive repairs. While some issues are minor, others can be more severe and require significant investment to resolve. Overall, the 2010 BMW 650i can be an enjoyable vehicle to own, but it's essential to factor in the potential maintenance and repair costs before making a purchase.
