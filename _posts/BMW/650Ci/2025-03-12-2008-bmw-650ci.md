Leaks often originate from the valve cover gaskets, the alternator bracket gasket, the oil filter housing gasket, or the timing cover seals. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal. Sometimes, the entire valve cover may need replacement if it is warped or cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are common due to aging plastic components in the cooling system. Expansion tanks, radiator hoses, and the water pump are known failure points. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking component(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the location and component.
