The 2014 BMW 328i GT xDrive is a Gran Turismo variant of the popular 3 Series, offering a hatchback design for increased cargo space and versatility. The most common engine in this model is the 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (N20 engine), which produces 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A less common engine option is the 3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6 (N55 engine), found in the 335i GT xDrive, which delivers 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 328i GT xDrive for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and practical hatchback design. However, some common complaints include the vehicle's heavier weight compared to the standard 3 Series, leading to slightly reduced agility, and the potential for various electrical and mechanical issues as the car ages.
