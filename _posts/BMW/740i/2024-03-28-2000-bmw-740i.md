**Introduction:** The 2000 BMW 740i is a luxury sedan that offers a smooth ride and impressive performance. It is powered by a 4.4L V8 engine that produces 282 horsepower and 324 lb-ft of torque. The 740i comes with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission. People like the 740i for its spacious interior, comfortable seats, and powerful engine. However, some common issues have been reported with this vehicle.

**Engine**

**4.4L V8**

- **VANOS system failure:** The VANOS system controls the timing of the engine's valves. If it fails, the engine may lose power or stall. Replacement of the VANOS system is necessary, which costs around $1,500 - $2,000+.
- **Intake manifold gasket leak:** The intake manifold gasket can leak, causing vacuum leaks and a decrease in engine performance. Replacing the intake manifold gasket costs approximately $300-$500.
- **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to jump or break. This can lead to catastrophic engine damage. Replacing the timing chain tensioner costs around $1,000 - $1,500+.
- **Crankshaft position sensor failure:** The crankshaft position sensor tells the engine's computer when to fire the spark plugs. If it fails, the engine may misfire or stall. Replacing the crankshaft position sensor costs about $200-$300.
- **Valve cover gasket leak:** The valve cover gasket can leak, causing oil leaks and a decrease in engine performance. Replacing the valve cover gasket costs approximately $200-$300.

**Transmission**

**5-speed automatic**

- **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip when shifting gears, causing a loss of power or acceleration. Repairing the transmission by replacing worn components or rebuilding the transmission can cost around $1,500 - $3,000+.

**6-speed manual**

- **Clutch failure:** The clutch may wear out over time, causing difficulty shifting gears or slipping. Replacing the clutch costs approximately $800 - $1,200.
- **Gear synchronization issues:** The gear synchronization system may fail, making it difficult or impossible to shift gears. Repairing the gear synchronization system costs around $500 - $1,000.

**Suspension**

- **Strut mount failure:** The strut mounts can wear out over time, causing a clunking noise when driving over bumps. Replacing the strut mounts costs approximately $400 - $600.
- **Control arm bushing failure:** The control arm bushings can wear out over time, causing a clunking noise when driving over bumps. Replacing the control arm bushings costs around $200-$400.
- **Rear differential mount failure:** The rear differential mount can wear out over time, causing a clunking noise when driving over bumps. Replacing the rear differential mount costs approximately $300 - $500.

**Electrical**

- **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to discharge and the vehicle to stall. Replacing the alternator costs approximately $500 - $700.
- **Battery failure:** The battery can fail over time, causing the vehicle to not start. Replacing the battery costs around $200-$300.
- **Starter failure:** The starter can fail, causing the vehicle to not start. Replacing the starter costs approximately $300 - $500.
