**Summary**

The 2014 BMW 740i offers a luxurious driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine oil leaks, particularly in the V8 models, and electrical problems with the iDrive system and battery drain are frequent concerns. Suspension issues related to the air suspension can also be costly. While the inline-6 engine is generally more reliable than the V8, it's not immune to problems like oil filter housing gasket leaks and VANOS issues. Transmission problems, such as mechatronic sleeve leaks, can affect the overall driving experience. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major engine or suspension overhauls. Pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW mechanic is highly recommended.
