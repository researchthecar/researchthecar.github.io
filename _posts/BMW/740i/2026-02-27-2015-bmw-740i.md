### Summary Verdict
The 2015 BMW 740i presents a generally solid reliability record, particularly for its powertrain. The 3.0L inline-six engine and 8-speed automatic transmission are robust. However, potential owners should be aware of specific issues that can arise, primarily related to the advanced suspension systems (air suspension compressor, active roll stabilization) and certain electrical components within the infotainment and keyless entry systems. Turbocharger wastegate actuators and PCV systems on the engine are also points to monitor. While not indicative of universal failure, these are the most commonly cited technical concerns that may require attention and associated repair costs.
