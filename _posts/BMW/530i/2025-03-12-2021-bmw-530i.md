The 2021 BMW 530i is a popular luxury sedan known for its blend of performance, comfort, and technology. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Other available engine options include a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six in the 540i, a plug-in hybrid option in the 530e, and a high-performance twin-turbo V8 in the M550i. All 2021 530i models are equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often praise the 530i for its smooth ride, agile handling, and upscale interior, but some criticisms include the sometimes-confusing iDrive infotainment system and the cost of maintenance and repairs.
