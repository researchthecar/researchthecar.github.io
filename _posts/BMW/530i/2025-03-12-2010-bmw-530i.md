The 2010 BMW 530i is part of the E60 5-Series generation, known for its blend of performance, luxury, and driver involvement. This generation came with a few different engine options: the 3.0L inline-6 naturally aspirated engine (N52), and the 4.8L V8 engine (N62). For transmissions, there was the 6-speed manual, and a 6-speed automatic. The 3.0L inline-6 (N52) produced around 270 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the 530i for its engaging driving dynamics, comfortable ride, and elegant interior. Common dislikes include the higher cost of maintenance, the complexity of the iDrive system, and the potential for electrical gremlins.
