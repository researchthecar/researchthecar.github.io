### Summary Verdict
The 2007 BMW 530i (E60) offers a blend of performance and luxury, but potential owners should be aware of common reliability concerns. The N52 inline-six engine, while generally robust, can suffer from oil leaks due to aging gaskets and PCV system issues. Automatic transmissions may develop leaks or electronic control unit problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also known to wear. Electrically, the iDrive system can be prone to glitches, and the electric water pump is a common failure point. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, issues like clogged sunroof drains and HVAC blower motor failures can occur. Proactive maintenance and addressing these known issues can help ensure a more reliable ownership experience.
