The 2007 BMW 530i is a mid-size luxury sedan that was praised for its driving dynamics, comfortable ride, and stylish design. The 530i came standard with a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (N52B30) producing 255 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2007 5-Series included the 525i (215 hp), 535i (300 hp), 550i (360 hp), and the diesel-powered 535d (265 hp, not available in all markets). Transmission options were a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the car's handling, the smoothness of the inline-6, and the luxurious interior. However, potential downsides include relatively high maintenance costs and the complexity of the car's electronics, which can lead to issues.
