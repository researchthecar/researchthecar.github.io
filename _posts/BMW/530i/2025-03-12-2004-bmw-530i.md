The 2004 BMW 530i (E60 chassis) is a mid-size luxury sedan that offered a blend of performance, comfort, and style. It was praised for its handling, smooth ride, and driver-centric interior. However, some owners found the iDrive system complex and reliability could be a concern with certain components. The 530i specifically came with a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (M54 engine) producing 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the E60 5-Series included a 2.5-liter inline-6 (525i), a 4.4-liter V8 (545i) and later a 4.8-liter V8 (550i). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2004 BMW 530i, while a desirable car for its driving dynamics, can present a number of reliability issues as it ages. Engine oil leaks and cooling system problems are common and can lead to costly repairs if neglected. Electrical issues, particularly with the iDrive system and battery drain, can be frustrating. Suspension components, like control arm bushings, are also prone to wear. The 6-speed automatic transmission has its own set of potential issues with the valve body. Depending on the severity, the costs to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
