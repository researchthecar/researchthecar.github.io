### Summary Verdict
The 2004 BMW 530i (E60) is a capable luxury sedan, but its age means certain components are prone to failure. The inline-six engine is generally robust, but cooling system components and gaskets are common wear items. Automatic transmissions can develop leaks or torque converter issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings and sway bar links are typical for a car of this mileage. Electrically, window regulators, headlight ballasts, and the ABS/DSC module are known weak points. Interior issues often involve the pixelated displays and HVAC blower resistors. While not a maintenance nightmare, potential owners should budget for repairs related to these common issues to maintain reliability.
