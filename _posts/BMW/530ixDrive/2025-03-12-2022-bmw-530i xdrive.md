The 2022 BMW 530i xDrive is a popular luxury sedan known for its blend of performance, comfort, and technology. Its standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2022 5-Series include a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (540i/xDrive) and a plug-in hybrid variant combining the 2.0-liter turbo-4 with an electric motor (530e/xDrive). All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the 530i xDrive for its refined driving experience, comfortable interior, and advanced technology features. Common dislikes revolve around the sometimes-complicated iDrive infotainment system and the cost of maintenance and repairs.
