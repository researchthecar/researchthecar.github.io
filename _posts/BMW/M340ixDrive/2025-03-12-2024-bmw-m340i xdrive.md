The 2024 BMW M340i xDrive is a popular sports sedan praised for its blend of performance and luxury. It features a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine producing 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The M340i exclusively uses an 8-speed automatic transmission. While other 3 Series models offer different engine and drivetrain configurations (such as the 330i with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder), the M340i xDrive stands out for its performance focus. People generally appreciate its strong acceleration, agile handling, and premium interior, but some criticisms include a somewhat firm ride and limited rear headroom.
