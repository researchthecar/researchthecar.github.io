### Summary Verdict
The 2008 BMW 335i is a desirable performance car, but its N54 engine is known for specific, albeit often repairable, issues. The high-pressure fuel system (HPFP, injectors) and turbocharger components are the most common areas of concern, requiring significant investment when they fail. Transmission reliability is generally good for the manual, while the automatic can experience issues with the mechatronic unit and torque converter. Electrical components, particularly the electric water pump, are also a notable point of attention. While the chassis, suspension, exterior, and interior are generally robust, potential buyers should be aware of and budget for the engine and transmission-related repairs that are characteristic of this model.
