The automatic transmission can suffer from mechatronic sleeve leaks. Suspension issues are typical with age. Electrical issues are fairly common due to the complex electronics of the car. Repair costs can be significant, particularly for engine and transmission-related problems, making it important to thoroughly inspect any prospective purchase and budget for potential maintenance.
