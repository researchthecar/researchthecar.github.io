### Summary Verdict
The 2009 BMW 335i is a performance-oriented sedan with a generally solid chassis and interior. However, the complexity of its N54 twin-turbocharged engine introduces specific reliability concerns, most notably with the high-pressure fuel pump, wastegates, and fuel injectors. The N55 engine variant is generally considered more reliable. Electrical issues like water pump failures are also notable. While the manual and automatic transmissions are typically robust, potential buyers should be prepared for the possibility of significant repair costs associated with the engine's advanced components. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for mitigating these issues.
