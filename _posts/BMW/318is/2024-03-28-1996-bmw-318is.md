**Introduction:**

The 1996 BMW 318is is a compact luxury sedan powered by a 1.8-liter inline-four engine that produces 138 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a standard five-speed manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic transmission. The 318is is known for its agile handling, comfortable interior, and reliable performance. However, it has also been plagued by several common issues over the years.

**Engine:**

**1.8-Liter M42 Engine**

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket, causing an oil burning smell and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a burning oil smell, low oil levels, and oil residue under the valve cover. The fix involves replacing the valve cover gasket. Estimated cost: $200 - $500+.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to slip or break. Symptoms include engine misfires, rough idling, and potential engine damage. The fix involves replacing the timing chain tensioner and timing chain. Estimated cost: $1,500 - $2,000+.

**Transmission:**

**Five-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Clutch Master Cylinder Failure:** The clutch master cylinder can fail, causing the clutch to disengage and making it difficult or impossible to shift gears. Symptoms include a spongy clutch pedal, difficulty shifting gears, and potential clutch damage. The fix involves replacing the clutch master cylinder. Estimated cost: $300 - $600+.
* **Input Shaft Seal Leak:** The input shaft seal can leak, causing transmission fluid to leak out. Symptoms include low transmission fluid levels, a leak under the transmission, and potential transmission damage. The fix involves replacing the input shaft seal. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+.

**Four-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Fluid Leak:** The transmission fluid pan gasket or other seals can leak, causing transmission fluid to leak out. Symptoms include low transmission fluid levels, a leak under the transmission, and potential transmission damage. The fix involves replacing the leaky gasket or seal. Estimated cost: $200 - $500+.
* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** The shift solenoids can fail, causing transmission shifting issues. Symptoms include delayed or harsh shifting, slipping gears, and potential transmission damage. The fix involves replacing the faulty shift solenoid. Estimated cost: $300 - $800+.

**Suspension:**

* **Front Control Arm Bushings Wear:** The front control arm bushings can wear out, causing a clunking or rattling noise when driving over bumps. Symptoms include a clunking noise when driving over bumps, uneven tire wear, and potential suspension damage. The fix involves replacing the worn control arm bushings. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+.

**Electrical:**

* **Window Regulator Failure:** The window regulators can fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. Symptoms include windows that are stuck in place or that move slowly or erratically. The fix involves replacing the faulty window regulator. Estimated cost: $200 - $500+.
* **Central Locking System Failure:** The central locking system can fail, causing the doors to become inoperable. Symptoms include doors that are stuck locked or unlocked, or that lock or unlock erratically. The fix involves diagnosing and repairing the faulty component in the central locking system. Estimated cost: $100 - $400+.

**Exterior:**

* **Power Antenna Failure:** The power antenna can fail, causing the antenna to become stuck in the up or down position. Symptoms include a non-functioning antenna, poor radio reception, and potential damage to the antenna. The fix involves replacing the faulty power antenna. Estimated cost: $100 - $300+.

**Interior:**

* **Dashboard Pixel Failure:** The dashboard pixels can fail, causing the dashboard display to become unreadable. Symptoms include missing or scrambled pixels on the dashboard display. The fix involves replacing the faulty display. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+.
* **Air Conditioning Blower Motor Resistor Failure:** The air conditioning blower motor resistor can fail, causing the air conditioning blower to stop working. Symptoms include no air flow from the air conditioning vents, or only high-speed air flow. The fix involves replacing the faulty blower motor resistor. Estimated cost: $100 - $300+.

**Summary:**

The 1996 BMW 318is is a reliable and fun-to-drive car, but it is not without its problems. Some of the most common issues include valve cover and timing chain tensioner failures, transmission fluid leaks, suspension bushing wear, electrical problems, and interior component failures. The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the specific issue, but some can be quite expensive to repair. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues before purchasing a 1996 BMW 318is.
