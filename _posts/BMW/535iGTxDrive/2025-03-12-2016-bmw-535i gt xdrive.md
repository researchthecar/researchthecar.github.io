The 2016 BMW 535i GT xDrive is a luxury hatchback known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. While offering a blend of practicality and performance, it's not without its potential issues. The 535i GT xDrive comes equipped with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options for the 5 Series GT include the 550i models with a 4.4L V8 engine. Owners often praise the car's luxurious features, ample rear legroom, and refined driving experience. However, potential downsides include higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles, complex electronics that can be prone to glitches, and the unique hatchback design, which might not appeal to everyone.
