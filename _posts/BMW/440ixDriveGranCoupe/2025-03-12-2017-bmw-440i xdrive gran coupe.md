The 2017 BMW 440i xDrive Gran Coupe is a stylish and sporty four-door coupe that offers a blend of performance and practicality. It's powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine (B58) producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 4 Series Gran Coupe include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (B48) in the 430i models. All 2017 440i xDrive Gran Coupe models came standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission, although a 6-speed manual was available on RWD models. Owners often praise the 440i for its smooth and powerful engine, agile handling, and refined interior. However, some common complaints include the run-flat tires' harsh ride, the iDrive infotainment system's complexity (though generally regarded as user-friendly), and potential reliability issues as the car ages.
