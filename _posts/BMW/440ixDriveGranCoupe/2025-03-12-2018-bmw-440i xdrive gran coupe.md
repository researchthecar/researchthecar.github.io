The 2018 BMW 440i xDrive Gran Coupe is a stylish and sporty four-door coupe that blends practicality with driving enjoyment. It is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options in the 4 Series Gran Coupe line include the 430i with a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four. Both engines are typically paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, though a 6-speed manual was briefly available. Owners often praise the 440i for its strong acceleration, comfortable ride, and attractive styling. Common complaints revolve around higher maintenance costs, some electrical gremlins, and the run-flat tires that contribute to a harsher ride on rough roads.
