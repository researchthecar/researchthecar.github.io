The 2010 BMW 335d is a diesel-powered variant of the popular E90 3-Series. It offers a unique blend of performance and fuel economy, appealing to drivers who appreciate a torquey engine and a more refined driving experience. The 335d boasts approximately 265 horsepower and a stout 425 lb-ft of torque. While offering excellent performance, the 335d, like many BMWs of this era, is known for its complexity and potential for costly repairs.
