## Engine

### 3.0L M57 Twin-Turbo Diesel
**Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Check engine light, reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, rough idling.
- **Solution:** Forced regeneration, DPF cleaning, or replacement. Software updates may also address regeneration cycles.
- **Cost:** $300 - $1500 (cleaning/regeneration) / $1000 - $3000 (replacement)
