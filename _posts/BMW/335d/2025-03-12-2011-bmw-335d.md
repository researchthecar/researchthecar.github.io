The 2011 BMW 335d is a diesel-powered variant of the popular E90 3-Series. It's praised for its impressive torque, fuel economy (for a performance car), and overall driving experience. Some downsides include the higher cost of maintenance associated with BMWs, especially diesels with their complex emissions systems. The 335d came exclusively with a 3.0-liter inline-six diesel engine producing 265 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque, and only came with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Other 3-Series models in 2011 offered gasoline engines such as the 3.0-liter inline-six in the 328i and 335i, as well as a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission depending on the model.

**Engine**

**3.0L Inline-Six Diesel (M57)**

*   **Swirl Flap Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The swirl flaps inside the intake manifold can break off and get ingested into the engine, causing catastrophic damage. Symptoms include rough running, loss of power, and unusual engine noises.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold with an updated version or delete the swirl flaps altogether, followed by a tune to ensure proper engine operation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on whether flaps are deleted or manifold replaced, and if any engine damage occurred)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits, leading to poor engine performance, reduced fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, especially with frequent short trips. This leads to reduced engine performance, the DPF light illuminating, and potential limp mode.
    *   Solution: Attempt a forced regeneration of the DPF (done by a mechanic) or replace the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (for forced regeneration) - $1500+ (for DPF replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Line Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 335d uses vacuum lines to control various components, including the turbochargers. These lines can crack and leak over time, causing a loss of boost, reduced performance, and diagnostic trouble codes.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty vacuum lines.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (GM 6L45)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering, slipping, and poor shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter or rebuild the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit (transmission control unit) can experience electrical or hydraulic failures, leading to erratic shifting, limp mode, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the Mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises, imprecise steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ (depending on which control arms need replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking or worn struts and shocks can lead to a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ (depending on brand and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Glow plugs help start the engine in cold weather. Failure can result in hard starting or no starting in cold conditions.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty glow plugs and potentially the glow plug control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur due to faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.

**Summary**

The 2011 BMW 335d, while offering a compelling driving experience, can be prone to specific issues related to its diesel engine and associated components. The most concerning issues involve the swirl flaps and the DPF, as they can lead to significant engine damage and costly repairs. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can also be expensive to address. Suspension and electrical problems are more common and less severe, but still require attention. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their budget, and ensure a thorough inspection is performed before purchase.
