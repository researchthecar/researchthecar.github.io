The 2020 BMW 530e is a plug-in hybrid variant of the popular 5 Series sedan, blending efficiency with BMW's signature driving dynamics. It features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 248 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2020 5 Series include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (non-hybrid), a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6, and a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8, each with increasing levels of performance. All 2020 5 Series models use an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 530e for its fuel economy, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. Some criticisms include the smaller trunk space due to the hybrid battery pack and the sometimes abrupt transitions between electric and gasoline power.
