The 2021 BMW 530e is a plug-in hybrid variant of the popular 5-Series sedan. It combines a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 288 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2021 5-Series include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (530i), a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six (540i), and a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (M550i). All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the 530e's blend of performance, fuel efficiency, and luxury. Common criticisms include the limited all-electric range and the higher price compared to non-hybrid models.
