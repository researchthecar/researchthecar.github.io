The 2023 BMW iX is an all-electric SUV that combines luxury, performance, and innovative technology. Available in two main configurations, the xDrive50 and the M60, the iX boasts impressive power and range. The xDrive50 delivers around 516 horsepower and 564 lb-ft of torque, while the M60 bumps that up to 610 horsepower and 749 lb-ft of torque in Sport Mode. Owners often praise the iX for its comfortable ride, spacious and modern interior, and the impressive acceleration typical of electric vehicles. However, some criticisms include the polarizing exterior styling, the complexity of the infotainment system, and certain software glitches.
