The 2018 BMW 430i xDrive Gran Coupe is a stylish and practical four-door coupe, offering a blend of sporty handling and everyday usability. The 430i xDrive Gran Coupe is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Another engine option is the 440i which is powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Both engine options are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the car's sleek design, comfortable interior, and agile driving dynamics. However, some common complaints include reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system, and the relatively high cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (B46/B48)**

*   **Oil Leaks from Valve Cover Gasket**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue on BMW engines, and the 2.0L turbo is no exception. The valve cover gasket can degrade over time, leading to oil leaks onto the exhaust manifold, potentially causing a burning smell and visible oil drips.

**Summary**

The 2018 BMW 430i xDrive Gran Coupe, while a desirable vehicle in terms of aesthetics and driving experience, does present some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine oil leaks and coolant leaks are prevalent. Electrical issues, such as iDrive malfunctions and battery drain, can be frustrating. Suspension components, like control arm bushings, are susceptible to wear and tear. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more costly, potentially exceeding $1,000 or more. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW mechanic to identify any potential problems before making a purchase.
