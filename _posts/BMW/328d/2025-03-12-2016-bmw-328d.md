The 2016 BMW 328d is a popular choice for those seeking a blend of fuel efficiency and BMW's sporty driving dynamics. It features a 2.0-liter turbocharged diesel engine producing 180 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2016 3 Series include the 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine in the 320i and 328i, the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 in the 340i, and a hybrid option. The standard transmission for the 328d is an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the car's fuel economy, handling, and overall build quality. Common complaints include the cost of maintenance and repairs, occasional electrical glitches, and the sometimes-stiff ride, especially with the sport suspension.

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW 328d is a generally reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine issues, particularly related to the EGR cooler and timing chain, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, while less frequent, can also be expensive. Electrical glitches and suspension wear are also areas to inspect. The overall cost of ownership can be higher than some competitors due to potentially expensive repairs. While some issues are more prevalent in earlier model years or with higher mileage, pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended.
