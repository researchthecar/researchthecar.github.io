The 2015 BMW 328d is a popular diesel variant of the F30 3 Series, known for its fuel efficiency and respectable performance. The 328d is equipped with a 2.0-liter inline-4 turbocharged diesel engine producing 180 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. It was available in both rear-wheel drive (RWD) and all-wheel drive (xDrive) configurations. Other engine options for the 2015 3 Series included various gasoline engines (320i, 328i, 335i/340i). People generally appreciate the 328d for its combination of fuel economy and torque, making it a good daily driver. Some common dislikes include the typical BMW maintenance costs and potential diesel-specific issues related to emissions systems.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Turbocharged Diesel (N47/B47)**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, potential engine overheating, check engine light. The EGR cooler is prone to cracking and leaking coolant into the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, frequent regeneration cycles, DPF warning light. This is more common with short trip driving where the DPF cannot reach the temperature required for complete regeneration.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (if possible), DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (forced regeneration) - $2000+ (DPF replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues (Primarily affects N47 engine pre-2015)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the rear of the engine (timing chain location), especially on cold starts. In severe cases, timing chain failure can cause significant engine damage. While less prevalent in 2015 models which use the updated B47 engine, it's still possible.
    *   Solution: Timing chain replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 8HP Automatic Transmission**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, transmission malfunction warning light. The valve body contains solenoids and valves that control the flow of transmission fluid, and wear or failure of these components can cause shifting problems.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Sleeve Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid leak, usually noticeable as drips under the car, especially near the transmission. Can also cause shifting issues if fluid level is low. The mechatronic sleeve seals the connection between the transmission wiring harness and the valve body.
    *   Solution: Mechatronic sleeve replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Cracked Front Lower Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Decreased steering precision.
    *   Solution: Front lower control arm replacement, bushings can be replaced by themselves but often the control arm comes as a complete unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits for several days. Difficulty starting the car. This can be caused by various issues, including a faulty alternator, parasitic drain from an electrical component, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the battery drain, which may involve testing the alternator, checking for parasitic draws, or replacing the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)

**Summary**

The 2015 BMW 328d, while generally a reliable and fuel-efficient vehicle, does have some common issues that owners should be aware of.
