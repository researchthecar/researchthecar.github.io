It was available as a sedan and wagon (Touring) body style. The 328d is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine, producing 180 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2017 3 Series included the 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline four-cylinder (320i and 330i), a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six gasoline engine (340i), and a hybrid option (330e). The 328d came standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and could be configured with xDrive all-wheel drive. Owners generally praised the 328d for its excellent fuel economy, torquey engine, and comfortable ride. Common complaints often revolved around higher maintenance costs associated with BMWs in general, as well as specific issues related to the diesel emissions systems.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbo Diesel (N47/B47)**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks in the EGR cooler can develop, leading to coolant leaks and potential exhaust gas recirculation issues. White smoke from the exhaust is often seen. Can cause a fire in rare cases.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler assembly. Newer revisions of the cooler are available which address the design flaws in the earlier versions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: 18V-755, 19V-672, 20V-021

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF, designed to trap soot from the exhaust, can become clogged, particularly with frequent short trips that don't allow for proper regeneration. Symptoms include reduced engine power, poor fuel economy, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF by a BMW dealership or qualified mechanic. In severe cases, DPF replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500 for forced regeneration, $1500-$3000+ for DPF replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficult cold starts, rough idling, and a check engine light can all be signs of failing glow plugs.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty glow plug(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP45/50)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifting, especially between certain gears. This can sometimes be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Software update of the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can help. For more severe cases, valve body replacement or full transmission rebuild/replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for software update, $300 - $600 for fluid change, $1500 - $4000+ for valve body or transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Sleeve Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks can develop around the mechatronic sealing sleeve where the wiring harness enters the transmission. This can lead to low transmission fluid levels and potential transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the mechatronic sleeve and fluid service.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. It can also affect handling and steering precision.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the complete control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can occur due to various parasitic draws on the electrical system. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the source of the parasitic draw by a qualified technician, and repair or replacement of the faulty component. Common culprits include faulty comfort access modules, improperly shut-down infotainment systems, or aftermarket electronics.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable depending on the cause. Could range from $100 for a simple fix to $1000+ for more complex electrical repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can sometimes experience glitches, freezes, or complete failures. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.

**Summary**

The 2017 BMW 328d, while generally a reliable car, can suffer from a few common issues, particularly related to its diesel emissions system and transmission. The EGR cooler failures and DPF clogs are the most concerning engine-related problems, and the transmission can be prone to rough shifting if not properly maintained. Electrical issues are also a possibility, but their repair costs can vary greatly. Most of these repairs range from moderate to fairly expensive, reflecting the typical maintenance costs associated with BMWs. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and ensure the car has been well-maintained before purchasing. The EGR cooler is a particularly important point due to the fire risk, so review the VIN and check if the recall work has been performed.
