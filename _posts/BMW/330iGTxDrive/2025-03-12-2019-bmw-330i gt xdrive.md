The 2019 BMW 330i GT xDrive is a sporty and practical hatchback offering a blend of driving pleasure and versatility. It came equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. This generation of the 3 Series GT is generally appreciated for its spacious rear seating, comfortable ride, and ample cargo capacity. However, some common criticisms include its less engaging handling compared to the standard 3 Series sedan and its less stylish exterior design.
