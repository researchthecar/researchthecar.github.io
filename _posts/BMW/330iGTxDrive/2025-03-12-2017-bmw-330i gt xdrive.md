The 2017 BMW 330i GT xDrive is a Gran Turismo variant of the popular 3 Series, offering a more spacious interior and hatchback design compared to the sedan. Its primary engine option is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Summary:**

The 2017 BMW 330i GT xDrive generally offers a comfortable driving experience but is prone to some common issues. Engine oil and coolant leaks are relatively frequent, leading to repair costs ranging from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars. Transmission issues, while not as common, can be more costly, particularly if they require valve body replacement or a complete overhaul. Electrical glitches, such as iDrive malfunctions and battery drain, also contribute to potential repair expenses. While the sunroof and adaptive headlight issues may occur, they are less frequent than other common problems. Potential buyers should consider these potential issues and factor in the cost of maintenance and repairs when evaluating the purchase of a used 2017 BMW 330i GT xDrive.
