### Summary Verdict
The 2013 BMW 650i xDrive is a capable luxury coupe, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with its powerful 4.4L twin-turbo V8 engine. Issues such as turbocharger problems, fuel injector failures, and valve stem seal wear are documented and can lead to significant repair costs. The transmission and exterior/interior components generally show good reliability. Electrical gremlins, especially with the iDrive system and parasitic battery drain, can also arise. While the xDrive system itself is robust, the adaptive suspension components can be a source of expense. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for managing the long-term ownership costs of this performance-oriented vehicle.
