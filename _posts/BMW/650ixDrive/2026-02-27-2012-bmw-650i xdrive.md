### Summary Verdict
The 2012 BMW 650i xDrive is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but its complex twin-turbocharged V8 engine presents the most significant reliability concerns. Issues such as turbocharger oil leaks, fuel injector failures, and valve stem seal wear are not uncommon and can be costly to repair. The transmission and most other systems, including suspension, electrical components (though iDrive can have glitches), exterior, and interior, are generally reliable. Prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for high maintenance costs associated with the engine, particularly if the vehicle has not been meticulously maintained. Thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
