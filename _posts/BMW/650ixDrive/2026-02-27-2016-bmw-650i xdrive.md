### Summary Verdict
The 2016 BMW 650i xDrive is a powerful and luxurious vehicle with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The 4.4L twin-turbo V8 engine, while potent, has some documented potential issues related to its turbochargers, ignition coils, and fuel injectors, which can be costly to repair. The 8-speed automatic transmission is considered reliable. The adaptive suspension system, particularly the active roll stabilization, can be a source of expensive repairs if it malfunctions. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive software glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted concerns. While the exterior and interior components are typically robust, the complexity of the powertrain and advanced systems means potential buyers should budget for potential maintenance and repairs beyond standard wear and tear.
