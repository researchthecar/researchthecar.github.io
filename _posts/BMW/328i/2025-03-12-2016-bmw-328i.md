The 2016 BMW 328i (also sometimes referred to as the 320i, 330i, 340i depending on the engine configuration) is a popular luxury sedan known for its sporty handling and refined interior. The 328i specifically features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 240 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2016 3 Series included a less powerful 2.0-liter turbo-4 in the 320i, a more powerful updated version in the 330i, a turbocharged inline-6 in the 340i and a diesel inline-4 in the 328d. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 328i for its driving dynamics, fuel efficiency (especially with the inline-4), and upscale feel. Common complaints include the cost of maintenance, potential for electrical gremlins, and some find the ride quality a bit firm for long journeys.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (N20/B48)**

*   **Oil Leaks (N20 Engine Pre-facelift)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, particularly from the valve cover gasket and the oil filter housing gasket. Symptoms include oil puddles under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the source of the leak and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues (N20 Engine Pre-facelift)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The N20 engine (pre-LCI/facelift) can experience timing chain guide failure, leading to a loose or broken timing chain. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and potential engine damage if ignored.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioner is required. In severe cases, engine damage may necessitate more extensive repairs or even engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**
*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report rough shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or hesitation when accelerating. This can be caused by worn valve body components or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for fluid flush and filter change; $1,500 - $4,000+ for valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Broken Front Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of front coil springs breaking, especially in areas with harsh winters and road salt. Symptoms include a clunking noise from the front suspension and uneven ride height.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken coil spring(s) and potentially the struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per spring depending on labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can occur due to a variety of issues, including the car not fully going to sleep, a faulty control module, or a parasitic draw from an aftermarket accessory. Symptoms include a dead battery, difficulty starting the car, and warning messages on the instrument cluster.
    * Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic drain, replacing the battery, and/or updating software.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for a new battery; $100 - $1,000+ for diagnosing and repairing electrical issues depending on the complexity.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Fuel Level Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel level sensor can fail, resulting in an inaccurate fuel gauge reading.
    *   Solution: Replacing the fuel level sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight. This is more common in warmer climates.

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW 328i, while offering a sporty and luxurious driving experience, can be prone to certain issues. The most concerning are the engine-related problems like oil leaks and timing chain issues (particularly in the N20 engine), which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins and suspension component failures are also relatively common. While some issues, like battery drain, might have simple solutions, others, like timing chain replacement, can represent a significant financial burden. Buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for any signs of these issues before purchase, and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW mechanic is highly recommended.
