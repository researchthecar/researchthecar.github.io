### Summary Verdict
The 2008 BMW 328i (E90) offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but like many German luxury cars of its era, it can present specific reliability concerns. The 3.0L N52 inline-six engine, while generally robust, is prone to oil leaks from the valve cover and oil pan gaskets, as well as potential PCV system issues. The automatic transmission can sometimes suffer from mechatronic unit or torque converter problems. Suspension components, particularly control arm bushings and strut mounts, may require attention. Electrical gremlins like failing window regulators and HVAC resistors are also noted. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and addressing problems promptly, the 328i can remain a rewarding vehicle to own.
