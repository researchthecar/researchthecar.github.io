The 2011 BMW 328i is a popular luxury sedan known for its engaging driving dynamics and refined styling. The model is offered with two primary engine options: the 3.0L inline-6 naturally aspirated N52 engine, producing 230 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.0L inline-6 turbocharged N55 engine that produces 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque, which is typically found on the 335i. The 328i only received the N52. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 328i for its responsive handling, comfortable interior, and overall driving experience. However, some common complaints include the cost of maintenance, electrical issues, and certain engine-related problems.

**Engine**

**N52 3.0L Inline-6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue on the N52 engine, particularly from the valve cover gasket. This can lead to a burning oil smell, visible oil leaks on the engine, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gasket is the standard fix. It's often recommended to replace the valve cover itself as the plastic can warp over time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Housing Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil filter housing gasket can also leak, causing oil to drip onto the engine and other components. Similar to the valve cover gasket, this can cause a burning oil smell and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil filter housing gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VANOS (Variable Camshaft Timing) solenoids can fail, leading to rough idling, decreased power, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty VANOS solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**GM 6L45R 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Mechatronic Sleeve Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic sleeve, where the wiring harness enters the transmission, can leak fluid. This can cause transmission issues and slipping.
    *   Solution: Replace the mechatronic sleeve and fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Manual Transmissions**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front control arm bushings, particularly the hydraulic bushings, are prone to wear and tear. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners report issues with battery drain, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including a faulty voltage regulator, parasitic drain from aftermarket electronics, or a failing IBS (Intelligent Battery Sensor) sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the drain and replacing the faulty component. This might involve testing the alternator, battery, IBS, and other electrical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Steering Wheel Lock Issue**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sometimes the steering wheel lock system malfunctions, causing the steering wheel to get stuck and the car to not start. This is sometimes related to the electronic steering lock (ESL) module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and possible replacement of the ESL module or related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The window regulators, which control the raising and lowering of the windows, can fail, resulting in the window becoming stuck or not operating properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof can become stuck, noisy, or fail to open or close correctly. This can be due to broken guides, a faulty motor, or debris in the mechanism.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks, replacing broken parts, or replacing the sunroof motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+ depending on the issue
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 BMW 328i is a generally reliable vehicle but is not without its potential problems. Engine oil leaks (valve cover and oil filter housing gaskets) and suspension component wear are common issues. Electrical issues, such as battery drain, can also occur. The severity of these issues varies, but the cost of repair can be significant, especially when performed by a BMW specialist. Owners should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into the overall cost of ownership.
