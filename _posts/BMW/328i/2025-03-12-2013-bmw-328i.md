The 2013 BMW 328i (F30 chassis) is a popular compact executive sedan known for its engaging driving dynamics, sporty handling, and refined interior. The most common engine option for the 2013 328i is the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (N20) engine, producing 240 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque. While a capable engine, it's also known for several common issues. The 2013 328i also came with an optional 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (N55) engine in the 335i model, boasting 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the 328i for its blend of performance, fuel efficiency, and luxury. However, some common complaints include reliability concerns, particularly with the N20 engine, as well as relatively high maintenance costs.
