The 2015 BMW 328i is a popular choice among luxury sport sedan enthusiasts, known for its blend of performance, comfort, and style. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (N20) producing 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 3 Series that year included a 3.0-liter inline-6 (N55) in the 335i, and a diesel 2.0-liter inline-4 (N47 or B47 depending on market) in the 328d. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 328i for its responsive handling, fuel efficiency, and upscale interior. However, some common complaints include the cost of maintenance, potential reliability issues with certain components, and the somewhat firm ride quality, especially with the sport suspension options.

Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are additional areas to inspect. While some repairs are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified BMW mechanic are highly recommended to assess the vehicle's condition and identify any potential problems.
