The 2014 BMW 328i is a popular compact executive sedan known for its blend of performance, luxury, and driving dynamics. It comes standard with a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine (N20) producing 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available that year are the 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 cylinder (N55) producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque in the 335i models, and a 2.0L turbo diesel inline-4 cylinder (N47) in the 328d producing 180 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 328i for its responsive handling, fuel efficiency, and upscale interior. Common complaints include reliability issues, relatively high maintenance costs, and some find the ride quality a bit firm, especially with sport suspension options.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (N20)**

* **Timing Chain Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loud rattling noise upon cold start, especially noticeable for a few seconds. Can progress to rough running, misfires, and eventually catastrophic engine damage if the chain breaks. This issue primarily affects N20 engines produced before 2015.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, sprockets, guides, and tensioner. In severe cases, engine damage may necessitate a more extensive repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover, Oil Filter Housing, Oil Pan)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the engine, burning oil smell, low oil level warnings. Valve cover gasket leaks are common due to age and heat cycles. Oil filter housing leaks can develop due to gasket deterioration. Oil pan leaks are often caused by damage or gasket failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets. Oil pan leaks may require resealing the pan or replacing it if damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gasket: $300 - $700, Oil filter housing gasket: $300 - $600, Oil pan gasket: $500 - $1200
    * Recalls: None Found

* **VANOS Solenoid Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, rough idle, hesitation during acceleration, check engine light. VANOS (Variable Valve Timing) solenoids control oil flow to adjust camshaft timing. Failure can disrupt engine timing and performance.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty VANOS solenoid(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6 (N55)**

* **Oil Filter Housing Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the N20, oil leaks, burning oil smell, low oil level warnings.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

* **VANOS Solenoid Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, rough idle, hesitation during acceleration, check engine light. VANOS (Variable Valve Timing) solenoids control oil flow to adjust camshaft timing. Failure can disrupt engine timing and performance.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty VANOS solenoid(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbo Diesel Inline-4 (N47)**

* **Timing Chain Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loud rattling noise upon cold start, especially noticeable for a few seconds. Can progress to rough running, misfires, and eventually catastrophic engine damage if the chain breaks. This issue primarily affects N47 engines produced before 2015.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, sprockets, guides, and tensioner. In severe cases, engine damage may necessitate a more extensive repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (GA8HP45Z)**

* **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, transmission malfunction warnings on the dashboard. The mechatronic unit is the electronic control module within the transmission that controls shifting.
    * Solution: Replacement of the mechatronic unit, or in some cases, rebuilding the valve body within the mechatronic unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Fluid Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible fluid leaks under the vehicle, difficulty shifting, transmission malfunction warnings. Leaks can occur from the pan gasket, seals, or other areas of the transmission.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets and seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Cracked Thrust Arms/Control Arms Bushings**

**Summary**

The 2014 BMW 328i, while enjoyable to drive, has several potential issues to be aware of. The most concerning are the timing chain issues, particularly in the N20 and N47 engines, and the potential for mechatronic unit failure in the 8-speed automatic transmission. These can be costly to repair. Oil leaks are also relatively common across the engine options. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed to assess the condition of these key components. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major engine or transmission failures. The cost to fix can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the repair shop, but some repairs can be quite expensive.
