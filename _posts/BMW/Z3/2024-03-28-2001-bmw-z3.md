**2001 BMW Z3**

The 2001 BMW Z3 is a two-seater roadster that comes with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The 2.5i base model features a 2.5-liter inline-6 engine rated at 170 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0i model gets a 3.0-liter inline-6 that makes 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a standard 5-speed manual transmission, while a 5-speed automatic transmission is offered as an option. The Z3 is praised for its sporty handling, stylish design, and responsive engines, but it has been criticized for its cramped interior and lack of storage space.
