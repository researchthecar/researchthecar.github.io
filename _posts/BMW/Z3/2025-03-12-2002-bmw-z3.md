The 2002 BMW Z3 is a rear-wheel-drive roadster that offers a fun and engaging driving experience. For the 2002 model year, engine options included a 2.5L inline-6 producing 184 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L inline-6 producing 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque, and the high-performance M version with a 3.2L inline-6 producing 315 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consisted of a 5-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic on the 2.5L and 3.0L models, and only a 5-speed manual on the M version. People appreciate the Z3 for its classic roadster styling, nimble handling, and relatively affordable price point. Some common dislikes include the sometimes cramped interior, and the age of the vehicle can lead to increased maintenance needs.

**Summary**
The 2002 BMW Z3, being an older vehicle, is prone to various issues common to its age and design. Engine issues, particularly VANOS and cooling system problems, are relatively common across the different engine options. The M version has the added concern of potential rod bearing failure, which is a more severe and costly repair. Suspension and electrical issues are also frequent, contributing to the overall maintenance burden. While the Z3 remains a desirable roadster, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing and ownership costs. The severity of the issues can range from minor annoyances to significant mechanical problems, with repair costs varying accordingly.
