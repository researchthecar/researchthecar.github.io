The 2001 BMW Z3 is a sporty roadster that offers a fun driving experience. It came with a range of engine options, including the 2.5L M52 inline-6 engine producing 170 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available were the 2.3L inline-4, 2.8L inline-6, and the high-performance M version's 3.2L inline-6. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Z3 for its nimble handling, classic roadster styling, and relatively affordable price point.
