### Summary Verdict
The 2015 BMW 750i is a luxurious and powerful vehicle, but its complexity means potential for costly repairs. The 4.4L twin-turbo V8 is the primary area of concern, with turbocharger issues, fuel injector problems, and significant oil consumption being the most frequently reported. The adaptive suspension can also present expensive repairs if components like air springs or active roll stabilization fail.
