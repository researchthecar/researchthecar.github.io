    * Description/Symptoms: Blue smoke from the exhaust, especially upon start-up after the car has been sitting, indicates oil leaking into the cylinders from deteriorated valve stem seals. Oil consumption may also increase.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve stem seals. This is a labor-intensive job that often involves removing the cylinder heads.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Transfer Pipe Leak (Valley Pan Leak)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak originating from the top of the engine, often collecting in the valley pan under the intake manifold. Can cause overheating and coolant loss.
    * Solution: Replacing the coolant transfer pipe (often referred to as the "valley pan"). This requires significant disassembly of the top of the engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Oil Feed Line Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leak near the turbochargers, often dripping onto hot exhaust components. This can cause a burning smell and, in severe cases, smoke.
    * Solution: Replacing the turbocharger oil feed lines and any associated seals/gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ (per side if both need replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and possible fuel smell. High Pressure Fuel Pumps, or fuel injectors are common failures
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (per injector)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 8HP Automatic Transmission (All Models)**

* **Mechatronic Sleeve Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid leak from the electrical connector sleeve that passes through the transmission housing. Can cause transmission slipping or harsh shifting if fluid level drops too low.
    * Solution: Replacing the mechatronic sleeve and refilling the transmission fluid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly. Often caused by worn solenoids or other components within the valve body.
    * Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body. In some cases, a software update may temporarily alleviate the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the car is sagging or one side of the car is sagging, compressor runs constantly and burns out, and "Self-leveling suspension inactive" warning on the dashboard.
