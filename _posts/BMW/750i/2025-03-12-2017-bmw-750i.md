The 2017 BMW 750i is a luxury sedan that blends performance with opulent comfort. While it boasts advanced technology and a refined driving experience, like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. The 2017 750i comes standard with a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 445 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. While other engine options are available for the 7 Series range in other trims, such as the 740i and 740e, the 750i is exclusively powered by the V8.
