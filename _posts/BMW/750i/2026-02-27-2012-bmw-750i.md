### Summary Verdict
The 2012 BMW 750i is a luxurious and powerful vehicle, but its complexity means potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 4.4L twin-turbo V8 engine is prone to oil leaks from the turbochargers and issues with fuel injectors and ignition components, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmissions, particularly the 6-speed, can experience problems with the mechatronic unit and torque converter. Suspension components, especially those related to the adaptive drive system and air suspension, are also noted for potential failures. Electrical gremlins, often related to the iDrive system or Body Control Module, can also arise. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, the mechanical and electrical systems require diligent maintenance and can incur significant repair costs.
