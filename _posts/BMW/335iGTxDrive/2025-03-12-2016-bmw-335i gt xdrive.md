The 2016 BMW 335i GT xDrive is a Gran Turismo variant of the 3 Series, offering a blend of sportiness and practicality with its hatchback design and increased rear passenger space. The 335i GT xDrive comes equipped with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine (N55) producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some like the car for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and performance, while others dislike its somewhat polarizing styling and higher price compared to a standard 3 Series sedan. It is also offered with the 2.0L inline-4 engine, known as the 328i GT xDrive. The main things that separate it from the standard 3 series models are the cargo room, comfort, and ride quality, but it loses some of the sportiness and agility of the other models.
