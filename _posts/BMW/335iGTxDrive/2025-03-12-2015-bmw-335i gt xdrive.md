The 2015 BMW 335i GT xDrive is a Gran Turismo variant of the 3 Series, offering a more spacious interior and hatchback design. It typically comes equipped with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine (N55B30) producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 3 Series GT in different markets or years included the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (N20/B48) and various diesel options. A common complaint about the 335i GT is its somewhat polarizing styling, while owners often praise its practicality, comfortable ride, and strong engine performance. Some find the larger size and weight less engaging to drive than the standard 3 Series sedan.
