### Summary Verdict
The 2004 BMW 760i, powered by its sophisticated 6.0L V12 engine, offers immense power but comes with potential reliability challenges, particularly in its complex engine and advanced suspension systems. Owners frequently report issues with ignition coils, oil leaks, and cooling system components, reflecting the complexity of the V12. The advanced suspension, whether Adaptive Drive or air suspension, is prone to hydraulic leaks and component failures, leading to significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, especially within the iDrive system and body control modules, are also noted. While the transmission is generally robust, leaks and solenoid issues can arise. The exterior and interior are typically less problematic, with no widespread critical failures reported. Prospective buyers should budget for higher maintenance and repair costs associated with this high-performance luxury sedan.
