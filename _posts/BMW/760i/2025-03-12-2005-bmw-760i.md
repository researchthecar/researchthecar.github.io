Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2005 BMW 760i, categorized as requested.

The 2005 BMW 760i represents the pinnacle of luxury and performance in BMW's 7 Series lineup during that era. Powered by a 6.0-liter V12 engine producing around 438 horsepower and 444 lb-ft of torque, it offers smooth acceleration and effortless cruising. This engine was specifically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options available in the 7 Series line for that year included inline 6 cylinder and V8 engines. Owners often praise the 760i's opulent interior, advanced technology for its time (iDrive system), and comfortable ride. Common complaints often revolve around the car's complexity, leading to potentially high maintenance costs, and the iDrive system being unintuitive. Its elegant styling and powerful engine are offset by the expense of upkeep.

**Engine**

**6.0L V12 (N73)**

*   **Valve Stem Seal Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blue smoke on startup, especially after the car has been sitting for a while. This indicates oil leaking past the valve stem seals and burning in the cylinders upon initial ignition.
    *   Solution: Replacement of valve stem seals. This often requires removing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+ (due to the labor-intensive nature of the job on a V12)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Various Locations)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks around the valve covers, oil pan gasket, or front timing cover. Burning oil smell can also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+, depending on the location and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks (Valley Pan)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss with no visible external leaks, overheating, and a sweet smell of coolant. The valley pan sits under the intake manifold, and leaks are not easily visible.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valley pan gasket and, often, the coolant transfer pipe seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (due to the extensive labor involved in accessing the valley pan)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery warning light, dimming headlights, difficulty starting, and eventually, complete electrical failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (ZF 6HP26)**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement of gears, harsh shifts between gears, or slipping under acceleration. Often accompanied by transmission fault codes.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include low fluid level, contaminated fluid, or internal damage to the transmission. Solutions can range from fluid flush and filter replacement to valve body repair/replacement or full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $5,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, transmission going into limp mode (stuck in a single gear), and numerous transmission fault codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Mechatronic unit (the transmission's electronic control unit).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (including programming)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car sitting lower on one or more corners, a suspension malfunction warning light, and the air compressor running constantly or not at all.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine which component is failing (air strut, air compressor, valve block, or air lines). Replacement of the faulty component(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ per strut, $500 - $1500 for compressor replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Poor handling and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
