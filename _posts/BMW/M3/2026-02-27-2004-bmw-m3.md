### Summary Verdict
The 2004 BMW M3 is a highly desirable performance car, but its advanced engineering and high-strung nature mean certain components require diligent maintenance and can be costly to repair. The S54 engine's rod bearings are a known potential failure point, necessitating careful monitoring and potentially proactive replacement. The SMG transmission, while offering a unique driving experience, can also present expensive hydraulic or actuator issues. Subframe cracking is another significant concern that requires attention. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and the instrument cluster, are not uncommon. Despite these potential pitfalls, with proper care and addressing these known issues, the 2004 M3 remains a rewarding and capable sports coupe.
