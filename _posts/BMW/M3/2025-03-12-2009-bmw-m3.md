The 2009 BMW M3, part of the E90/E92/E93 generation, is a performance-oriented sports car that is highly regarded for its naturally aspirated V8 engine, balanced handling, and driver-focused experience. Available in sedan (E90), coupe (E92), and convertible (E93) body styles, the M3 came standard with a 4.0-liter S65 V8 engine producing 414 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed M-DCT dual-clutch transmission. While praised for its exhilarating performance, some common criticisms include relatively high running costs, potential for expensive repairs, and a somewhat firm ride. Now, on to the issues.

**Engine**

**S65 4.0L V8**

*   **Rod Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Increased engine noise (knocking or rattling), especially when cold. Oil analysis may reveal elevated levels of bearing material. Left unaddressed, can lead to catastrophic engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the rod bearings with updated versions (often with improved clearances) and rod bolts. Consider replacing the oil pump at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+ depending on the shop and scope of work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Throttle Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine malfunction light, limp mode, rough running, hesitation. Diagnostic codes often indicate issues with the throttle actuators.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty throttle actuator(s). It's generally recommended to replace both at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+ (parts and labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* No Issues Found

**7-Speed M-DCT (Dual Clutch Transmission)**

*   **DCT Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky shifting, failure to engage gears, transmission malfunction warnings, limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the Mechatronic unit. Some shops offer software flashing/adaptation procedures as an initial troubleshooting step, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **DCT Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, jerky engagement, difficulty engaging reverse. The DCT system adapts to clutch wear, but eventually, the clutches will need replacement.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch packs. This involves removing the transmission and disassembling it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Electronic Damper Control (EDC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Stiff or uneven ride quality, EDC malfunction warnings, diagnostic codes related to individual dampers.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty EDC damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per damper (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Subframe Mount Bushing Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the rear suspension, especially over bumps or during hard acceleration/braking. Worn or cracked subframe mount bushings can affect handling and stability.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear subframe mount bushings. Upgraded aftermarket bushings are often used.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive Controller Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the iDrive controller knob, making it difficult to navigate the system.

    *   Recalls: None Found

* **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: TPMS light comes on, even when tire pressure is correct. Sensor might not transmit data, or give false data.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Folding Mirror Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Mirrors fail to fold in or out, make grinding noises, or only move partially.
    *   Solution: Replace the mirror motor or the entire mirror assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2009 BMW M3, while a highly desirable performance car, is prone to some relatively significant issues. The most concerning are the rod bearing issue on the S65 V8 and potential failures related to the M-DCT transmission. These repairs can be expensive, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection and diligent maintenance crucial. Suspension and electrical problems are also common, contributing to the overall cost of ownership. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their budget.
