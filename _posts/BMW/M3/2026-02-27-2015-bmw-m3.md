The twin-turbocharged inline-six engine, while powerful, can experience issues with wastegate actuators and oil leaks. The M-DCT transmission, a complex piece of engineering, is more prone to issues with its mechatronics unit and clutch wear compared to the manual. Electrical gremlins, particularly battery drain and infotainment glitches, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely reliable. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the M3's performance and longevity.
