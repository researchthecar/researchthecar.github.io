The 2017 BMW M3 (F80) is a high-performance sedan that's praised for its sharp handling, powerful engine, and engaging driving experience. It's powered by a 3.0-liter TwinPower Turbo inline-six engine producing 425 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. The M3 Competition Package, available as an option, bumps the horsepower to 444. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic (DCT). Many owners appreciate the M3's raw performance and track capabilities, while some criticisms include a stiff ride, especially with the adaptive suspension, and a less refined engine sound compared to previous generations.

**Engine**

**S55 3.0L TwinPower Turbo Inline-Six**

*   **Charge Air Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the charge air coolers due to cracking or corrosion. Can lead to decreased performance, engine overheating, and coolant loss. This is a fairly common issue on tuned cars.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty charge air coolers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on aftermarket vs. OEM parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crank Hub Failure (Especially on Tuned Engines)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S55 engine's crank hub, which connects the crankshaft to the timing chain, can be prone to slipping, particularly when the engine is heavily modified or tuned for increased power. This can lead to timing issues and potentially catastrophic engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the original crank hub with a pinned or aftermarket reinforced crank hub.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket and Oil Filter Housing)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve cover gasket or the oil filter housing. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket or the oil filter housing gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve Cover Gasket: $500 - $1000. Oil Filter Housing Gasket: $400-$800.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   No Issues Found

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **DCT Shifting Issues/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occasional hesitation or jerky shifts, especially at lower speeds or during parking maneuvers. Can sometimes be improved by resetting the transmission adaptation values.
    *   Solution: Perform a DCT adaptation reset/relearn procedure. If the problem persists, consider a DCT service (fluid and filter change). In severe cases, valve body replacement or full transmission rebuild may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Adaptation Reset: $100 - $200 (at a shop). DCT Service: $500 - $1,000. Valve Body: $2,000 - $4,000+. Full rebuild: $6,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the electronic dampers, leading to uneven damping, error messages on the dash, and a noticeably degraded ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty electronic dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (per damper, including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or random reboots of the iDrive infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software update, replacement of the iDrive controller.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $100-$300 (at a shop). iDrive controller replacement: $500-$1,500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the car is not driven frequently. Can be caused by parasitic draws from various electronic components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. Replace the battery if it is old or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis: $100 - $300. Battery replacement: $300-$600. Repairing parasitic draw: Varies greatly depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Carbon Fiber Roof Delamination (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clear coat on the carbon fiber roof can start to peel or delaminate, creating a cloudy or uneven appearance.
    *   Solution: Refinishing the roof, or replacing the roof panel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Refinishing: $1,000 - $2,500. Replacement: $4,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2017 BMW M3 is a performance-oriented vehicle that comes with some specific issues to be aware of. The most significant potential problem revolves around the S55 engine, specifically the crank hub, especially in tuned vehicles, as well as charge air cooler failures. Transmission issues, particularly with the DCT, can also arise. Electrical gremlins with the iDrive system and battery drain are also notable. While most of the issues are not catastrophic if addressed early, they can be expensive to repair, especially the engine-related problems. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the car's service history, particularly regarding the crank hub and cooling system. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW mechanic is highly recommended.
