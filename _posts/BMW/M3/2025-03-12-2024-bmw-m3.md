The 2024 BMW M3 is a high-performance sports sedan that continues the legacy of the M3 lineage. It's powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six engine, producing 473 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque in its base configuration, and 503 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque in the Competition trim. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (base model) and an 8-speed M Steptronic automatic transmission (standard on Competition). People love the M3 for its exhilarating performance, precise handling, and driver-focused experience. However, some common complaints include its controversial styling (particularly the large kidney grilles), firm ride quality (especially on non-adaptive suspensions), and the high price tag.
