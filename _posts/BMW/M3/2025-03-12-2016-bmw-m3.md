The 2016 BMW M3 (F80) is a high-performance sedan known for its sharp handling, powerful engine, and aggressive styling. It is powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six engine (S55) that produces 425 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. An optional Competition Package increases power output to 444 horsepower. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic (DCT). Owners often praise the M3 for its thrilling driving experience, precise steering, and potent engine. However, some common complaints revolve around the harsh ride quality, especially with the optional adaptive suspension, and the engine's somewhat artificial sound enhancement.

**Engine**

**S55 3.0L Twin-Turbo Inline-Six**

*   **Crank Hub Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S55 engine is known for potential crank hub failure, where the friction fit between the crankshaft and the hub that drives the timing chain can slip. This can cause the timing to go out of alignment, leading to misfires, rough running, and potentially catastrophic engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms can include a check engine light, reduced power, and unusual engine noises.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to replace the stock crank hub with a pinned or keyed crank hub. This involves removing the front of the engine and installing the upgraded hub.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charge Air Cooler Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The charge air coolers, responsible for cooling the intake air, can develop leaks. Symptoms include reduced power, poor throttle response, and potentially a check engine light. Visible coolant loss may also be observed.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking charge air coolers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000 (depending on cooler cost and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic (DCT)**

*   **DCT Shifting Problems/Harshness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the DCT transmission, including harsh shifting, jerky engagement, and occasional difficulty engaging gears, especially at low speeds.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue, but in some cases, clutch replacement or valve body repair is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (software update) - $3,000+ (clutch replacement/valve body repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electronically controlled adaptive dampers can fail, leading to a noticeable degradation in ride quality and handling. Symptoms include uneven ride height, excessive bouncing, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty adaptive dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on the number of dampers replaced and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Idrive Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can sometimes experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Software update or replacement of the iDrive unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Software Update) - $1,500+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Carbon Fiber Roof Delamination (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: On models equipped with the carbon fiber roof, some owners have reported delamination or separation of the carbon fiber layers, resulting in a cloudy or peeling appearance.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the carbon fiber roof.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattles and Squeaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have complained about rattles and squeaks developing in the interior, particularly from the dashboard, door panels, and rear shelf.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the rattles, which may involve tightening loose trim pieces, adding padding, or replacing worn clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW M3 offers a thrilling driving experience, but it's essential to be aware of potential issues. The most significant concern is the crank hub failure, which can be costly to fix. Other potential problems include DCT transmission issues, adaptive damper failures, and electrical glitches. While interior rattles and exterior carbon fiber delamination are also reported, they are generally less severe. The overall cost of ownership can be higher than some competitors due to the potential for these repairs. Buyers should carefully inspect the car's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW mechanic.
