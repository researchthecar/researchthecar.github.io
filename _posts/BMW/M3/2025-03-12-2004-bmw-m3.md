The 2004 BMW M3 is a highly sought-after sports coupe known for its exhilarating driving experience. It's powered by a 3.2-liter S54 inline-six engine, producing 333 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. All models came with a rear-wheel-drive configuration. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox). The M3 is praised for its sharp handling, responsive engine, and iconic styling. Downsides often cited include the cost of maintenance and the potential for expensive repairs as the cars age.

**Engine**

**S54 3.2L Inline-Six**

*   **VANOS System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VANOS (Variable Nockenwellen Steuerung, BMW's variable valve timing system) can suffer from failures of the solenoid pack, oil pump, or hub assembly. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the front of the engine, loss of power (especially in lower RPMs), rough idle, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty VANOS components. This can involve rebuilding the VANOS unit, replacing the solenoid pack, or addressing oil supply issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rod Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S54 engine is known for rod bearing issues. Insufficient bearing clearance leads to premature wear and eventual failure. Symptoms include a knocking noise from the lower end of the engine, especially when cold, and metallic particles in the oil. Catastrophic failure can result in significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the rod bearings with updated bearings that have increased clearances. This is often done preventatively as a precaution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Adjustment**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S54 engine requires periodic valve adjustments. If neglected, this can lead to decreased performance, increased engine noise, and potential valve damage.
    *   Solution: Perform a valve adjustment according to the manufacturer's specifications.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6-Speed SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox)**

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMG transmission uses a hydraulic pump to control gear changes. The pump can fail, leading to slow or non-existent gear changes, error messages on the dashboard, and the inability to start the car.
    *   Solution: Replace the SMG hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SMG Relay Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMG system has an accumulator relay that, when it fails, can drain the battery when the car is off. This relay is located behind the glove box.
    *   Solution: Replace the SMG relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gear Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty gear position sensors can cause inaccurate gear display, difficulty shifting, or complete inability to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty gear position sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Subframe Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A well-known issue with the E46 M3 is cracking of the rear subframe mounting points on the chassis. This can manifest as clunking noises from the rear suspension, especially over bumps, and visible cracks in the sheet metal around the subframe mounting points.
    *   Solution: Repair or reinforcement of the rear subframe mounting points. Options include welding in reinforcement plates or replacing the entire rear floor pan.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The control arm bushings, particularly the front lower control arm bushings (FCAB), wear out over time, leading to vague steering, wandering on the road, and clunking noises from the front suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings. Upgraded polyurethane bushings are a common replacement option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Pixel Loss in Instrument Cluster**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LCD display in the instrument cluster can suffer from pixel loss, making it difficult to read important information like mileage and temperature.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster. Repair services are available to replace the LCD screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The window regulators are prone to failure, causing the windows to become stuck or operate erratically.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500
