### Summary Verdict
The 2016 BMW M3 (F80) is a highly capable performance sedan. While its S55 engine and M-DCT transmission offer thrilling performance, they are also the most common sources of significant repair costs, particularly rod bearing wear and mechatronics unit issues. Owners should prioritize diligent maintenance, especially oil changes, and be aware of potential cooling system and turbocharger concerns. Electrical gremlins and suspension component failures are less common but can still arise. The manual transmission variant appears to be more robust. Overall, while not immune to issues, the M3's reliability is generally in line with a high-performance vehicle, with most problems being addressable with proper diagnosis and repair.
