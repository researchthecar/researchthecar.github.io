The 2001 BMW M3 is a legendary sports coupe known for its sharp handling, responsive engine, and iconic styling. It was only available with one engine option, the S54 3.2-liter inline-six engine producing 333 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. The M3 offered two transmission options: a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox). Owners generally love the car's engaging driving experience, powerful engine, and timeless design. Common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs, the SMG transmission's reliability, and the age-related issues that affect many 20+ year old vehicles.
