The 2022 BMW M3 is a high-performance sports sedan offering a thrilling driving experience. It comes standard with a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six engine producing 473 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque in its base configuration. The M3 Competition boosts output to 503 hp and 479 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual transmission is available on the base M3, while the Competition models exclusively use an eight-speed automatic transmission.
