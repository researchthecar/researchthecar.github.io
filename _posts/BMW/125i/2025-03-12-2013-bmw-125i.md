The 2013 BMW 125i is a rear-wheel-drive hatchback known for its sporty handling and enjoyable driving experience. While not officially sold in the US market, it was a popular model in Europe and other regions. Available engine options included a range of turbocharged petrol and diesel engines. The 125i specifically features a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine producing around 218 horsepower and 310 Nm of torque. Other engine options for the 1 Series included various smaller petrol and diesel engines. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. People generally appreciate the 125i for its engaging driving dynamics, responsive engine, and relatively compact size. Some common complaints include the somewhat firm ride, especially on sport-tuned suspensions, and potentially higher maintenance costs associated with BMW ownership.
