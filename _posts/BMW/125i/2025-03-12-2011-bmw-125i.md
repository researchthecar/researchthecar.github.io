The 2011 BMW 125i is a sporty coupe and convertible known for its responsive handling and engaging driving experience. It's part of the E82/E88 generation of the 1 Series. The 125i features a 3.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-6 engine (N52B30) producing around 218 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 1 Series in other markets include the 116i, 118i, 120i and the 135i with a turbo 6-cylinder. Available transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the car's compact size, sharp steering, and the smooth power delivery of the inline-6. However, some common dislikes include the cramped rear seats (especially in the coupe), and higher maintenance costs associated with BMW ownership.
