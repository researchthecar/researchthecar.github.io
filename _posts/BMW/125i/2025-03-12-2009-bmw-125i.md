**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (N52B25)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations on the engine, including the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gasket is the common solution. Thorough cleaning of the affected area is also recommended before installing a new gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VANOS (Variable Nockenwellen Spreizung) system controls the variable valve timing. Malfunctioning VANOS solenoids can cause rough idling, reduced power, and engine hesitation. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to VANOS are often present.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the faulty VANOS solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per solenoid, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cooling system components, such as the water pump, thermostat, and coolant hoses, can fail. Overheating, coolant leaks, and "check engine" lights are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty component(s). Regular coolant flushes are also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $700+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (GA6HP19Z)**

*   **Mechatronic Sleeve Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit, which is the transmission control unit, connects to the transmission valve body through a rubber sleeve. The rubber sleeve can degrade over time and start to leak, causing transmission slipping or failure.
    * Solution: Replacing the Mechatronic Sleeve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body contains intricate solenoids and valves that control the flow of transmission fluid. Wear or contamination within the valve body can lead to harsh shifting, delayed engagement, or transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body. Flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter are also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Cracked or Broken Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Especially on vehicles driven on rough roads, coil springs can crack or break. This can cause uneven ride height, unusual noises (clunking or rattling), and compromised handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken spring(s) â€“ often recommended to replace in pairs (both front or both rear) for balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per pair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The control arm bushings connect the control arms to the vehicle's frame. These bushings can wear out over time, leading to clunking noises, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or, in some cases, the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Comfort Access System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Comfort Access system, which allows keyless entry and start, can experience glitches. Symptoms include the system not recognizing the key fob, difficulty starting the car, or erratic locking/unlocking behavior.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause (faulty door handle sensor, antenna amplifier, or control module) and replacing the defective component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can lead to a dead battery, especially after the car has been sitting for a while. Potential causes include a faulty alternator, a parasitic draw from an electrical component that is not turning off properly, or an aging battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the battery drain (replacing the alternator, fixing the faulty component, or replacing the battery).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Wheel Arches/Door Edges**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the wheel arches, door edges, and other areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Repairing the rust damage by sanding, applying rust inhibitors, and repainting the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticking Sunroof**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can become sticky or jammed, making it difficult to open or close smoothly. This is often due to dried-out lubrication or debris accumulation in the tracks.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks and mechanism. In severe cases, the sunroof motor or entire assembly may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2009 BMW 125i is a fun-to-drive car, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine oil leaks, VANOS issues, and cooling system problems are typical concerns.
