The 2008 BMW 125i is a compact sports coupe/convertible known for its engaging driving dynamics and classic BMW styling. In addition to the 2.5L inline-6 (N52B25) engine, the 125i was also offered with a 3.0L inline-6 (N52B30) engine in some markets. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5L engine produces around 218 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Many owners appreciate the car's responsive handling, comfortable front seats, and relatively compact size, making it fun to drive in urban environments. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space (especially in the coupe), and potential for expensive repairs common to BMWs.
