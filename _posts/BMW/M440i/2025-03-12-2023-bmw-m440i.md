The 2023 BMW M440i is a performance-oriented coupe, convertible, and Gran Coupe (four-door coupe) known for its blend of luxury, sporty handling, and potent powertrain. The most common engine option is the B58 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six, producing 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Some owners praise the M440i for its smooth power delivery, comfortable ride (especially with adaptive dampers), and stylish design. Common criticisms include the iDrive infotainment system's learning curve, the polarizing front grille design, and the relatively high price point. Other engine and transmission options that are available are the 2.0L Inline 4 cylinder B48 engine and the 8-speed sport automatic transmission.
