The 2015 BMW Alpina B7 xDrive is a high-performance luxury sedan known for its blend of comfort, exclusivity, and impressive power. Powered by a modified version of BMW's 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, it produces approximately 540 horsepower and 540 lb-ft of torque. All models use an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the car's smooth ride, powerful acceleration, and luxurious interior. Some criticisms include higher running costs compared to standard BMW 7-Series models, and potential maintenance challenges associated with the bespoke Alpina components.

**Engine**

**4.4L Twin-Turbocharged V8 (N63TU)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various seals and gaskets, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals. Proper torque during reassembly is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can originate from hoses, the expansion tank, or the water pump. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles. The "valley pan" under the intake manifold is a common leak point that is difficult to access.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking hoses, the expansion tank, water pump, or valley pan gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turbocharger failure can manifest as reduced power, whistling noises, and potentially smoke from the exhaust. Issues can include wastegate actuator failure or internal turbocharger damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty turbocharger or repair the wastegate actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+ (per turbo)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 8HP70 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body, which controls the flow of transmission fluid, can experience wear or malfunction. This can lead to rough shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve body or rebuild the existing one. Some owners have found success with aftermarket valve body upgrades.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Sleeve Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic sleeve, which seals the electrical connector to the transmission, can leak transmission fluid. This can cause shifting problems and eventually damage the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the mechatronic sleeve and transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor can fail, leading to a sagging or uneven ride height, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor. Also inspect for leaks in the air struts or lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air struts themselves can develop leaks, causing the air suspension to lose pressure.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+ (per strut)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Software updates, or replacement of the iDrive module may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur, often due to a faulty module or parasitic draw. This can result in a dead battery, especially after the car sits for a period of time.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the battery drain. This may involve replacing a faulty module or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Adaptive Headlight Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Adaptive headlights may fail to adjust properly, or display error messages.
