The 2003 BMW 325xi is an all-wheel-drive variant of the popular E46 3-Series. Its equipped with a 2.5L inline-6 engine that produces 184 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the E46 included a 3.0L inline-6 (330i/xi), and a 2.0L inline-4 (318i/xi, not generally available in the US market). Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 325xi for its balanced handling, solid build quality, and the smooth power delivery of the inline-6 engine. Downsides often mentioned are the relatively high maintenance costs and the propensity for certain components to fail as the car ages.

**Summary**

The 2003 BMW 325xi, while a desirable car for its driving dynamics and overall quality, is prone to a number of age-related issues. Engine oil leaks and cooling system problems are common, and suspension components wear out requiring replacement. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the windows and instrument cluster, are also frequent occurrences. Transmission issues can be costly to address if not caught early. While the severity of these issues varies, owners should be prepared for ongoing maintenance and repair costs. Preventative maintenance and addressing problems promptly can help mitigate more extensive and expensive repairs down the line. The cost of ownership will be higher compared to more modern or less complex vehicles.
