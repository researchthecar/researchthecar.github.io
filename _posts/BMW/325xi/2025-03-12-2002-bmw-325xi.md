The most common problems revolve around oil leaks from engine gaskets and bushings, suspension components wearing out, and electrical gremlins. Repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing gaskets or resistors to more costly procedures such as transmission work or rust repair. While the car offers a great driving experience, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs and be prepared to address them to keep the car in good running condition.
