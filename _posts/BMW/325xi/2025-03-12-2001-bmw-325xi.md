The 2001 BMW 325xi is an all-wheel-drive variant of the E46 3-Series, a popular entry-level luxury car known for its sporty handling and refined driving experience. The 325xi comes standard with a 2.5-liter inline-6 cylinder engine (M54B25) producing 184 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the E46 3-Series include the M54B30 (3.0 liter, 225 hp) and the M43B19 (1.9 liter, 116 hp) and M44B19 (1.9 Liter, 140 hp) but they are not available on the 325xi model. Transmission options available on the 325xi are a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Drivers often appreciate the 325xi for its balanced handling, solid build quality (for its time), and the smooth power delivery of the inline-6 engine. Common dislikes include the car's susceptibility to rust, electrical gremlins, and the higher maintenance costs associated with European cars.
