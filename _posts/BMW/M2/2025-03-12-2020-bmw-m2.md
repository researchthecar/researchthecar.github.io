The 2020 BMW M2 Competition is a high-performance coupe celebrated for its engaging driving dynamics and powerful engine. It's powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six engine (S55) producing 405 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic (DCT). Owners praise the M2's responsive handling, potent acceleration, and relatively compact size, making it a fun and capable sports car. Some common criticisms include a firm ride, especially on rough roads, and a somewhat basic interior compared to other luxury cars.
