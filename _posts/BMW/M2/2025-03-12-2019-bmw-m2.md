The 2019 BMW M2 Competition is a high-performance sports coupe celebrated for its engaging driving dynamics, powerful engine, and relatively compact size. It's generally well-regarded by enthusiasts but, like any car, has potential issues. The M2 Competition features a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-6 engine (S55) producing 405 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. All M2 Competitions have the S55 engine. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praise the M2 Competition for its responsive handling, strong acceleration, and overall fun-to-drive factor. Common dislikes revolve around a somewhat stiff ride, a relatively basic interior compared to higher-end BMW models, and potential maintenance costs associated with a high-performance vehicle.

**Engine**

**S55 3.0L Twin-Turbo Inline-6**

*   **Crank Hub Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S55 engine is known for potential crank hub failure, where the friction surfaces between the crank hub and the crankshaft can slip, causing timing misalignment. Symptoms include check engine light, rough running, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the stock crank hub with a pinned or upgraded aftermarket crank hub is the most common solution to prevent future slippage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the shop and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket, Oil Filter Housing)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from the valve cover gasket and oil filter housing gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:
Valve Cover Gasket: $500 - $1,000
Oil Filter Housing Gasket: $400-$800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the VANOS (Variable Camshaft Timing) solenoids can cause rough idling, reduced power, and check engine lights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty VANOS solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800 per solenoid depending on location and labor rate
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the car's performance-oriented nature, the clutch can experience accelerated wear, particularly with aggressive driving. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and a high clutch pedal engagement point.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement with either an OEM or aftermarket performance clutch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DCT can experience issues with the mechatronic unit (transmission control unit), leading to shifting problems, harsh engagement, and error messages.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the mechatronic unit, potentially including software updates.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair approach.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing excessive battery drain, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can result in difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery.
    * Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify the source of the drain. Potential causes include a faulty module not entering sleep mode, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery. Replacing the battery or repairing the offending module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1,000+ depending on the source of the drain
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **iDrive System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can sometimes experience glitches, such as freezing, slow response times, or connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In more severe cases, the iDrive control unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: Typically Free or $100 - $200, iDrive unit replacement: $1,000 - $2,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 BMW M2 Competition, while a highly desirable performance car, does have potential issues to be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for crank hub failure, which can be a costly repair. Oil leaks are also a common issue. Transmission issues are more prevalent in the DCT, although clutch wear is a concern for manual transmissions, especially with aggressive driving. Electrical issues can occur, however are not particularly common. Overall, while the M2 Competition is reliable, preventative maintenance, particularly addressing the crank hub, can help mitigate major problems. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the repair shop, but owners should be prepared for potentially high maintenance costs associated with a performance vehicle.
