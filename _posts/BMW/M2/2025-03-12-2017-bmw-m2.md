The 2017 BMW M2 is a performance-oriented coupe lauded for its engaging driving dynamics, potent engine, and relatively compact size. It's often praised for its responsiveness, sharp handling, and overall fun factor. Conversely, some criticisms include a stiff ride, especially on rough roads, and a somewhat basic interior for the price point. The 2017 M2 is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (N55) producing 365 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic.

**Summary**

The 2017 BMW M2, while an excellent performance car, has some potential issues to be aware of. Engine issues like oil leaks and VANOS problems are relatively common and can lead to moderate repair costs. The DCT transmission, if equipped, is a potential high-cost area for concern due to possible mechatronics unit failures. Suspension and electrical issues are also possible, adding to the overall ownership costs. While these issues may not affect every M2, potential buyers should be aware of them and carefully inspect any used vehicle before purchase or order a Pre-Purchase Inspection (PPI) from a trusted mechanic.
