**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (N20/N26)**

*   **Oil Leaks from Valve Cover Gasket:**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve cover gasket, leading to a burning smell and potential oil loss. Visible oil around the valve cover and down the side of the engine block.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket. In some cases, the entire valve cover needs to be replaced if it is warped or cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+

*   **Timing Chain Issues:**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. Potential for complete timing chain failure, which can cause significant engine damage. This issue is more prevalent in earlier N20 engines, but still possible in the 2016 model year.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks:**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant warning light, visible coolant leaks under the vehicle, overheating. Common leak points include the coolant expansion tank, hoses, and water pump.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the source of the leak)

    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be needed to check for valve body issues or mechatronic unit failure. In extreme cases, a full transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (fluid/filter), $1,500 - $4,000+ (valve body/mechatronic unit), $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
