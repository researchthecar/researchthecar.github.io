Paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and xDrive all-wheel drive, it offers an impressive balance of speed, handling, and all-weather capability. The 550i xDrive is known for its spacious interior, advanced technology, and sleek exterior, but like any vehicle, it has its share of issues reported by owners.

**Engine**

**4.4L Twin-Turbocharged V8**

* **Fuel Pump Failure:** Can fail prematurely, causing loss of power and potential engine damage. Symptoms include difficulty starting, stalling, or engine misfires. Solution involves replacing the fuel pump and filter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
* **Valvetronic System Issues:** The Valvetronic system, which controls valve lift and timing, can experience issues leading to reduced engine performance, increased emissions, and excessive fuel consumption. Symptoms may include engine knocking, sluggish acceleration, and check engine light illumination. Solution involves diagnosing and repairing or replacing faulty components within the Valvetronic system. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
* **Turbocharger Wastegate Actuator Failure:** The wastegate actuator, which controls turbocharger boost pressure, can fail causing overboosting or underboosting. Symptoms include decreased engine power, increased exhaust smoke, and check engine light. Solution involves replacing the turbocharger wastegate actuator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** The mechatronic unit, which controls transmission functions, can malfunction leading to transmission slipping, gear engagement issues, and check engine light illumination. Solution involves replacing the mechatronic unit. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $3,500+
* **Torque Converter Issues:** The torque converter, which connects the engine to the transmission, can experience shuddering or slipping. Symptoms may include vibrations during acceleration or deceleration. Solution involves replacing the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

**Suspension**

* **Front Control Arm Bushings Wear:** The front control arm bushings, which connect the control arms to the chassis, can wear out prematurely leading to excessive noise, vibration, and impaired handling. Solution involves replacing the worn bushings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per side

**Electrical**

* **Battery Discharge Problems:** The 550i xDrive can experience battery discharge issues, especially when the vehicle is not driven regularly. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle, electronic malfunctions, and a dead battery. Solution involves diagnosing the electrical system and repairing or replacing the battery if necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **iDrive System Glitches:** The iDrive infotainment system can experience software glitches, freezing, or connectivity issues. Symptoms may include unresponsive touch controls, system crashes, and navigation problems. Solution involves updating the iDrive software or replacing faulty components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Drain Clogs:** The sunroof drains can become clogged with debris, leading to water leakage inside the vehicle. Symptoms include water stains on the headliner, carpets, or dashboard. Solution involves cleaning the sunroof drains and ensuring they remain clear. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Interior**

* **Center Console Trim Rattling:** The center console trim pieces can become loose and rattle when the vehicle is driven on rough roads. Solution involves tightening the trim pieces or replacing clips that may have broken. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Climate Control Malfunctions:** The climate control system can experience issues such as temperature irregularities, fan problems, or air conditioning compressor failures. Symptoms may include poor temperature control, reduced airflow, or a non-functioning air conditioning system. Solution involves diagnosing and repairing the faulty climate control components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Summary**

The 2015 BMW 550i xDrive is a powerful and luxurious sedan, but it is not without its issues. While the engine and transmission are generally reliable, there have been reported cases of fuel pump failure, Valvetronic system problems, and turbocharger wastegate actuator failure. Transmission issues include mechatronic unit malfunctions and torque converter problems. The suspension can suffer from premature wear of the front control arm bushings. Electrical issues such as battery discharge problems and iDrive system glitches have also been reported. Exterior concerns include clogged sunroof drains, while interior issues include center console trim rattling and climate control malfunctions.

Overall, the severity of the issues can vary depending on the specific problem and its frequency. The cost of repairs can be significant, particularly for major components such as the transmission and engine. However, it's important to note that these issues do not affect all 550i xDrive vehicles, and many owners report a positive experience with the car.
