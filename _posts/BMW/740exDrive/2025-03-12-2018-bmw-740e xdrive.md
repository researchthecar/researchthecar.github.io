Here is a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2018 BMW 740e xDrive, formatted for your website.

The 2018 BMW 740e xDrive is a plug-in hybrid variant of the 7 Series luxury sedan. It combines a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor, delivering a combined output of 322 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. All models are equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission. This vehicle is generally praised for its luxurious interior, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency (when utilizing the electric motor). Some common complaints include the complexity of the hybrid system, potential maintenance costs associated with both the combustion engine and electric components, and a smaller trunk space due to the battery pack.

**Electric Motor**

*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the capacity of the high-voltage battery pack can decrease, leading to reduced electric-only range and overall hybrid system efficiency. Owners may notice that the vehicle doesn't travel as far on a full charge as it did when new.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+ depending on the source (dealership vs. independent shop) and battery condition/availability.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Electric Motor Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electric motor may experience a failure, causing the vehicle to lose electric drive functionality. Warning lights on the dashboard related to the hybrid system will illuminate. This can be due to various component failures within the motor or its control systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the failing component. The component may be replaced or the entire motor may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $7,000+ depending on the specific part and the labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from various engine components, such as the water pump, thermostat housing, or radiator hoses. This can lead to overheating and potential engine damage. The smell of coolant or visible puddles under the vehicle are common signs.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the source of the leak. Replacement of the leaking component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+, depending on the component and location.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from valve cover gasket. Oil may drip onto the exhaust manifold, creating a burning smell.
    * Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during gear changes, harsh or jerky shifting, and occasional slipping between gears.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush can sometimes resolve minor shifting issues. In other cases, valve body issues may require repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush: $300 - $500. Valve body repair/replacement: $1,500 - $4,000+. Complete transmission replacement: $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit controls the shifting and overall operation of the 8-speed automatic transmission. When it fails, it can cause erratic shifting, the transmission to go into "limp" mode, or complete loss of transmission functionality.
    * Solution: Replacement of the mechatronic unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system provides a comfortable ride. However, the air compressor can fail, leading to a saggy or uneven ride height, particularly overnight. A warning light on the dashboard may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks in the air struts can cause the air suspension to lose pressure, leading to ride height issues and a bumpy ride. You may hear hissing sounds coming from the struts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+ per strut.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**
