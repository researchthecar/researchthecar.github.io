The 2017 BMW 740e xDrive is a plug-in hybrid luxury sedan that blends performance and fuel efficiency. Its powertrain consists of a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 322 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The 740e is equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 740e was discontinued after 2019. Owners often praise the car's smooth ride, luxurious interior, and advanced technology features.
