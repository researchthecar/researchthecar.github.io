### Summary Verdict
The 2007 BMW Z4, particularly with its inline-six engines, is generally a reliable sports car, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine oil leaks from the valve cover and oil pan gaskets are relatively frequent and manageable. Cooling system components like the water pump and thermostat can also require attention. For transmissions, manual clutches will eventually need replacement, and automatics may develop leaks or solenoid issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are known to wear. Electrical gremlins can include window regulators and Xenon headlight components. The convertible top mechanism, while a highlight, can be a source of costly repairs if hydraulic systems fail. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing these specific potential issues, the Z4 can remain a rewarding vehicle.
