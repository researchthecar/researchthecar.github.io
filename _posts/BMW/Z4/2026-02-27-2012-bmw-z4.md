The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the more complex systems, such as the dual-clutch transmission (DCT) and the retractable hardtop mechanism, which can be costly to repair if issues arise. Owners of the higher-performance turbocharged engines should be aware of potential turbocharger and fuel injector problems. Electrical glitches, particularly with the iDrive system, are also noted but often resolvable with software updates. Overall, with diligent maintenance and attention to these specific components, the Z4 can remain a reliable and enjoyable sports car.
