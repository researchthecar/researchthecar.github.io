### Summary Verdict
The 2004 BMW Z4, particularly with its inline-six engines, is a desirable sports car. While generally robust, common issues revolve around the VANOS system, oil leaks from gaskets, and wear on clutch components for manual transmissions. Automatic transmissions can develop leaks or torque converter problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and rear shocks are also known to wear. Electrical gremlins can include window regulators and Xenon headlight components. The convertible top mechanism is a notable area for potential hydraulic issues. Despite these potential repairs, many Z4s remain reliable with proper maintenance, offering an engaging driving experience.
