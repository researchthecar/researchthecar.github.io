### Summary Verdict
The 2003 BMW Z4, while offering an engaging driving experience, exhibits some common issues typical for its age and German engineering. The inline-six engines are generally robust but can suffer from VANOS system problems and oil leaks, primarily from gaskets. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, can experience clutch wear or issues with the automatic transmission's torque converter and fluid leaks. Suspension components like control arm bushings and rear shocks are also known wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly window regulators and Xenon headlight components, can arise. The convertible top mechanism is a significant potential expense if it fails. Overall, the Z4 requires diligent maintenance and can incur moderate to significant repair costs for common failures, especially those related to the convertible top and powertrain.
