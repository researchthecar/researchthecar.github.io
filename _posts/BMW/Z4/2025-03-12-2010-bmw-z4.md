The 2010 BMW Z4 (E89) is a two-seat roadster or coupe known for its sporty handling and stylish design. Engine options include the sDrive30i powered by a naturally aspirated 3.0L inline-6 producing 255 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, the sDrive35i which uses a twin-turbocharged 3.0L inline-6 making 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, and the top-of-the-line sDrive35is boasting a tuned version of the same twin-turbo 3.0L producing 335 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. The sDrive30i was generally equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the sDrive35i offered either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). The sDrive35is came exclusively with the 7-speed DCT. Owners often praise the Z4's responsive steering, powerful engine options (especially the turbocharged variants), and the retractable hardtop, which offers the security and quietness of a coupe. Common complaints include limited storage space, a firm ride (especially on models with sport suspension), and potential for higher maintenance costs associated with BMWs in general.

**Summary**

The 2010 BMW Z4 presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from relatively minor annoyances to more serious mechanical and electrical problems. Engine issues like oil leaks and HPFP failure (particularly on the turbocharged models) can be costly. Transmission problems, especially with the DCT, can also result in expensive repairs. Electrical gremlins can be difficult to diagnose. While many owners enjoy the Z4's performance and style, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for higher maintenance costs and factor this into their purchasing decision.
