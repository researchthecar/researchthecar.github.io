Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2019 BMW Z4, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options, following your requested format.

The 2019 BMW Z4 marked the return of the roadster after a brief hiatus. It was offered with two primary engine options: the sDrive30i featuring a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and the M40i equipped with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine delivering 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were exclusively paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Z4 for its sharp handling, stylish design, and comfortable interior. Common criticisms often revolve around the lack of a manual transmission option and the relatively firm ride, particularly on models with larger wheels and the adaptive suspension.
