The 2016 BMW Z4 is a two-seat roadster known for its sporty handling and stylish design. Engine options for the 2016 Z4 include the sDrive28i with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, the sDrive35i with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, and the sDrive35is with a more powerful version of the same 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 producing 335 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. All engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (sDrive35i and sDrive35is), while the sDrive28i used an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Z4's sharp handling, responsive engines, and attractive styling. Common complaints often revolve around the relatively firm ride (especially with the sport suspension), limited storage space, and some reported reliability concerns.
