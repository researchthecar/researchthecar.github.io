The 2013 BMW Z4 is a stylish and fun-to-drive roadster, offered with three engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (sDrive28i), a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (sDrive35i), and a more powerful version of the 3.0-liter turbo inline-6 (sDrive35is). The sDrive28i produces 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both the sDrive35i and sDrive35is come with a 7-speed dual clutch transmission as an option. The sDrive35i makes 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque, while the sDrive35is boasts 335 hp and 332 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Z4 for its attractive styling, engaging driving dynamics, and comfortable interior. However, some common complaints include a somewhat stiff ride, limited cargo space, and potential for relatively high maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (sDrive28i)**
* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often originating from the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, or the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal is usually the required fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location and complexity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6 (sDrive35i & sDrive35is)**

* **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) can fail, causing long crank times, rough idling, and/or complete stalling. This issue is more prevalent in the earlier N54 variants of this engine, but can also occur in the N55 used in the 2013 models.
    * Solution: Replacing the HPFP is the standard solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Filter Housing Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: The oil filter housing gasket can dry out and leak, leading to oil drips and potential overheating if the oil level drops too low.
    * Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual Clutch (DCT) (sDrive35i & sDrive35is)**

* **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit, which controls the DCT, can fail. Symptoms include rough or delayed shifting, transmission slipping, or the transmission going into limp mode.
    * Solution: Replacement or rebuilding of the Mechatronic unit. In some cases, reprogramming the unit can resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Cracked Springs**
    * Description/Symptoms: Springs can crack, leading to uneven ride height, unusual noises (clunking or popping) from the suspension, and diminished handling.
    * Solution: Replacing the cracked spring(s). It's generally recommended to replace springs in pairs (both front or both rear).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per pair, including labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur, particularly if the car sits unused for extended periods. This can be due to a faulty module not going to sleep, or other electrical issues.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the source of the drain (often requiring a specialized BMW scan tool) and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Convertible Top Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The convertible top mechanism can sometimes experience issues, such as slow or incomplete operation, unusual noises, or failure to open or close completely. This can stem from faulty sensors, motor issues, or hydraulic leaks.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the faulty components (sensors, motor, hydraulic pump, etc.).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the specific problem.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sticking Seat Adjuster Controls**
    * Description/Symptoms: The electric seat adjustment controls may become sticky or unresponsive.
    * Solution: Cleaning or lubricating the controls, or replacing the faulty switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 BMW Z4 can be a rewarding car to own but requires careful attention to potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine, specifically the High Pressure Fuel Pump and Oil Leaks, and the transmission, primarily Mechatronic unit failures in the DCT. Suspension and electrical problems also surface with some frequency. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, particularly those related to the DCT and HPFP, can be quite costly. Pre-purchase inspections and regular maintenance are crucial to mitigating these risks.
