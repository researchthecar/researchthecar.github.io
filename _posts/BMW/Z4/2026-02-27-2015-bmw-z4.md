### Summary Verdict
The 2015 BMW Z4 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its robust inline-6 engines and the widely praised 8-speed automatic transmission. The primary areas to monitor are potential issues with the turbocharger system on all engine variants, the electric water pump (especially on the 3.0L engines), and the mechatronics unit in the DCT transmission. The retractable hardtop mechanism can also require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system, are not uncommon but often resolvable with software updates. For the most part, the Z4 offers a dependable and enjoyable ownership experience, with most reported issues being specific to certain components rather than systemic failures.
