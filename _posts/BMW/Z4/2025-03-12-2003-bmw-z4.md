The 2003 BMW Z4 marked a significant shift in BMW's roadster design, replacing the Z3 with a more modern and angular aesthetic. The initial engine options for the 2003 Z4 included the 2.5L inline-6 (M54B25) producing 184 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque and the 3.0L inline-6 (M54B30) producing 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were initially offered with a 5-speed manual, 5-speed automatic, or 6-speed manual transmission options. Owners generally appreciate the Z4's sharp handling, sporty driving experience, and classic roadster styling. Common complaints often revolve around the relatively harsh ride, especially with the sport suspension, and the limited interior space and storage. Early models are now reaching an age where certain maintenance items and wear-related issues are becoming more prevalent.
