The 2022 BMW Z4 is a stylish two-seat roadster that offers a blend of performance and luxury. It comes with two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (Z4 sDrive30i) producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (Z4 M40i) generating 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Z4's sharp handling, comfortable interior, and attractive design. Some common criticisms include limited storage space and a somewhat firm ride, especially on models equipped with larger wheels.
