### Summary Verdict
The 2011 BMW Z4 generally presents good reliability, especially with its naturally aspirated inline-six engines and manual transmissions. The primary areas of concern tend to be associated with the more complex twin-turbocharged engine (sDrive35i) and the dual-clutch automatic transmission, which can experience issues with turbochargers, fuel injectors, and the mechatronic unit. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the power convertible top and the iDrive system, are also noted. While the chassis, suspension, exterior, and interior are typically robust, potential buyers should be mindful of the specific powertrain chosen and budget for potential repairs on the higher-performance variants. Overall, with proper maintenance and awareness of common issues, the Z4 can be a rewarding ownership experience.
