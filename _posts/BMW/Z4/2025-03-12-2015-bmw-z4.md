The 2015 BMW Z4 is a stylish and sporty two-seat convertible roadster. The 2015 Z4 came with three engine options: the sDrive28i which is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, the sDrive35i with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, and the sDrive35is with a tuned version of the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 producing 335 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. The sDrive28i could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the sDrive35i offered a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The sDrive35is was only available with the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. Many owners praise the Z4 for its sleek design, engaging driving dynamics, and comfortable interior for a roadster. Common complaints include a relatively small trunk, limited storage space in the cabin, and potential for expensive repairs due to the car's complexity.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (sDrive28i)**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various points on the engine, including the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing, and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or component is the solution. For more severe leaks, inspecting the oil system components, such as the oil pump and lines, and replacing any damaged parts is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+ depending on the source of the leak.

**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6 (sDrive35i & sDrive35is)**

* **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The High Pressure Fuel Pump is a common issue with the N54 and N55 engines. Symptoms include extended cranking, long start times, rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and potential engine stalling. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel pressure will likely be stored in the ECU.
    * Solution: Replacement of the HPFP is the typical solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Filter Housing Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: The oil filter housing gasket can leak, causing oil to drip onto other engine components. This can lead to a burning oil smell and low oil level.
    * Solution: Replace the oil filter housing gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**
