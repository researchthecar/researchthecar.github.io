The 2009 BMW Z4 (E89) is a two-seat roadster or coupe, known for its blend of sporty handling and luxurious features. This model year marked a significant departure from the previous generation with its retractable hardtop. The base model came with a 3.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-6 engine (Z4 sDrive30i) producing 255 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, while the higher-performance model featured a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine (Z4 sDrive35i) generating 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. An even higher performance version, the Z4 sDrive35is, featured a tuned version of the same turbo engine producing 335 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. Both manual and automatic transmissions were available, with the sDrive35i and sDrive35is offering a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) as an option. Owners appreciate the Z4's stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include the potential for costly repairs, limited storage space, and the firm ride quality, especially on models with the sport suspension.
