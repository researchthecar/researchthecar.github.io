The 2012 BMW Z4 is a stylish and sporty two-seat roadster, known for its engaging driving dynamics and luxurious features. The 2012 models were offered with three engine options: a 2.5-liter inline-6 producing 201 hp and 181 lb-ft of torque (Z4 sDrive28i), a 3.0-liter inline-6 producing 255 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque (Z4 sDrive30i), and a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 producing 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque (Z4 sDrive35i). A higher output version of the turbocharged 3.0 liter inline 6 producing 335 hp and 332 lb-ft of torque was also available in the Z4 sDrive35is. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic (DCT), depending on the engine configuration. Owners often praise the Z4's sharp handling, comfortable ride (relatively speaking for a roadster), and attractive styling. Some common criticisms include limited storage space, a sometimes harsh ride on rough roads, and potentially high maintenance costs associated with BMW ownership.
