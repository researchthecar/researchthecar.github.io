The most commonly reported technical issues tend to be related to the turbocharger systems on the higher-performance engines and potential glitches with the convertible top mechanism or the iDrive infotainment system. The automatic transmissions, especially the ZF 8-speed, are very reliable. While the M-DCT dual-clutch transmission can be prone to mechatronics issues, it's less common than general wear and tear. Overall, the Z4 is a dependable sports car, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific engine and transmission variants and their associated potential concerns.
