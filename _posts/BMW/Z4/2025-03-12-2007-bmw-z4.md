The 2007 BMW Z4 is a sporty two-seater roadster that offers a blend of performance and style. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-6 producing 174 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L inline-6 generating 215 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, and a higher-performance 3.0si inline-6 making 255 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices consisted of a 6-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic (2.5L only), and a 6-speed automatic. People appreciate the Z4's sharp handling, distinctive styling, and open-top driving experience.
