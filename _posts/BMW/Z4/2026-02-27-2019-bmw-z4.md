The 2.0L and 3.0L turbocharged engines, paired with the 8-speed automatic transmission, are generally robust. The chassis and suspension systems also appear well-engineered for this generation. The most commonly cited, though not widespread, issues tend to be minor electrical gremlins, such as occasional infotainment system glitches or, in some instances, premature battery drain. These are not indicative of systemic failures but rather typical early-production concerns that can often be resolved with software updates or component replacement. Overall, the Z4 offers a reliable platform for spirited driving, with potential buyers advised to be aware of the minor electrical possibilities.
