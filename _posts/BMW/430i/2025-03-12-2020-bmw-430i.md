**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (B46/B48)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various points, including the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing, and oil pan. Symptoms include visible oil on the engine, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or component. Thoroughly clean the affected area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the source and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are commonly reported. Coolant levels may drop and may need to be refilled regularly, or there may be a puddle of coolant under the car. The coolant may be a sweet-smelling liquid.
    *   Solution: A BMW mechanic should inspect all coolant pipes, reservoirs, and the water pump to pinpoint the location of the leak. The damaged or worn component should be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000 depending on the source and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can address the issue. In other cases, a transmission fluid change is necessary or, in more severe instances, replacement of valve body components or the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $500 (fluid change) - $2,000+ (valve body/transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the source and complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 BMW 430i is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil leaks, rough shifting, and electrical glitches with the iDrive system.
