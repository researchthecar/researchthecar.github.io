Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2021 BMW 430i, formatted as requested.

The 2021 BMW 430i is a sleek and sporty coupe, convertible, or Gran Coupe (four-door coupe) that offers a blend of performance and luxury. The 430i is primarily powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. An optional M440i model exists with a more powerful 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six. Both engines are typically paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 430i for its sharp handling, stylish design, and comfortable interior. Common criticisms include the somewhat cramped rear seats (especially in the coupe), the high price tag, and the overly firm ride on some models. Some drivers find the infotainment system complex.
