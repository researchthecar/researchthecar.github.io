The 2018 BMW 430i is a popular choice for those seeking a sporty and stylish coupe, sedan (Gran Coupe), or convertible. Powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, it produces 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, offering a good balance of performance and fuel efficiency. Other engine options available include the 440i models with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine.

Engine issues, such as oil and coolant leaks, are also relatively common but often repairable at reasonable costs. The transmission, although generally reliable, can exhibit rough shifting, potentially leading to valve body issues, which can be costly to repair.
