### Summary Verdict
The 2005 BMW 545i offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but its advanced engineering means potential owners should anticipate certain reliability concerns. The V8 engine is prone to oil leaks and requires attention to valve stem seals and the cooling system. Automatic transmission issues, particularly with the mechatronic unit and torque converter, are not uncommon. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, and electrical gremlins, especially with navigation and comfort features, can surface. While the manual transmission is generally more robust, the overall complexity of the 545i suggests that diligent maintenance and a budget for potential repairs are advisable for long-term ownership.
