### Summary Verdict
The 2004 BMW 545i offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but its complexity means potential owners should be prepared for specific reliability concerns. The V8 engine, while powerful, is prone to issues like valve stem seal wear and cooling system leaks, which can be costly to repair. Transmission reliability, particularly with the automatic, can also be a concern, with mechatronic unit and torque converter failures being notable. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the iDrive system and battery drain, are common. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, and active steering systems, if equipped, add another layer of potential expense. While the exterior and manual transmission are generally more robust, proactive maintenance and a budget for potential repairs are highly recommended for this model.
