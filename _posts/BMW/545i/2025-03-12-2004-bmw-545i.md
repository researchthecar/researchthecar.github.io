**Summary**

The 2004 BMW 545i, while a well-regarded car, has its share of common issues. The most concerning are typically related to the engine (valve stem seals, coolant leaks) and transmission (slipping, harsh shifting), which can lead to significant repair costs. Electrical problems, particularly with the iDrive system and various sensors, are also frequent. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, many can be costly due to the car's complexity and the labor involved. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, ideally having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified BMW mechanic.
