The 2015 BMW 520i is a popular luxury sedan, known for its blend of comfort, performance, and technology. It is part of the F10 generation of the 5 Series. In addition to the 520i, the 2015 5 Series was available with several other engine options, including the 528i, 535i, and 550i, along with diesel variants like the 520d. The 520i is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 184 horsepower and 270 Nm (199 lb-ft) of torque. Drivers often praise the car for its refined driving experience, comfortable interior, and elegant styling, while some criticisms include the sometimes-high maintenance costs associated with BMW ownership and potential complexity of the electronics.

*   **Rough Shifting:**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation, jerking, or hard shifts between gears.
    *   Solution: The first step is usually a transmission fluid change. If that doesn't resolve the issue, it may require valve body repair or replacement, or in severe cases, complete transmission replacement.

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Battery:**
