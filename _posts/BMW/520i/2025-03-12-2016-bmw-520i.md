    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gasket. The valve cover gasket and oil filter housing gasket are relatively straightforward, while the oil pan gasket replacement can be more involved.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the leak's location and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues (N20 Engine)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This mostly affects the N20 engine. Timing chain wear and potential failure. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and potential engine misfires or failure.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Sleeve Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks from the mechatronic unit sleeve, which seals the electrical connector to the transmission. Results in low transmission fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the mechatronic sleeve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW 520i, while a desirable vehicle, can present owners with several potential issues. The engine and transmission issues, particularly timing chain problems on the N20 engine and rough shifting on the ZF 8HP, can be costly to repair.
