The 2016 BMW Alpina B6 xDrive Gran Coupe is a high-performance luxury vehicle blending BMW's engineering with Alpina's bespoke enhancements. It came with a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 600 hp and 590 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and comfortable ride, potential owners should be aware of some common issues reported by owners. Owners generally dislike the high maintenance costs and potential for expensive repairs.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, oil filter housing gasket, and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine or ground, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty gasket or seal is the typical solution. This might involve removing surrounding components to access the affected area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can stem from the radiator, hoses, expansion tank, or water pump. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles.
    * Solution: The faulty component must be replaced. This can involve draining the coolant system and replacing the affected hose, tank, or pump.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or delayed shifting, particularly during upshifts or downshifts at lower speeds. Hesitation can also occur when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update might resolve minor issues. However, more severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush and software update) - $5,000+ (transmission rebuild).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can experience leaks in the air struts or lines, leading to a loss of ride height, uneven vehicle leveling, or compressor failure. Error messages on the dashboard are common.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air struts or lines is necessary. In some cases, the air compressor may also need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ per strut, plus additional costs for compressor replacement if needed.

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW Alpina B6 xDrive Gran Coupe, while a desirable performance sedan, can be prone to various issues. The most common problems revolve around engine oil and coolant leaks, transmission shifting irregularities, air suspension malfunctions, electrical glitches (particularly with the iDrive system), and failures in components like adaptive headlights and seat heaters. The severity and cost of these issues can vary significantly, from relatively inexpensive fixes like fluid flushes to costly repairs such as transmission rebuilds or air suspension replacements. Potential buyers should factor these potential expenses into their ownership considerations and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase.
