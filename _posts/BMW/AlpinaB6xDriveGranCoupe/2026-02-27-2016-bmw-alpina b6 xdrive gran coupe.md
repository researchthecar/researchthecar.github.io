### Summary Verdict
The 2016 BMW Alpina B6 xDrive Gran Coupe, while a remarkable performance machine, exhibits some potential reliability concerns typical of high-performance vehicles. The engine and transmission, particularly the complex V8 and its associated components like turbochargers and the automatic gearbox's mechatronic unit, are the most frequent sources of reported issues. The advanced suspension system, while enhancing driving dynamics, can also be a costly area for repairs if components like the Active Roll Stabilization fail. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are also noted. Exterior and interior components generally fare better with fewer widespread technical problems. Regular, diligent maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are crucial for maintaining the reliability and value of this exclusive automobile.
