The 2015 BMW Alpina B6 xDrive Gran Coupe is a high-performance luxury sedan that blends BMW's engineering with Alpina's unique styling and tuning. It was only offered in the North American Market with one engine option, a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 engine producing 540 horsepower and 540 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the B6 for its luxurious interior, exceptional performance, and refined driving experience. However, like any vehicle, it can be prone to certain issues.
