**Summary**

The 2016 BMW 328i xDrive, while generally a reliable vehicle, can suffer from several issues. The most concerning and potentially costly is the timing chain failure in the N20 engine. Oil leaks are also common. Transmission issues like rough shifting can also occur. Electrical problems with the iDrive system and door lock actuators are also noted. Interior issues such as cracked dashboards can detract from the vehicle's overall appeal. While some issues may be minor, the potential for expensive repairs should be considered when evaluating a used 2016 BMW 328i xDrive. Regular maintenance, including timely oil changes and transmission fluid flushes, can help mitigate some of these issues.
