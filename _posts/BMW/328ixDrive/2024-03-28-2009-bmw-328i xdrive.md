**Introduction**

The 2009 BMW 328i xDrive is a luxury sports sedan powered by a 3.0-liter inline-six engine producing 230 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. It comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission or an optional six-speed automatic transmission. The 328i xDrive is praised for its sharp handling, refined interior, and ample power. However, like any vehicle, it has some reported issues.

**Engine**

**3.0L Inline-Six Engine**

- **Vanos Solenoid Failure:** The variable valve timing (Vanos) solenoid controls the timing of the intake valves. Failure of the solenoid can lead to reduced engine power, rough idling, and increased emissions.
  - Solution: Replace the Vanos solenoid.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
  - Recalls: None Found

- **Valvetronic System Failure:** The Valvetronic system adjusts the valve lift instead of using a traditional throttle body. Failure of this system can result in engine performance issues, such as lack of power or stalling.
  - Solution: Inspect and replace any faulty components within the Valvetronic system.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
  - Recalls: None Found

- **Oil Filter Housing Gasket Leak:** The oil filter housing gasket can develop leaks over time, leading to oil loss and potential engine damage.
  - Solution: Replace the oil filter housing gasket.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
  - Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Manual Transmission**

- **Clutch Wear:** The clutch engages and disengages the engine from the transmission. Excessive wear on the clutch can lead to slipping or shuddering during gear changes.
  - Solution: Replace the clutch disc and pressure plate.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
  - Recalls: None Found

- **Transmission Fluid Leak:** A leak in the transmission housing or lines can result in loss of fluid and potential transmission damage.
  - Solution: Identify and seal the leak source.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
  - Recalls: None Found

**Six-Speed Automatic Transmission**

- **Transmission Control Module (TCM) Failure:** The TCM controls the automatic transmission's shifting. Failure of the TCM can lead to erratic shifting or transmission failure.
  - Solution: Replace the TCM.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
  - Recalls: None Found

- **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** The mechatronic unit is an integrated module that combines the TCM and hydraulic controls for the transmission. Failure of this unit can result in various transmission problems.
  - Solution: Replace the mechatronic unit.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
  - Recalls: None Found

  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
  - Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

- **Battery Discharge:** Some owners have experienced excessive battery discharge, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle.
  - Solution: Inspect the battery and charging system for potential problems.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
  - Recalls: None Found

- **Electrical Wiring Harness Issues:** Electrical wiring harnesses can develop problems, such as shorts or corrosion, resulting in electrical malfunctions.
