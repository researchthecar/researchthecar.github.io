The 2015 BMW 328i xDrive is a popular luxury sedan known for its blend of performance, comfort, and all-wheel-drive capability. Itâ€™s powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2015 3 Series include a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six (335i/340i) and a diesel engine (328d). Transmission options are either an 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual (though the manual is less common, especially with xDrive). Owners often praise the 328i xDrive for its engaging driving dynamics, fuel efficiency, and upscale interior. Common complaints often revolve around repair costs, some reliability issues, and the run-flat tires that contribute to a stiffer ride.

**Summary**

The 2015 BMW 328i xDrive, while generally a well-regarded vehicle, does suffer from some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine issues such as timing chain failure and oil leaks can be costly to repair, as can transmission problems with the 8-speed automatic. Suspension and electrical issues are less catastrophic but can still add to the overall cost of ownership. While some interior and exterior items could be bothersome, the biggest issues are in the drivetrain and could cost thousands of dollars. Overall, potential buyers should perform a thorough inspection and maintenance history review of the vehicle before purchasing, and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified BMW mechanic.
