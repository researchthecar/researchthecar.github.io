The 2011 BMW 328i xDrive is a popular entry-level luxury sedan known for its engaging driving dynamics and refined styling. The xDrive designation indicates it's equipped with BMW's all-wheel-drive system. It is powered by a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (N52) producing 230 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque.
