The 2014 BMW 328i xDrive is a popular luxury sedan known for its sporty handling, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. The 328i xDrive is primarily equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The rear-wheel drive 328i model had an available 6-speed manual transmission as an option, but the all-wheel drive xDrive model did not. Some owners appreciate the car's responsive engine and all-weather capability, while others dislike the relatively small rear seats and the potential for costly repairs as the car ages. This compilation focuses on the common issues reported by owners, specifically for the xDrive model equipped with the 2.0L turbo engine and 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front control arm bushings are prone to wear and tear, leading to vibrations in the steering wheel at higher speeds, clunking noises over bumps, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side, depending on whether just the bushings or the entire arm is replaced.

**Summary**

The 2014 BMW 328i xDrive is generally a reliable vehicle but is prone to several common issues as it ages. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine (oil leaks, timing chain), transmission (rough shifting), and electrical system (battery drain, iDrive glitches). These issues can lead to potentially costly repairs. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW mechanic to identify and address potential problems before they escalate. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs potentially exceeding several thousand dollars depending on the issue.
