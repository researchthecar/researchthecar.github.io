The 2010 BMW 328i xDrive is a popular choice for those seeking a blend of sporty handling, luxury features, and all-weather capability. It came equipped with a 3.0-liter inline-six engine (N52B30) producing 230 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the E90 3 Series generation included the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six in the 335i and a diesel engine in the 335d. Transmission choices included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 328i xDrive for its responsive handling, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. However, common complaints include higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles, potential for electrical gremlins, and certain engine-related issues, especially as the car ages.
