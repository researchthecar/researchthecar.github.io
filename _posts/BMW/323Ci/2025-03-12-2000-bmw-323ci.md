The 2000 BMW 323Ci is a sporty coupe known for its engaging driving dynamics and classic BMW styling. It's powered by a 2.5-liter inline-six engine, producing 170 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the E46 3-series include the 2.8-liter M52 inline-six (328Ci) and later, the 3.0-liter M54 inline-six (330Ci). The 323Ci came with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car's handling and responsiveness, but common complaints revolve around its maintenance costs and the age-related issues that surface in older vehicles.

**Summary**

The 2000 BMW 323Ci, while a fun car to drive, suffers from age-related issues common to many older BMWs. Cooling system problems, oil leaks, and suspension wear are typical concerns. Electrical issues, like window regulator and pixel failures, can also be frustrating. While individual repairs may not be overwhelmingly expensive, the cumulative cost of addressing these problems can make ownership more costly, particularly if multiple issues surface around the same time. Potential buyers should factor in these maintenance considerations and budget accordingly.
