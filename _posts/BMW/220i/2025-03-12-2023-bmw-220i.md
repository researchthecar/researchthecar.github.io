The 2023 BMW 220i is a sporty and stylish coupe that offers a blend of performance and luxury. While it boasts nimble handling and a premium interior, potential buyers should be aware of potential issues reported by owners. The 2023 220i is primarily powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 181 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Another, more powerful engine option that is available is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are exclusively paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the 220i's engaging driving dynamics and upscale feel, but some have voiced concerns about reliability and specific component failures.
