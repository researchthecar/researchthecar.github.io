Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2014 BMW 220i, categorized for clarity and accuracy, following the requested format.

The 2014 BMW 220i is a sporty and engaging coupe known for its sharp handling, responsive steering, and relatively fuel-efficient engines. The model offered two engine options: the 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (N20) and the 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (N26). The 2.0L N20 engine produced 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque in the 220i, while the N26, a SULEV (Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle) variant, was available in certain regions and shared similar performance figures. Both engine options were offered with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 220i is generally praised for its agile driving dynamics and compact size, making it fun to drive. However, potential drawbacks often include limited rear passenger space, a firm ride (especially with the sport suspension), and potential for higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles. Some drivers have also noted that while the engine is adequate, it can feel slightly underpowered at times compared to the 228i model.
