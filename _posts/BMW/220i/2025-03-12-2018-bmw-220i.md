The 2018 BMW 220i is a compact coupe known for its sporty handling and premium feel. In the US market, it was only offered with a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine (B48) producing 188 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People appreciate the 220i for its agile driving dynamics, stylish design, and relatively fuel-efficient engine. However, some common complaints include a firm ride, a small back seat, and the potential for expensive repairs due to BMW's complex engineering.
