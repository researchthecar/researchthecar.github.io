The 2016 BMW 220i is a sporty coupe known for its engaging driving dynamics and premium feel. The 220i comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful engine option for this vehicle is the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque in the 228i model. It comes standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its nimble handling, responsive steering, and refined interior. Common complaints include a somewhat firm ride and limited rear passenger space. While the 220i is generally considered reliable, like any car, it can have its share of issues.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported unexplained battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery. This can be caused by a faulty module not properly shutting down, a parasitic draw from an aftermarket accessory, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the battery drain and replace the faulty component. This may involve testing various modules to identify the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement. Diagnostic labor can vary widely (from $100 - $500+) depending on the complexity of the issue. Repairing or replacing a faulty module can add significantly to the cost.

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW 220i can suffer from issues ranging from minor trim problems to more significant engine concerns, especially with the N20 engine version. Owners should be aware of potential oil leaks and timing chain issues, especially if the engine sounds louder than usual. Electrical problems and iDrive system malfunctions are also possible, though less common. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. The most costly and severe issue is definitely the potential for timing chain failure on the N20 engine.
