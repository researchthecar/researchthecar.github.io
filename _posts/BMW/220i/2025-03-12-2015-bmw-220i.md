The 2015 BMW 220i is a sporty coupe known for its engaging driving dynamics and premium feel. In the North American market, the 220i is equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine (N20/B48), producing around 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available in some markets include the 228i/230i with a higher output 2.0-liter engine, and the M235i/M240i with a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine. Transmission choices generally consist of a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 220i for its nimble handling, responsive engine, and stylish design. Common complaints often revolve around repair costs and reliability compared to non-luxury brands.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (N20/B48)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, particularly from the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, and the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal. Thorough cleaning of affected areas is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the location of the leak and labor rates).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues (N20 Engine Only)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Primarily affects the N20 engine (early production 2015 models). Timing chain failure can occur due to premature wear of the chain guides. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, particularly on start-up, and potential engine misfires or stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, chain guides, and tensioner. Some mechanics recommend replacing sprockets too.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various locations, including the water pump, expansion tank, and coolant hoses. Signs include low coolant level, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking component (water pump, expansion tank, or hoses). Pressure test the system to identify all leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the component).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report occasional rough or jerky shifting, particularly during downshifts or at low speeds. This can sometimes be attributed to the transmission's adaptive learning.
    *   Solution: Resetting the transmission's adaptive learning may improve shifting smoothness. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can help. If the issue persists, valve body issues or internal transmission damage may be present.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reset) - $800+ (fluid/filter) - $2,000+ (valve body/repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit controls the shifting of the transmission. Failure of the unit can cause erratic shifting, failure to shift, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the mechatronic unit. The transmission may need to be reprogrammed or coded after the replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as the oxygen sensor, mass airflow sensor, and ABS sensor, can fail. Symptoms vary depending on the sensor but may include check engine lights, poor engine performance, or ABS/traction control issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that has failed and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the sensor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience excessive battery drain, particularly if the car is not driven frequently. This can be caused by parasitic drain from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard (Climate Related)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard material can develop cracks, especially in regions with high heat and sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $2,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 BMW 220i is generally a reliable vehicle but can be prone to certain issues, especially as it ages. The most common problems revolve around oil leaks and, for early models with the N20 engine, timing chain issues. Electrical sensor failures and minor transmission issues can also occur. Repair costs can be higher than non-luxury brands, making preventative maintenance important. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to more significant repairs that can be expensive, but overall the 220i has no major widespread issues that affect every vehicle.
