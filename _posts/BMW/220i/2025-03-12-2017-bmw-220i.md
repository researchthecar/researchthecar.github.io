The 2017 BMW 220i is a compact coupe known for its sporty handling and premium feel. This model year offered the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine, producing 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 230i was also available, offering 248 hp and 258 lb-ft. Transmission choices typically included a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic, depending on the market. Owners often praise the 220i for its nimble driving dynamics, comfortable front seats, and upscale interior. Common dislikes include the small rear seats, limited cargo space, and the cost of maintenance.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (N20/B48)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various seals and gaskets within the engine. Common areas include the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, and the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the vehicle, the smell of burning oil, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets and seals. Thoroughly clean the affected area to ensure a proper seal with the new gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the location of the leak and the labor involved)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues (Specifically N20 engines)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain in N20 engines, especially in earlier production years, has been known to stretch or fail prematurely. This can cause rattling noises from the engine, rough running, and potentially catastrophic engine damage if the chain breaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides. It's crucial to use updated parts to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (GA8HP45Z)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during gear changes can also occur.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can address the issue. However, if the problem persists, it may indicate wear or damage to the valve body, mechatronic unit or internal components requiring replacement or rebuild of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update $200 - $400, Valve body replacement/Transmission rebuild $2,500 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains faster than expected, especially if the car sits for a few days. This can be due to a faulty electrical component not shutting down properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the parasitic draw using a multimeter to identify the circuit causing the drain. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+, depending on the component and labor involved.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions with sensors (such as oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, or wheel speed sensors) can trigger warning lights on the dashboard. These failures can also cause performance issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor. Thorough diagnosis is needed to identify the specific sensor that is malfunctioning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (per sensor, including labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **iDrive System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can sometimes experience glitches, such as freezing, lagging, or unexpected reboots.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. In more severe cases, a software update or replacement of the iDrive control unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update $100-$300, Control Unit Replacement $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 BMW 220i presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from moderate to potentially severe. Engine-related issues, particularly oil leaks and timing chain problems (especially on the N20 engine), can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, electrical problems and iDrive glitches are also common and require maintenance to correct. While the 220i offers a sporty driving experience and premium features, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, including budgeting for potential repairs and maintenance.
