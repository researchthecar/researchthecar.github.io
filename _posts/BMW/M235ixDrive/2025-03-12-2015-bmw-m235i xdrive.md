The 2015 BMW M235i xDrive is a performance-oriented coupe/convertible known for its engaging driving dynamics, potent engine, and relatively compact size. The M235i was offered with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine (N55), producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either an 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission. The xDrive version denotes BMW's all-wheel-drive system. Owners typically praise the car's acceleration, handling, and overall fun factor. Common complaints revolve around a stiff ride (especially with the sport suspension), limited rear seat space (coupe), and potential for costly repairs as the car ages.
