The 2016 BMW M235i xDrive is a compact performance coupe known for its engaging driving dynamics and responsive handling. It's powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed manual transmission was available, but the xDrive model was exclusively offered with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the M235i for its powerful engine, agile handling, and luxurious interior, while common dislikes include the firm ride quality and potentially high maintenance costs associated with BMW vehicles.
