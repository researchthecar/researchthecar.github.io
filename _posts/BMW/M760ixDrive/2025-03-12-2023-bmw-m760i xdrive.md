    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride height, sagging suspension, error messages on the dashboard, and a harsh ride.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific component failure (air struts, compressor, or valve block) and replacing the faulty part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air struts: $1,000 - $2,500+ per strut; Compressor: $800 - $1,500+; Valve block: $500 - $1,000+

**Summary**

The 2023 BMW M760i xDrive, while a luxury marvel, can be prone to issues stemming from its complex technology and high-performance engine. Common issues involve oil leaks, transmission roughness, air suspension failures, and electrical glitches. These problems can range in severity, with some requiring relatively inexpensive fixes (software updates) and others demanding substantial investment (engine gasket replacement or suspension component replacements). The high cost of repairs and the potential for recurring issues should be considered when purchasing or maintaining this vehicle. While no recalls were found for this specific model year, staying informed about potential issues is crucial for ownership.
