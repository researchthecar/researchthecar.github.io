The 2023 BMW M8 Gran Coupe is a high-performance luxury sedan that blends stunning design with impressive power. The primary engine option is a 4.4-liter Twin-Turbo V8, producing 617 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque in the Competition trim. All M8 Gran Coupes are equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car's exhilarating acceleration, luxurious interior, and confident handling.
