# 2013 BMW 135is

### Overview
The 2013 BMW 135is, a performance-oriented variant of the 1 Series coupe, is generally regarded as a reliable vehicle, especially considering its sporty nature. It was offered with a potent turbocharged inline-six engine and a choice of manual or automatic transmissions, both of which are known for their robustness. While it shares some components with other BMW models of its era, the 135is benefits from specific tuning and a focus on driving dynamics. Owners generally report satisfaction with its performance and build quality, though like any performance car, maintenance and potential repairs can be more involved and costly than a standard commuter vehicle. This analysis focuses on common reported issues beyond routine maintenance.

### Summary Verdict
The 2013 BMW 135is offers a compelling blend of performance and driving pleasure. Its core mechanical components, particularly the N55 engine and the manual transmission, are generally robust. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as electric water pump failures and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to repair. The M-DCT automatic transmission, while offering rapid shifts, has a higher propensity for mechatronics and clutch pack issues. Electrical gremlins like iDrive glitches and window regulator failures are also noted. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the 135is can remain a reliable and enjoyable performance coupe.
