*   **Hesitation or Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates before engaging a gear, or it feels like the transmission is slipping during acceleration.
    *   Solution: This could be due to low transmission fluid level, worn clutch packs, or a faulty torque converter. A diagnostic scan and inspection of the transmission fluid are necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $4000+ (transmission replacement)
