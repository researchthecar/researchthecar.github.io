### Summary Verdict
The 2009 BMW 650i is a capable luxury vehicle, but potential owners should be aware of common issues, particularly with its V8 engine (valve stem seals, cooling system) and automatic transmission (mechatronic unit, torque converter). Electrical gremlins with the iDrive system and battery drain can also occur. The convertible top mechanism on convertible models is another area to inspect. While the suspension and interior are generally robust, specific components like the Active Roll Stabilization can be costly to repair if they fail. Regular maintenance and proactive checks for leaks and electrical anomalies are recommended to ensure the best ownership experience.
