**Engine**

**4.8L N62 V8**

*   **Coolant Transfer Pipe Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The coolant transfer pipe, located under the intake manifold, is made of plastic and can become brittle over time. This leads to coolant leaks, often noticed by a sweet coolant smell or low coolant levels. Overheating can result if the leak is severe.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the coolant transfer pipe with an upgraded aluminum version is the most common and reliable solution. This requires removal of the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Stem Seal Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: As the engine ages, the valve stem seals can harden and crack, leading to oil leaking into the combustion chamber. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, especially upon startup after the car has been sitting, and increased oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve stem seals. This is a labor-intensive job as it often involves removing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Various Locations)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The N62 engine is known for developing oil leaks from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and timing chain cover gasket. These leaks can cause oil consumption, a burning oil smell, and visible oil drips.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the location and complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit, which controls the shifting of the automatic transmission, can fail over time. Symptoms include harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, transmission slipping, or a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement or refurbishment of the mechatronic unit. It may also require adaptation/programming of the new unit to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ARS system, designed to reduce body roll during cornering, can develop leaks in the hydraulic accumulators or the hydraulic pump. This results in a warning light on the dash, reduced or no roll control, and potentially a noisy hydraulic pump.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking accumulators, hydraulic pump, or hydraulic lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Air Suspension Failure (Convertible Models)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 650i convertibles were equipped with rear air suspension. The air springs can develop leaks, leading to a sagging rear end, a noisy air compressor, and a warning light on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air springs or the air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system, which controls many of the car's functions, can experience various issues, including freezing, crashing, slow response times, and failure to connect to devices.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues, but more serious problems may require replacement of the iDrive control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 650i is known for its electrical system being sensitive to a weak battery. Parasitic drain can cause the battery to drain overnight, especially if the car is not driven regularly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic drain. This can involve checking for faulty modules or components that are not shutting down properly. Replacing the battery with a new, properly coded battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Issues (Convertible Models)**

The 2009 BMW 650i is a luxurious and enjoyable car to drive but is prone to various issues that can be costly to repair. Engine-related problems, particularly coolant leaks and oil leaks, are common and can be expensive. Transmission issues, especially with the mechatronic unit, are also a concern. Electrical gremlins, especially with the iDrive system and battery drain, can be frustrating. Suspension issues can range from moderate to severe in cost. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for costly repairs and factor this into their purchase decision.
