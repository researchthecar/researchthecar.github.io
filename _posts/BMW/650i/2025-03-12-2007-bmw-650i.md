**Engine**

**4.8L N62 V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a very common issue. These often originate from the valve cover gaskets, the alternator bracket gasket, the oil filter housing gasket, and the front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. Requires disassembly of related components to access and replace the affected parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the location and complexity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various locations including the coolant transfer pipe (the "valley pan" leak), radiator hoses, water pump, and expansion tank. Symptoms include low coolant level, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking components. Valley pan leaks can be particularly labor-intensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on the location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail prematurely, leading to a loss of power, battery drain, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Stem Seals**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn valve stem seals can cause excessive oil consumption, especially when the engine is cold. This often results in blue smoke from the exhaust upon startup.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve stem seals. This is a complex and labor-intensive repair that often requires removing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (ZF 6HP26)**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ZF 6HP26 transmission can experience slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, and general poor performance. This is often due to wear on the internal components such as the valve body or mechatronic unit, or contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change *may* improve the symptoms, but often requires rebuilding or replacing the valve body, mechatronic unit, or the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $4000+ (rebuild or replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Mechatronic Sleeve Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic sleeve is the seal between the transmission housing and the mechatronic unit. This seal is prone to leakage, and can leak transmission fluid onto the exhaust causing a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the mechatronic sleeve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with ARS, the system can develop leaks in the hydraulic lines, pump failure, or control unit malfunctions. Symptoms include a warning light on the dashboard, clunking noises from the suspension, and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking lines, pump, or control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the failed component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The control arm bushings can wear out, leading to vague steering, vibrations, and clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system can experience various issues, including screen freezing, system reboots, and failure to respond to inputs. This can be caused by software glitches or hardware failures.
    *   Solution: Software updates, module replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Comfort Access Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The comfort access system, allowing keyless entry and start, can be unreliable. Symptoms include the system failing to recognize the key, difficulty locking or unlocking the doors, and the car failing to start.
    *   Solution: Replacing the door handle sensors, key fobs, or the comfort access module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per door handle or module.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The car's battery may drain overnight due to faulty modules not properly going to sleep or an old battery.
    * Solution: Diagnose the module that is not going to sleep and replace, or replace the battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the module.
