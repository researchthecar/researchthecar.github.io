### Summary Verdict
The 2012 BMW 650i is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 4.4L twin-turbo V8 engine, while potent, can be prone to issues like turbocharger failure, fuel injector problems, and significant oil consumption, which can lead to costly repairs. The suspension's advanced systems, particularly the active roll stabilization, may require expensive maintenance. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive system malfunctions and battery drain, are also noted.
