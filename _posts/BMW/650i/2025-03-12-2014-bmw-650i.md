**Summary**

The 2014 BMW 650i offers a blend of luxury and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine oil and coolant leaks are prevalent, particularly with the N63TU engine, and transmission problems, especially with the ZF 8HP transmission, can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, such as battery drains and iDrive problems, can also be frustrating. Suspension and interior problems, while less common, can still contribute to the overall cost of ownership. Overall, while many issues are minor, the potential for significant repairs, particularly related to the engine and transmission, means prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified BMW mechanic.
