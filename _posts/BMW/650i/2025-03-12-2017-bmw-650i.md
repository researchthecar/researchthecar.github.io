The 2017 BMW 650i is a luxury grand tourer that offers a blend of performance, comfort, and style. It was available in coupe, convertible (Cabriolet), and four-door coupe (Gran Coupe) body styles. The main engine option for the 650i is a 4.4-liter TwinPower Turbo V8 engine, which produces 445 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. People often praise the 650i for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and smooth ride. Some common complaints include its high price tag, complex electronics, and potential for expensive repairs. While the 640i came with a turbocharged inline-6, this response will focus solely on the 650i with the V8 engine. A ZF 8-speed automatic transmission was standard.

**Summary**

The 2017 BMW 650i, while a desirable vehicle, has several potential issues that owners should be aware of. Engine-related problems, particularly oil and coolant leaks, are relatively common and can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues such as rough shifting can also occur. Electrical gremlins, especially those affecting the iDrive system, can be frustrating. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and the cost of repairs can be significant. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic experienced with BMWs to identify any existing or potential problems.
