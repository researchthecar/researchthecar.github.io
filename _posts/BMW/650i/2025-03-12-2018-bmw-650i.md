The 2018 BMW 650i represents a blend of luxury, performance, and grand touring capability. It's offered in Gran Coupe, Coupe, and Convertible body styles. The 650i is powered by a 4.4-liter TwinPower Turbo V8 engine producing 445 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. It's generally praised for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and stylish design. Some common criticisms include its large size, which can make it feel less agile than smaller BMW models, and the high cost of maintenance and repairs. While most of the engine components were the same, the available transmissions were an 8-speed Sport Automatic transmission with shift paddles, and a 6-speed manual transmission with the N63.
