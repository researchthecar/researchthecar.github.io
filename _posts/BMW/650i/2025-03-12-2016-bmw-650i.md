The 2016 BMW 650i is a luxury grand tourer available as a coupe, convertible, or Gran Coupe (four-door coupe). While appreciated for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and elegant styling, some owners have reported certain issues. The 2016 650i is equipped with a 4.4-liter TwinPower Turbo V8 engine producing 445 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options in the 6 Series range include a smaller inline-6, but the 650i specifically features the V8. All models use an 8-speed automatic transmission. Common owner complaints often revolve around the car's maintenance costs, particularly related to the complex electronics and potential for oil leaks. Conversely, owners praise the car's performance, comfortable ride, and attractive design.
