The 2018 BMW 330i xDrive is a popular luxury sedan known for its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and overall driving experience. It's powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options for the 2018 3 Series included the 320i with a slightly detuned version of the same 2.0-liter engine, the 340i with a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine. The 330e was also available which was a plug-in hybrid that combined the 2.0-liter inline-4 with an electric motor. All trims could be paired with an 8-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission except the 330e which was automatic only. Owners often praise the 330i xDrive for its engaging driving dynamics, fuel efficiency, and upscale cabin. However, some common dislikes include the run-flat tires (ride quality and replacement cost), the lack of a physical dipstick, and potential for electronic gremlins.
