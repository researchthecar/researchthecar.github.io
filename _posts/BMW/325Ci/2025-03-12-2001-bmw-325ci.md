**Engine**

**M54 2.5L Inline-6**

*   **VANOS Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, rough idle, engine stalling, and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to VANOS (Variable Nockenwellen Steuerung - variable camshaft timing). The seals within the VANOS unit degrade over time, causing improper oil pressure regulation and timing issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the VANOS seals with updated Viton seals. Some owners opt to replace the entire VANOS unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on DIY vs. professional repair and if only seals are replaced or the entire unit.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks, often originating from the water pump, thermostat housing, radiator, or expansion tank. The plastic components become brittle with age and are prone to cracking.
    *   Solution: Replace the entire cooling system, including the water pump (often with a metal impeller version), thermostat, thermostat housing, radiator, expansion tank, and hoses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+, depending on the extent of the replacement and DIY vs. professional repair.
