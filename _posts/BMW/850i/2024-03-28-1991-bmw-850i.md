**Introduction**

The 1991 BMW 850i is a grand tourer that was produced from 1991 to 1999. It was the flagship model of BMW at the time and was known for its sleek design, luxurious interior, and powerful engine. The 850i was available with a 5.0-liter V12 engine that produced 300 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. It was also available with a 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**5.0L V12**

* **Vanos system failure:** The Vanos system is responsible for controlling the timing of the valves. When it fails, it can cause a loss of power, rough idling, and increased fuel consumption. Solution: Replace the Vanos system. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
* **Head gasket failure:** The head gasket is a seal that prevents coolant and oil from leaking from the engine. When it fails, it can cause coolant and oil to leak into the cylinders, which can lead to major engine damage. Solution: Replace the head gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $4,000+
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner is responsible for keeping the timing chain tight. When it fails, it can cause the timing chain to slip, which can lead to catastrophic engine damage. Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Recall:** NHTSA Campaign Number 98V092000: Thermostat housing may crack and leak coolant

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch is responsible for transferring power from the engine to the transmission. When it fails, it can cause the car to slip or stall. Solution: Replace the clutch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter is a fluid coupling that transmits power from the engine to the transmission. When it fails, it can cause the car to shudder or slip. Solution: Replace the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
* **Transmission control module failure:** The transmission control module (TCM) is the computer that controls the transmission. When it fails, it can cause the transmission to shift erratically or not shift at all. Solution: Replace the TCM. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Recall:** NHTSA Campaign Number 01V116000: Transmission may overheat and fail

**Suspension**

* **Strut mount failure:** The strut mount is a bearing that connects the strut to the body of the car. When it fails, it can cause the strut to make noise or vibrate. Solution: Replace the strut mount. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Control arm bushing failure:** The control arm bushings are rubber bushings that connect the control arms to the body of the car. When they fail, they can cause the car to handle poorly and make noise. Solution: Replace the control arm bushings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator is responsible for charging the battery. When it fails, it can cause the battery to die and the car to stall. Solution: Replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Starter failure:** The starter is responsible for starting the engine. When it fails, it can cause the car to not start. Solution: Replace the starter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
