The 2000 BMW 323ti is a compact hatchback, known for its sporty handling and BMW driving experience in a smaller package. It was only offered with one engine option for the US market, a 2.5-liter inline-six (M52TUB25) producing approximately 170 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 323ti for its fun-to-drive nature, nimble handling, and relatively affordable price point. Common complaints revolve around the age of the vehicle, leading to increased maintenance and potential reliability issues typical of older BMWs.
