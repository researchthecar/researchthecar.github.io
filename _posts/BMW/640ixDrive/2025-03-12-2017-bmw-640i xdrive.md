The 2017 BMW 640i xDrive is a luxury grand tourer known for its blend of performance, comfort, and style. While it's a desirable vehicle, like any car, it's not without its potential issues. The 640i xDrive comes standard with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine producing 315 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 6 Series included a more powerful inline-6 in the 640i and a V8 in the 650i. All engine options for the 2017 6 Series were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 640i xDrive for its smooth ride, powerful engine, and luxurious interior. However, some common complaints include the high cost of maintenance, potential electrical glitches, and the car's somewhat large size making it less nimble than smaller BMW models.
