## 2014 BMW 640i xDrive

The 2014 BMW 640i xDrive is a luxury sports coupe that offers a refined driving experience and impressive performance. It is powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine that produces 315 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission.

Despite its impressive qualities, the 2014 BMW 640i xDrive has been plagued by several issues reported by owners. These issues range from minor annoyances to more serious problems that can affect the vehicle's performance and reliability.

## Engine
**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-Six**

* **Intake Valve Carbon Buildup:** Over time, carbon deposits can accumulate on the intake valves, which can lead to reduced engine performance, rough idling, and increased fuel consumption. The solution is to have the intake valves cleaned by a mechanic. Estimated cost: $300-$500.
* **Turbocharger Oil Leak:** A faulty turbocharger oil seal can cause oil to leak, which can lead to decreased engine performance and increased oil consumption. The solution is to replace the turbocharger oil seal. Estimated cost: $500-$1,000.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** A faulty timing chain tensioner can cause the timing chain to skip, which can lead to engine damage. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner and the timing chain. Estimated cost: $2,000-$3,000.
* **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure:** A faulty high-pressure fuel pump can cause the engine to lose power or stall. The solution is to replace the high-pressure fuel pump. Estimated cost: $1,000-$2,000.

**Transmission**
**Eight-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Hesitation:** Some owners have reported hesitation or jerking during gear shifts. The solution is to have the transmission software updated. Estimated cost: Free (under warranty) or $200-$300 (out of warranty).
* **Transmission Fluid Leak:** A faulty transmission fluid pan gasket can cause transmission fluid to leak, which can lead to decreased transmission performance and overheating. The solution is to replace the transmission fluid pan gasket. Estimated cost: $200-$300.

## Suspension
* **Strut Mount Failure:** Worn or damaged strut mounts can cause excessive noise, vibration, and handling problems. The solution is to replace the strut mounts. Estimated cost: $500-$700 per axle.
* **Control Arm Bushing Wear:** Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises, vibrations, and decreased handling performance. The solution is to replace the worn bushings. Estimated cost: $300-$500 per side.

## Electrical
* **Battery Discharge:** Some owners have reported that their batteries discharge quickly, even when the vehicle is not in use. The solution is to diagnose and repair the underlying electrical issue causing the discharge. Estimated cost: Varies depending on the issue.
* **Electrical System Malfunction:** A malfunction in the electrical system can cause a variety of symptoms, such as flickering lights, dashboard warning lights, and power loss. The solution is to diagnose and repair the faulty electrical component. Estimated cost: Varies depending on the issue.

## Exterior
* **Headlight Condensation:** Some owners have reported condensation buildup inside the headlights. The solution is to replace the affected headlights. Estimated cost: $1,000-$1,500 per headlight.

## Interior
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** Some owners have reported that the climate control system does not function properly, resulting in inconsistent or ineffective heating or cooling. The solution is to diagnose and repair the faulty component in the climate control system. Estimated cost: Varies depending on the issue.
