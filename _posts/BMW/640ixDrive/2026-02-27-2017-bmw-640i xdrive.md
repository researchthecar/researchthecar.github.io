### Summary Verdict
The 2017 BMW 640i xDrive is a well-built vehicle with a generally reliable powertrain. The 3.0L turbocharged inline-six engine and the 8-speed automatic transmission are robust and have few documented widespread issues. Potential concerns tend to lie within the more complex electronic and adaptive systems. Owners may encounter issues with the infotainment system (iDrive glitches), electrical drain leading to battery problems, and malfunctions in the adaptive suspension or headlights. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor and power seat actuators can also experience failures. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not indicative of systemic powertrain weaknesses. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are recommended for optimal long-term ownership.
