The 2024 BMW M135i xDrive is a performance-oriented hatchback that offers a blend of practicality and driving excitement. It is only offered with one engine type: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine which produces 302 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. The M135i xDrive comes exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the M135i's agile handling, powerful engine, and premium interior. Common dislikes include a firm ride, somewhat muted engine sound (compared to older BMW performance models), and a higher price point compared to some competitors. Some drivers have also noted that the car doesn't feel quite as engaging as older BMW models known for their raw driving experience.

*   **Stiff Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners complain about a firm and sometimes uncomfortable ride, especially on rough roads. This is often attributed to the M Sport suspension and low-profile tires.
    *   Solution: There is no specific fix, but options include switching to tires with a higher sidewall, installing aftermarket shocks with more comfort-oriented valving, or if possible, swapping out the M Sport suspension for a standard suspension (which is not usually a straightforward process).
