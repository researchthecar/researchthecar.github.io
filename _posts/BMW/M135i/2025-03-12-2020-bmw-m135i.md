A DCT transmission is used for this car.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (B48)**

*   **Coolant Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant level drops frequently, requiring top-ups. Visible coolant leaks may be present. Overheating may occur in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Pressure test the cooling system to identify leaks. Replace any leaking hoses, radiator, expansion tank, or water pump. The plastic coolant pipes may crack and cause a leak, in which case the coolant pipes need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine oil consumption. The oil level drops faster than expected between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may be present.
    *   Solution: Perform a compression test and leak-down test to check the condition of piston rings and valve stem seals. If these components are worn, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $7000+ (depending on severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Aisin)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, especially between lower gears. May be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the issue persists, the valve body may need to be inspected and rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3000+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into drive or reverse and the vehicle actually moving.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. Low fluid or contaminated fluid can cause this issue. If the fluid is good, internal transmission damage may be present, requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ride Harshness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A firm or uncomfortable ride, especially on rough roads. May be exacerbated by the optional sport suspension and larger wheels.
    *   Solution: Check tire pressures and ensure they are within the recommended range. Consider replacing run-flat tires with conventional tires for a more compliant ride. Aftermarket dampers can also be installed to improve the ride quality.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3000+ (depending on selected solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Creaking or Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Creaking or squeaking noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Inspect the suspension components for worn or damaged bushings, ball joints, and sway bar links. Replace any worn parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or exhibit other glitches.
    *   Solution: Perform a system reset. Update the infotainment software to the latest version. In severe cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $2000+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning sensors, such as parking sensors or tire pressure monitoring sensors (TPMS), may cause warning lights to illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is malfunctioning. Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises coming from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces.
    *   Solution: Locate the source of the rattle and apply foam padding or felt to eliminate the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (DIY or professional repair)
