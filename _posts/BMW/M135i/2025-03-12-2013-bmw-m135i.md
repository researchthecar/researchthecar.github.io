The 2013 BMW M135i is a rear-wheel-drive performance hatchback known for its blend of practicality and driving fun.

**Summary**

The 2013 BMW M135i is a generally reliable performance vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues with the engine, transmission, and suspension. The most concerning issues relate to the N55 engine (oil leaks, VANOS solenoids, HPFP failure) and the ZF 8HP transmission (mechatronic sleeve leaks), as these can be expensive to repair. Suspension issues like worn control arm bushings and shock absorbers are relatively common in vehicles of this age and mileage. Early diagnosis and repair are recommended to prevent further damage and maintain the M135i's performance.
