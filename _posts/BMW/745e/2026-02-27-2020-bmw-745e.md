### Summary Verdict
The 2020 BMW 745e presents a generally solid reliability profile, particularly for its gasoline powertrain and transmission. However, as a plug-in hybrid, the longevity and potential issues with the high-voltage battery system are a primary consideration, with degradation and replacement costs being significant factors. The advanced air suspension system, while offering superior comfort, can be a source of costly repairs if leaks develop. Electrical gremlins, especially within the complex infotainment system, are not uncommon and often require software solutions. Interior components like HVAC motors and seat actuators can also experience failures. Owners should be prepared for the higher maintenance costs associated with hybrid technology and luxury vehicle components.
