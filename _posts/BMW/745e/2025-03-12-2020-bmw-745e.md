The 2020 BMW 745e is a plug-in hybrid variant of the seventh-generation (G11/G12) 7 Series. It combines a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six gasoline engine with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 389 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other powertrain options for the 2020 7 Series include various gasoline and diesel engines, ranging from a 3.0-liter inline-six to a 6.6-liter V12, as well as all-wheel drive (xDrive) on some models. Owners generally appreciate the 745e for its blend of luxury, performance, and fuel efficiency, especially in electric-only mode for shorter commutes. Common dislikes include the reduced trunk space due to the battery pack, the complexity of the hybrid system leading to potential reliability concerns, and the higher initial cost compared to non-hybrid models.
