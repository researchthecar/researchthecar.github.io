The 2016 BMW X1 marked the beginning of the second generation (F48) of the popular compact SUV. This model year saw a significant change in design and platform from the previous generation. It's exclusively powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (B48), producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Available in both front-wheel drive (sDrive28i) and all-wheel drive (xDrive28i) configurations, the X1 is praised for its nimble handling, spacious interior for its class, and user-friendly technology. However, some owners have reported issues with reliability, particularly with the infotainment system, and some find the ride quality a bit firm.
