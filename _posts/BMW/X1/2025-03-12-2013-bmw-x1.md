The 2013 BMW X1 is a subcompact luxury crossover SUV that offers a blend of sporty handling and practicality. Available engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (240 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0-liter inline-6 (300 hp, 300 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are generally liked for their performance, with the turbo-4 providing ample power and the inline-6 delivering a more thrilling experience.
