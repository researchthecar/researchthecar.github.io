**2021 BMW X1**

The 2021 BMW X1 is a compact luxury SUV that is available with a range of engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four that produces 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. A plug-in hybrid powertrain is also available, which combines a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-three engine with an electric motor to produce a combined 225 horsepower.

The X1 is praised for its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and spacious cargo area. However, it is criticized for its firm ride quality and limited rear-seat legroom.
