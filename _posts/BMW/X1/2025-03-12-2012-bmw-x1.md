The 2012 BMW X1 is a compact SUV that offers a blend of practicality and BMW's signature driving experience. Available engine options included a 2.0L Turbocharged inline-4 (240 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0L inline-6 (300 hp, 300 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were either a 6-speed automatic or, in some models, a manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the X1's sporty handling, relatively fuel-efficient engines (especially the 2.0L turbo), and premium interior. Common complaints include a firm ride, limited rear passenger space, and potentially high repair costs.
