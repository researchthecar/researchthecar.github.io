**Engine**

**2.0-liter Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (B48)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms may include low oil warning lights and noticeable oil loss on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any leaks. If excessive consumption persists, diagnostic tests to check for worn piston rings or valve stem seals may be required. A leakdown test can help identify the source of the issue. If issues are found, the engine may need to be rebuilt, or at least have the bad part replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500+ for leak repairs. If major engine work is required, this could easily exceed $2000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Hesitation or Jerky Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or jerky shifts, particularly during low-speed acceleration or when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: A software update of the transmission control module (TCM) might solve the issue. If the problem persists, a mechanic may need to inspect the transmission for internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for a software update; $2000+ for major transmission repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes or crashes, requiring a restart. This can disrupt navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer. A hard reset of the system may also temporarily resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Free for software updates under warranty. Out of warranty, $100 - $300 for diagnostics and software updates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises From Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattling noises emanating from the dashboard area, particularly when driving on uneven road surfaces.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle (often loose trim pieces or wiring) and securing them properly. Applying felt tape to contact points can help dampen the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the complexity and labor required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2022 BMW 220i Gran Coupe has relatively few widespread issues reported, but owners have documented issues with oil consumption, transmission performance, and infotainment system glitches. While electrical and interior issues seem to be minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, more serious engine or transmission problems could lead to significant repair costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and ensure the vehicle has a clean maintenance history.
