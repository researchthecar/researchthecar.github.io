The 2023 BMW 220i Gran Coupe is a sporty and stylish compact four-door coupe. The standard engine in the 220i is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options for the 2023 2 Series Gran Coupe include a more powerful version of the 2.0-liter engine (in the M235i xDrive) and a diesel option in some markets. People generally appreciate the 220i Gran Coupe for its sharp handling, attractive styling, and premium interior. However, some criticize its relatively small rear seats and trunk space, as well as the sometimes firm ride.

**Summary**

The 2023 BMW 220i Gran Coupe, while generally well-regarded, does have some potential issues that owners should be aware of. The most common concerns revolve around engine coolant and oil leaks, occasional transmission roughness, electrical glitches with the iDrive system and battery drain, as well as some interior noise issues. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive (e.g., a software update or tightening loose trim), others, such as replacing a water pump, oil filter housing, or iDrive control unit, can be more costly. While no major recurring issues affecting safety have led to recalls, potential buyers should be aware of these reported problems and perform a thorough inspection before purchasing.
