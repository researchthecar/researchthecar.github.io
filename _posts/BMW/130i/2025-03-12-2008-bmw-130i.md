The 2008 BMW 130i is a rear-wheel-drive hatchback known for its engaging driving dynamics and powerful inline-six engine. In addition to the 3.0L N52 engine which produces 258 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque, other engine options include the 2.0L inline 4 and a higher-performance version of the 3.0L inline 6. Transmission options consist of a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 130i for its balanced handling, strong engine performance, and relatively compact size. Common criticisms include a firm ride, limited rear passenger space, and potential for higher maintenance costs compared to mainstream vehicles.

**Engine**

**3.0L N52 Inline-Six**

*   **VANOS Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, reduced power, check engine light. The VANOS (Variable Valve Timing) system is responsible for adjusting the camshaft timing. When the solenoids fail, they can cause issues with engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty VANOS solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak, burning oil smell, smoky exhaust. The valve cover gasket can become brittle over time and leak oil onto the exhaust manifold.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Housing Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak, visible oil around the oil filter housing, low oil level. The gasket between the oil filter housing and the engine block can degrade and leak.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil filter housing gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifts, hesitation when shifting, transmission slipping. This can be due to worn valve body components or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. Valve body repair or replacement may be required in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the severity of the issue and if valve body work is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise when driving over bumps, vague steering, uneven tire wear. The control arm bushings connect the control arms to the vehicle's frame. They can wear out over time and cause these issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car battery dies prematurely, difficulty starting the car. This can be caused by a faulty electrical component that is drawing power when the car is off.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the faulty electrical component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Window Regulator**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window does not go up or down, window goes up and down very slowly, grinding noise when window is going up and down.

**Summary:**

The 2008 BMW 130i, while praised for its driving dynamics, can suffer from several common issues. Engine issues like VANOS solenoid failure and gasket leaks are relatively common and can lead to moderate repair costs. Suspension issues, particularly with control arm bushings, can affect handling and comfort. Electrical problems, such as battery drain, can be frustrating. Interior trim stickiness is a known annoyance. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in potential maintenance costs when considering this vehicle. The severity and cost of repairs can vary, but addressing them promptly can help maintain the vehicle's performance and longevity.
