### Summary Verdict
The 2006 BMW 130i (E87) is a well-built performance hatchback with a strong inline-six engine. The most common non-wear-and-tear issues tend to revolve around the cooling system (water pump, thermostat), valve cover gasket leaks, and PCV valve failures, which are relatively common for BMWs of this era. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can be costly if the mechatronic unit or torque converter fails. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks may require attention as mileage increases. Electrical gremlins are less prevalent but can include window regulators and headlight sealing. Overall, the 130i offers good reliability for its performance class, provided these potential issues are addressed promptly.
