### Summary Verdict
The 2009 BMW 130i is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly its manual transmission variant. The inline-6 engine, while capable, can be prone to oil leaks from the valve cover and oil pan gaskets, as well as potential cooling system component failures over time. Automatic transmission models may experience issues with the mechatronic unit or torque converter. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and HVAC resistors, are also noted. However, these are often repairable and not indicative of systemic failure. With diligent maintenance and addressing minor leaks promptly, the 130i can offer a rewarding ownership experience.
