The 2010 BMW 130i is a rear-wheel-drive hatchback known for its engaging driving dynamics and potent inline-six engine. The primary engine option for this model year was the 3.0L N52 naturally aspirated inline-six, producing around 258 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices typically included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the 130i for its responsive handling, strong engine performance, and relatively compact size, making it a fun and practical car for everyday use. Some common criticisms include a firm ride, especially on sport-tuned suspensions, and higher maintenance costs compared to other vehicles in its class.
