The 2021 BMW M240i is a performance-oriented coupe or convertible that offers a compelling blend of agility, power, and luxury. The M240i comes standard with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine (B58) producing 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission offered is an 8-speed automatic. Many owners appreciate the M240i for its rapid acceleration, sharp handling, and relatively compact size, making it fun to drive on both city streets and winding roads. Some common complaints include a firm ride (especially with the optional adaptive suspension), limited rear seat space, and some may find the interior styling to be somewhat dated compared to newer BMW models.
