The 2018 BMW M240i is a popular compact sports car known for its performance and handling. It came standard with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 engine, producing 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. The M240i is generally well-regarded for its engaging driving experience, powerful engine, and relatively practical size. Common criticisms include the sometimes-firm ride, the less-than-stellar interior quality for the price point, and the somewhat subdued exhaust note. The M240i is considered an upgrade to the 230i, but is a step below the M2.
