The 2019 BMW M240i is a popular choice for driving enthusiasts due to its blend of performance and practicality. It's powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (B58) producing 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. People generally appreciate its nimble handling, powerful engine, and relatively compact size. However, some criticisms include a somewhat firm ride, especially on rough roads, and the interior design being considered less luxurious than some competitors.
