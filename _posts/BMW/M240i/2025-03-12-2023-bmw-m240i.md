The 2023 BMW M240i is a performance-oriented compact coupe/convertible praised for its engaging driving dynamics and powerful engine. It comes standard with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 engine (B58) producing 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. All models are equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission.
