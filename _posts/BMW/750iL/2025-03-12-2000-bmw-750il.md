The 2000 BMW 750iL is a luxurious and powerful full-size sedan, known for its smooth ride and sophisticated features. The primary engine option is a 5.4-liter V12 engine producing 322 horsepower and 361 lb-ft of torque. While there were other engines available such as the 4.4-liter V8 found in the 740i and 740iL models, the V12 distinguishes the 750iL as the top-of-the-line model. All engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car's comfortable interior, strong acceleration, and elegant styling. Common complaints revolve around the high cost of maintenance and repairs, especially as the car ages, and the complexity of the electronics.
