**5-Speed Automatic (A5S 560Z)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5-speed automatic transmission can experience slipping between gears or harsh/jerky shifts. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and fluid change *may* resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, a valve body rebuild or transmission rebuild/replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (flush), $500 - $1500 (valve body rebuild), $2500 - $5000+ (rebuild/replacement).

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with air suspension can suffer from leaking air struts, a faulty air compressor, or a defective ride height sensor. This results in a sagging or uneven ride height, a noisy compressor, and a rough ride.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air struts, the faulty air compressor, or the defective ride height sensor. Some owners convert to traditional coil springs for a more reliable and less expensive solution.
