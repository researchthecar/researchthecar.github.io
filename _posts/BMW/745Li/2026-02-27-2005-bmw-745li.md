### Summary Verdict
The 2005 BMW 745Li is a luxurious and powerful vehicle, but its complexity translates to potential reliability concerns, particularly in its advanced engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Common issues include coolant leaks from the valley pan gasket, oil leaks, and VANOS system problems for the engine. The transmission can suffer from fluid leaks and mechatronic unit failures. Electrically, the iDrive system, Body Control Module, and parking sensors are known to cause headaches. Suspension components, especially the adaptive systems, can also be costly to repair. While the exterior is generally robust, interior climate control and seat components can fail. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance and repair costs compared to less complex vehicles.
