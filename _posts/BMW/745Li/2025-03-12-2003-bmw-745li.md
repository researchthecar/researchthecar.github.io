The 2003 BMW 745Li, part of the E65/E66 generation, marked a significant departure in BMW design. It was available with a 4.4L N62 V8 engine producing 325 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. A shorter wheelbase version, the 745i, was also available with the same engine. A larger 6.0L V12 engine was used in the 760i and 760Li versions. All models used a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the car's luxurious features, comfortable ride, and advanced technology for its time, but often found the iDrive system confusing and reliability to be a concern. The complex electronics and relatively short lifespan of some components resulted in numerous maintenance issues.

**Engine**

**4.4L N62 V8**

* **Valve Stem Seal Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, especially after the car has been sitting.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve stem seals.

    * Solution: Replacing the mechatronic sleeve and refilling the transmission fluid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The car sitting unevenly, a warning light on the dashboard, the air compressor running constantly, or the car not raising or lowering properly.
    * Solution: Replacing the air struts, air compressor, or ride height sensors. Leaks in the air lines can also cause problems.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Air Strut Replacement - $800 - $1,500+ per strut, Air Compressor Replacement - $500 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Control Arm Bushing Failure**

    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The iDrive screen freezing, rebooting, or displaying error messages. Buttons and the iDrive controller may become unresponsive.
    * Solution: This can be caused by a variety of issues, including software glitches, a failing iDrive controller, or problems with the Central Information Display (CID). Sometimes a software update can resolve the issue, but often requires replacing faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update - $100 - $300, iDrive Controller Replacement - $500 - $1,000+, CID Replacement - $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery draining quickly, especially if the car sits for a few days. Can be caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty module or component.
    * Solution: Requires diagnosing the source of the drain and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    * Recalls: None Found
