### Summary Verdict
The 2004 BMW 645Ci is a capable grand tourer, but its advanced technology and V8 engine mean potential owners should budget for maintenance and repairs. The most significant concerns revolve around the cooling system, with leaks being common due to age and material degradation. Valve stem seals and oil pan gaskets are also known weak points that can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, particularly with the mechatronic unit and torque converter, can arise. Electrical gremlins, especially with the iDrive system and battery drain, are not uncommon. While the suspension and exterior are generally robust, interior components like the headliner can show wear. Regular, proactive maintenance is key to mitigating these potential issues and ensuring the longevity of this luxurious coupe.
