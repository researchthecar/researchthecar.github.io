The M4 Competition boasts even more power, delivering 444 horsepower. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic (DCT). Owners appreciate the M4's exhilarating performance and sporty driving experience, but some criticize its firm ride, particularly on rough roads, and the complicated iDrive infotainment system. The car is praised for being very quick and capable while also being fun to drive. It is often criticized for its ride being too rough for a daily driver.

**Engine**

**S55 3.0L Twin-Turbo Inline-Six**

*   **Crank Hub Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S55 engine is known for potential crank hub issues, where the friction-based crank hub can slip, causing timing misalignment. This can lead to a loss of power, engine misfires, and potentially catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include check engine lights, rough running, and a noticeable decrease in performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the factory crank hub with a pinned or upgraded aftermarket crank hub is the common fix. This reinforces the connection between the crankshaft and the timing gear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on shop and extent of damage).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket, Oil Filter Housing)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are fairly common as the car ages. Common leak locations are the valve cover gasket and the oil filter housing. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gasket and/or oil filter housing gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on location and shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **DCT Mechatronics Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DCT mechatronics unit, responsible for controlling the transmission's hydraulic system, can sometimes fail. Symptoms include harsh or jerky shifting, failure to shift gears, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the mechatronics unit is the typical solution. This involves removing the transmission, accessing the mechatronics unit, and installing a new or refurbished unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: M4s equipped with the Adaptive M Suspension can experience damper failures. This can result in a bouncy or unstable ride, uneven tire wear, and a noticeable decrease in handling performance. Error messages related to the suspension system may also appear.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty adaptive damper(s). It's often recommended to replace dampers in pairs (left and right) to maintain even handling characteristics.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ (per damper, including labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can experience glitches, including freezing, slow response times, and connectivity issues with mobile devices.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often the first step in addressing iDrive issues. In more severe cases, the iDrive control unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) to $1,000+ (for control unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Parking Sensors, TPMS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sensor failures, such as malfunctioning parking sensors or tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensors, can occur. Symptoms include error messages, inaccurate readings, or non-functional systems.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (per sensor, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Carbon Fiber Roof Delamination (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: M4s equipped with the optional carbon fiber roof can experience delamination, where the clear coat separates from the carbon fiber. This appears as cloudy or peeling areas on the roof.
    *   Solution: Refinishing the carbon fiber roof or, in severe cases, replacing the roof panel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Belt Assistant Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat belt assistant, which extends the seat belt arm to make it easier to reach, can sometimes malfunction. It may fail to extend or retract properly.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the seat belt assistant mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 BMW M4 is a thrilling performance machine, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The crank hub failure in the S55 engine is a significant concern due to the potential for severe engine damage. DCT mechatronics failures and adaptive damper issues can also be costly to repair. While less critical, electrical glitches and sensor failures can be frustrating. Overall, prospective owners should factor in the potential for these repairs when considering the purchase of a used 2020 BMW M4 and consider a pre-purchase inspection.
