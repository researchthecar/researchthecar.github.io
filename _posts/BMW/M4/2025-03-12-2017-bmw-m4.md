The 2017 BMW M4 is a high-performance sports car lauded for its sharp handling, powerful engine, and stylish design. It's powered by a 3.0-liter TwinPower Turbo inline-six engine producing 425 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque in its standard configuration. An optional Competition Package bumps the power up to 444 horsepower. Transmission choices include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed M-DCT (Dual Clutch Transmission). Drivers appreciate the M4's engaging driving experience and sporty aesthetics, but some common criticisms include a harsh ride, especially on rough roads, and potentially high maintenance costs associated with its performance-oriented components.

**Engine**

**S55 3.0L Twin-Turbo Inline-Six**

*   **Charge Air Cooler Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the charge air coolers, which are integrated into the intake manifold. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty charge air cooler. Improved designs are available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various areas, including the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing, and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on location

*   **Crank Hub Failure (Preventative)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While not always a guaranteed failure point, the S55 engine is known to have a weak crank hub design. High power output, especially with tunes, can cause the crank hub to slip, leading to timing issues and potentially catastrophic engine damage. This is more of a preventative measure.
    *   Solution: Install a keyed crank hub or upgraded single-piece crank hub.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting, particularly at low speeds or during cold starts. Clunking noises can also be present during gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can improve shifting smoothness. In more severe cases, clutch replacement or DCT unit repair may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 (Software), $3000 - $10000+ (Clutch/DCT Repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**
