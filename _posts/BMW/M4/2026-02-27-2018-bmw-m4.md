### Summary Verdict
The 2018 BMW M4 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, with a generally solid reliability record for its class. The powerful S55 engine, while potent, has a few documented issues such as wastegate rattle and potential oil leaks, which are not uncommon for high-output turbocharged engines. The M-DCT transmission, while offering rapid shifts, can be prone to mechatronics unit failures or clutch wear, representing a significant repair cost if issues arise. The manual transmission is typically more robust. Suspension components, particularly the adaptive dampers, can be a source of concern. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. Overall, the M4 is a reliable performance car, but owners should be aware of potential costs associated with its high-performance systems, especially the transmission and adaptive suspension.
