The 2016 BMW M4 is a high-performance sports coupe/convertible that boasts a thrilling driving experience. It is powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six engine, producing 425 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque in its standard configuration. An optional Competition Package increased power to 444 hp. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic (DCT). Owners often praise the M4 for its sharp handling, powerful engine, and aggressive styling. Criticisms typically revolve around the firm ride, particularly with the Competition Package, and the sometimes artificial feel of the steering.
