The 2009 BMW 128i is a popular compact coupe and convertible known for its engaging driving dynamics and classic BMW styling. It was offered with a single engine option, the naturally aspirated 3.0-liter inline-six (N52B30) producing 230 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the 128i for its balanced handling, responsive engine, and relatively simple (compared to other BMW models) mechanicals.
