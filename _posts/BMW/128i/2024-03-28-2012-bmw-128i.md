**Summary**

The 2012 BMW 128i is generally considered a reliable and enjoyable vehicle, but it has had some issues reported by owners. The most common problems are related to the engine, such as valve cover gasket leaks and timing chain tensioner failures. The transmission can also experience fluid leaks, especially with the automatic option. Suspension components, such as control arm bushings and shock absorbers, may also require replacement over time. Electrical issues, including tail light wiring harness faults and battery discharge, have also been reported. While some of these issues can be relatively minor, others can be more expensive to repair, so it is recommended to factor these potential costs into ownership considerations.
