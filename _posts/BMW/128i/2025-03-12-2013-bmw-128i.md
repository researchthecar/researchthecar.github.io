The 2013 BMW 128i is a compact coupe and convertible praised for its engaging driving dynamics, balanced handling, and classic BMW styling. It comes equipped with a naturally aspirated 3.0-liter inline-six engine (N52B30) producing 230 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque.

**Summary**

The 2013 BMW 128i is a generally reliable vehicle, but like most European cars, it is prone to certain issues as it ages. The most common problems revolve around oil leaks, suspension components, and electrical gremlins. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive (e.g., VANOS solenoid replacement), others can be quite costly (e.g., subframe repairs or transmission work). Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified BMW mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems. Being proactive with maintenance and addressing issues promptly can help minimize repair costs and ensure long-term reliability.
