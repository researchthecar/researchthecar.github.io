The 2004 BMW 330xi is part of the E46 generation, known for its blend of sporty handling, comfortable ride, and timeless design. It came equipped with a 3.0-liter inline-six engine (M54B30), producing 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the E46 generation include a smaller 2.5-liter inline-six in the 325i and a more powerful 3.2-liter inline-six in the M3. The 330xi specifically came standard with a 5-speed automatic transmission, although a 5-speed manual was also available. Owners often praise the E46's responsive steering, balanced chassis, and engaging driving experience. However, common complaints include the cost of maintenance and repairs, potential for electrical issues, and the age-related wear and tear that affects many components in a vehicle of this vintage.

**Engine**

*   **Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The GM A5S390R automatic transmission can experience slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, and overall poor performance as it ages. This is often due to worn valve body components or low fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced, or the entire transmission may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (transmission replacement)
