The 2006 BMW 330xi is part of the E90 generation, known for its blend of sporty handling and luxury features. The 330xi specifically features all-wheel drive, enhancing its grip and stability, especially in inclement weather. For the 2006 model year, the 330xi was equipped with the 3.0L inline-6 naturally aspirated engine producing 255 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the E90 generation included the 325i (2.5L inline-6), and the 335i (3.0L twin-turbo inline-6). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 330xi for its responsive engine, balanced chassis, and comfortable interior. Common complaints revolve around higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury brands, and some reported issues with electrical components and certain engine-related parts as the vehicle ages.
