The 2001 BMW 330xi is part of the E46 generation, known for its blend of sporty handling and luxury features. The 330xi specifically features all-wheel drive, making it a popular choice for those in climates with challenging weather. The primary engine available in the 2001 330xi is the 3.0-liter M54 inline-six, producing 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. While the E46 is appreciated for its driving dynamics and classic BMW styling, some common complaints include electrical gremlins, cooling system issues, and suspension wear. Some owners also find the maintenance costs associated with BMW ownership to be higher than average. Transmission options are a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2001 BMW 330xi, while a desirable car for its performance and handling, does suffer from a range of common issues. Cooling system and suspension problems are prevalent and can be moderately expensive to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulator failure and instrument cluster pixel loss, are also common. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but preventative maintenance and addressing problems promptly can help mitigate long-term expenses. Rust can also be a problem in certain climates. The most expensive potential issues stem from transmission problems, particularly with the automatic transmission.
