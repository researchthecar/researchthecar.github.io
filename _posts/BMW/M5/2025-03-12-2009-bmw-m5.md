The 2009 BMW M5 (E60) is a high-performance sedan known for its exhilarating driving experience. The sole engine option for this model year is the naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V10 engine (S85) producing 500 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed SMG (Single Clutch Automated Manual) transmission. People rave about the V10's unique sound and performance, but reliability concerns and high running costs are commonly cited drawbacks. Owners also appreciate the car's handling and luxurious interior, but some find the SMG transmission jerky and the car's electronic systems complex.

**Engine**

**5.0L V10 (S85)**
*   **Rod Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking sound from the engine, especially at idle or low RPMs. This is often caused by excessive wear on the connecting rod bearings due to inadequate lubrication. If left unaddressed, this can lead to catastrophic engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rod bearings with either OEM or upgraded aftermarket bearings is the standard fix. Some owners also upgrade the oil pump or oil pressure relief valve at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Throttle Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S85 engine has individual throttle actuators for each cylinder bank. When one fails, the engine can run rough, go into limp mode, and display error codes related to throttle control.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty throttle actuator is necessary. It's often recommended to replace both actuators simultaneously as preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VANOS (Variable Camshaft Timing) system can experience issues such as solenoid failure, high pressure oil line leaks, or a failing VANOS pump. Symptoms include poor performance, rough idle, and VANOS-related error codes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific VANOS component that is failing and replacing it. This could involve replacing solenoids, the VANOS pump, or the high-pressure oil line.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the part needed
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, especially from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and the oil filter housing gasket.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on location of leak
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed SMG (Single Clutch Automated Manual)**
*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMG transmission relies on a hydraulic pump to build pressure for shifting. The pump can fail over time, leading to slow or erratic shifts, difficulty engaging gears, and SMG error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the SMG hydraulic pump and potentially the hydraulic fluid reservoir.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the nature of the SMG system, clutch wear is a common issue. Symptoms include slipping, difficulty engaging gears, and jerky shifts. Aggressive driving and launch control usage can accelerate clutch wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch and potentially the flywheel. SMG clutch replacement requires specialized tools and expertise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SMG Software Glitches/Faulty Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMG system is complex and relies on sensors and software to function properly. Glitches or faulty sensors can lead to erratic shifting behavior, error codes, and a general lack of smooth operation.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific sensor or software issue and either replacing the sensor or reflashing the SMG control module with updated software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**
*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **EDC (Electronic Damper Control) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The M5's EDC system can experience damper failure, leading to a harsh ride, poor handling, and EDC warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty EDC dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system can experience various issues, including software glitches, screen failures, and control knob malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Software updates, screen replacement, or control knob replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur due to faulty modules, parasitic draws, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the battery drain and addressing the underlying issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: TPMS sensors can fail or malfunction, leading to false warnings or inaccurate tire pressure readings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty TPMS sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Adaptive Headlight Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adaptive headlights can experience motor failures, leading to them not adjusting properly or displaying error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty headlight motor or the entire headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power seat motors can fail, preventing the seat from adjusting properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty seat motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroofs can experience motor failures or track issues, leading to difficulty opening or closing.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the sunroof motor or track.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2009 BMW M5 is a complex and high-performance vehicle that can be expensive to maintain. The most severe and costly issues relate to the engine (rod bearings, throttle actuators, VANOS) and the SMG transmission (hydraulic pump, clutch). Electrical gremlins and suspension issues are also common. Potential buyers should factor in these potential repair costs when considering purchasing this vehicle, and should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified BMW mechanic.
