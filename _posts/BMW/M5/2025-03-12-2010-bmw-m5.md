The 2010 BMW M5, part of the E60 generation, is a high-performance sedan known for its distinctive naturally aspirated 5.0L V10 engine, producing 500 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. It was offered with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed SMG (Single Clutch Automated Manual) transmission. Owners often praise the M5 for its exhilarating performance, distinctive engine sound, and luxurious interior. Common complaints include the car's high running costs (fuel, maintenance), complex electronics that can be prone to failure, and the SMG transmission's sometimes jerky operation, particularly at low speeds.

**Engine**

**S85 5.0L V10**

*   **Rod Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking sound from the engine, especially noticeable at idle. This is due to excessive wear on the connecting rod bearings, often caused by insufficient oil lubrication. Can lead to catastrophic engine failure if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the connecting rod bearings with updated versions that have improved oiling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Throttle Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine malfunction light, reduced power, rough running, or complete engine shutdown. The S85 engine has individual throttle actuators for each cylinder bank, and they are prone to failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty throttle actuator(s). It's recommended to replace both at the same time to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine malfunction light, rough idle, reduced power, poor fuel economy, and/or unusual engine noises. The VANOS (Variable Nockenwellen Steuerung, or Variable Camshaft Timing) system is complex and has several components (solenoids, high-pressure oil pump, etc.) that can fail over time.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific VANOS component that is failing and replace it. This could involve replacing VANOS solenoids, the high-pressure oil pump, or other related parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Control Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Unstable or fluctuating idle.
    *   Solution: Replace the Idle Control Valve
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed SMG (Single Clutch Automated Manual)**

*   **SMG Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission malfunction light, inability to shift gears, jerky shifting, or complete transmission failure. The SMG system relies on a hydraulic pump to build pressure for shifting, and these pumps are prone to failure over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the SMG pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SMG Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, jerky engagement, difficulty shifting, or complete inability to move the vehicle. The SMG clutch is a wear item and will eventually need replacement.
    *   Solution: Replace the SMG clutch, pressure plate, and potentially the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SMG Hydraulic Line Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission malfunction light, difficulty shifting, or visible hydraulic fluid leaks under the vehicle. The SMG system uses hydraulic lines to transmit pressure, and these lines can become brittle and leak over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking hydraulic lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **EDC (Electronic Damper Control) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: EDC malfunction warning, uneven ride quality, or clunking noises from the suspension. The EDC system allows the driver to adjust the suspension stiffness, and the dampers can fail over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty EDC dampers. It's recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Thrust Arm Bushings Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibration when braking, especially at high speeds. The thrust arm bushings connect the front suspension to the chassis and can wear out over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the thrust arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive Controller Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the iDrive system (navigation, audio, climate control). The iDrive controller knob can become faulty.
    *   Solution: Replace the iDrive controller.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, especially after the car has been sitting for a few days. This can be caused by a faulty module not going into sleep mode or a parasitic draw.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This could involve replacing a faulty module or repairing wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause, $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery light on the dashboard, dimming headlights, or complete electrical failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Tail Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bulbs burning out frequently. Corrosion.
    *   Solution: Replace the tail light assembly or clean the contacts and repair wiring as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Seat unable to move or adjust.
    * Solution: Replace the seat motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 BMW M5, while an impressive performance machine, is known for its potential for expensive repairs. The most significant issues revolve around the S85 V10 engine (rod bearings, throttle actuators, VANOS) and the SMG transmission (pump failure, clutch wear). Electrical problems and suspension issues are also common. Potential owners should be prepared for significant maintenance costs. The severity of the issues can range from moderate inconvenience to complete component failure, leading to repair bills ranging from a few hundred dollars to upwards of $5,000+ for major engine or transmission work.
