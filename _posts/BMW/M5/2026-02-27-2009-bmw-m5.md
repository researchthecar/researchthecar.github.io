### Summary Verdict
The 2009 BMW M5 is a performance icon with a powerful V10 engine and engaging SMG transmission. However, its complexity translates to specific reliability concerns, most notably potential rod bearing failure in the V10 engine and issues with the SMG transmission's hydraulic system and actuators. The advanced Adaptive Drive suspension can also be a source of expensive repairs. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, the mechanical and electronic systems require diligent maintenance and can incur significant repair costs. Prospective owners should budget for potential high-cost repairs, especially concerning the powertrain and suspension.
