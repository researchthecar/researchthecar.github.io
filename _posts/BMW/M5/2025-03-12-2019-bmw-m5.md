**Summary**

The 2019 BMW M5, while a performance powerhouse, is not without its potential issues. Engine oil leaks and potential VANOS solenoid issues present some of the more serious mechanical concerns. Electrical gremlins in the iDrive system and potential sensor malfunctions can also be frustrating. Suspension and transmission problems are less common but can be expensive to repair. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls. While some issues are relatively minor and easily addressed with software updates or inexpensive part replacements, others can be significantly more costly and may impact the ownership experience. A thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
