The 2006 BMW M5 (E60) is a high-performance sedan that made a significant impact with its Formula 1-inspired 5.0-liter V10 engine. This engine produces 500 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox). Owners often praise the M5 for its exhilarating performance, distinctive engine sound, and engaging driving experience. However, common complaints include high running costs, complex electronics, and the potential for expensive repairs, especially related to the SMG transmission and the V10 engine itself.

**Engine**

**5.0L S85 V10**

*   **Rod Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking sound coming from the engine, especially when cold. The issue is due to inadequate lubrication of the rod bearings, leading to excessive wear and potential engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rod bearings with upgraded bearings (e.g., coated bearings) and ensuring proper oil viscosity and oil change intervals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Throttle Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, rough idle, and the "Service Engine Soon" light illuminating. The issue stems from the throttle actuators failing due to wear and tear or electrical faults.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty throttle actuator(s). The S85 engine has two throttle actuators.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on if one or both are replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS High-Pressure Oil Line Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, increased engine noise, and potential oil leaks. The VANOS (Variable Nockenwellen Steuerung) system is BMW's variable valve timing system. The high-pressure oil line supplying the VANOS system can fail due to age and heat, resulting in oil starvation and potential damage to the VANOS units.
    *   Solution: Replacing the high-pressure oil line with an updated line, often made of stainless steel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox)**

*   **SMG Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, the transmission going into neutral unexpectedly, and the SMG warning light illuminating. The SMG pump provides hydraulic pressure to the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacing the SMG pump and potentially the hydraulic fluid reservoir.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SMG Clutch Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, jerky gear changes, and difficulty engaging or disengaging the clutch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch actuator or rebuilding it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SMG Hydraulic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure, inability to shift gears, and numerous SMG error codes. The hydraulic unit controls the shifting mechanism within the SMG transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the hydraulic unit. This is a complex and expensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **EDC (Electronic Damper Control) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Stiff or bouncy ride, EDC warning light on the dashboard. The EDC system controls the damping characteristics of the shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty shock absorber(s) or addressing wiring/sensor issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per shock absorber, depending on location and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven for a few days. This can be due to a variety of electrical issues, including faulty modules, parasitic drains, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the battery drain. This may involve testing and replacing faulty modules or wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response, and error messages related to the iDrive system.
    *   Solution: Updating the iDrive software, replacing the iDrive controller, or replacing the entire iDrive module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Subframe Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the rear subframe, especially around the mounting points for the differential. This is a more rare issue, but potentially dangerous if left unattended.
    *   Solution: Welding and reinforcing the subframe, or replacing the entire subframe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner material detaches from the backing and begins to sag.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

In summary, the 2006 BMW M5, while offering incredible performance, is prone to several potentially costly issues, particularly related to its S85 V10 engine and the SMG transmission. The rod bearing issue is a significant concern and is one of the most well-known issues for this vehicle. The SMG transmission can be problematic and expensive to maintain. Electrical issues and suspension component failures are also common. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the car thoroughly inspected before purchase and set aside a substantial budget for maintenance and repairs. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate inconveniences to major mechanical failures that can render the car undriveable.
