The 2001 BMW M5 (E39) is a legendary performance sedan known for its blend of luxury, power, and engaging driving dynamics. It came exclusively with a 4.9-liter S62 V8 engine producing 394 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Getrag Type D six-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise the M5 for its exhilarating performance, balanced handling, and timeless design. Common complaints revolve around the high cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as the age-related issues that affect many examples.

**Engine**

**S62 4.9L V8**

*   **VANOS System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VANOS (Variable Nockenwellen Steuerung) system, BMW's variable valve timing system, is prone to failure due to worn seals and solenoid issues. Symptoms include rough idle, loss of power, and a rattling noise from the front of the engine.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding or replacing the VANOS unit, including replacing the seals, solenoids, and potentially the VANOS gears.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rod Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The connecting rod bearings can wear prematurely, leading to engine knocking, especially at low RPMs. This is a common issue that can result in catastrophic engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rod bearings with updated or aftermarket bearings, often including ARP rod bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S62 engine is known for oil leaks from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. These leaks can cause oil consumption and potentially damage other components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Getrag Type D 6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and a worn-out clutch pedal feel. This is a wear item, but can fail prematurely with aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. Consider replacing the flywheel as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly 2nd and 3rd, indicating worn synchronizers.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding the transmission with new synchronizers or replacing the transmission with a rebuilt or new unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Subframe Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks can develop in the rear subframe, particularly around the mounting points for the differential and suspension. This can lead to instability and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Welding reinforcement plates onto the subframe to repair the cracks and prevent further damage or replacing the subframe entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Suspension Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.) can cause clunking noises, vague steering, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings with new or upgraded polyurethane bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on which bushings are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Pixel Loss in Instrument Cluster and Radio Display**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels in the instrument cluster and radio display fade or disappear, making it difficult to read information.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected display screens or sending the cluster/radio for repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows fail to operate or operate slowly and erratically.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop in common areas like the wheel wells, door sills, and around the trunk lid.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the affected panels and applying rust prevention measures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the rust
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dead Pixels on MID (Multi Information Display)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inoperable or hard-to-read MID causing issues with the cars features.
    *   Solution: Replacing the MID module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2001 BMW M5, while a desirable performance sedan, is prone to age-related issues that can be costly to repair. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine (VANOS, rod bearings, oil leaks) and suspension (rear subframe cracking). Electrical issues such as pixel loss are also common. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to maintaining the M5's performance and value. Due to the age of the vehicles, some issues are prevalent across the board. Owners should budget accordingly for preventative maintenance and repairs.
