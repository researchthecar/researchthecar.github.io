The 2003 BMW M5, part of the E39 generation, is a high-performance sedan celebrated for its blend of exhilarating performance and everyday usability. It came exclusively with a 4.9-liter (S62) naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 394 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Getrag Type D six-speed manual transmission. Owners generally love the M5 for its engaging driving experience, powerful engine, and refined interior. Criticisms often revolve around its relatively high running costs, including fuel consumption, maintenance, and repair expenses associated with a performance vehicle of its age.

**Engine**

**S62 4.9L V8**

*   **VANOS Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: VANOS (Variable Valve Timing) system failure can manifest as rough idling, loss of power, and a "check engine" light. Often accompanied by diagnostic trouble codes related to VANOS solenoid performance or camshaft position.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VANOS solenoids, repairing or replacing the VANOS oil pump, or rebuilding the VANOS unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some S62 engines exhibit increased oil consumption as they age, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, particularly on start-up or during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, solutions range from replacing valve stem seals to more extensive engine work, such as piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Guides**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic timing chain guides can become brittle and break over time, leading to a rattling noise from the engine, particularly on start-up. Failure to address this issue can result in severe engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain guides, chain, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, and a high clutch pedal engagement point are common symptoms of a worn clutch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. Replacing the flywheel is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gear Grinding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding noises during gear changes, particularly when shifting into second or third gear, can indicate worn synchronizers.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding or replacing the transmission, including replacing worn synchronizers and bearings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Thrust Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn front thrust arm bushings can cause vibrations in the steering wheel, particularly during braking, as well as reduced steering precision.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front thrust arm bushings or the entire thrust arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Subframe Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Degraded rear subframe bushings can lead to imprecise handling, clunking noises from the rear of the car, and excessive rear-end movement during acceleration and cornering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear subframe bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Pixel Loss on Instrument Cluster**
    *   Description/Symptoms: LCD screens within the instrument cluster (such as the odometer and trip computer) can suffer from pixel loss, making it difficult to read displayed information.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument cluster. Some companies specialize in repairing the LCD screens.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 BMW M5 is a rewarding vehicle to own, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Many of these problems are related to the car's age and the high-performance nature of its components. Engine and transmission issues, particularly those related to the VANOS system and clutch, can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical problems are also common and should be thoroughly inspected before purchase. The severity and cost of these issues can range from minor repairs to major overhauls, so a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW mechanic is highly recommended.
