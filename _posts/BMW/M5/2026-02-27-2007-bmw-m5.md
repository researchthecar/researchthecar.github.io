### Summary Verdict
The 2007 BMW M5 is a performance icon with a powerful V10 engine and engaging SMG transmission. However, its complexity translates to specific reliability concerns, most notably with the S85 engine's rod bearings, VANOS system, and throttle actuators. The SMG transmission can also present issues with its hydraulic pump and clutch actuator. Suspension components, particularly the Adaptive Drive system, are also a potential source of costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive glitches and fuel pump module failures, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, potential buyers must budget for significant maintenance and potential repairs, especially concerning the engine and transmission, to ensure long-term enjoyment of this exceptional but demanding vehicle.
