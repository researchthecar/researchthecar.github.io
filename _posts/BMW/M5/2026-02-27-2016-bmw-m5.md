### Summary Verdict
The 2016 BMW M5 is a formidable performance sedan that, for the most part, offers robust mechanical reliability. The 4.4L twin-turbo V8 engine, while powerful, can be susceptible to issues with wastegate actuators, PCV systems, and ignition coils, particularly as mileage increases. The M-DCT transmission, a complex piece of engineering, has seen reports of mechatronics unit failures and clutch wear, which can be costly to repair. The Adaptive M Suspension's electronic dampers may also require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive system glitches and battery drain, are not uncommon in modern BMWs of this era. However, the exterior and interior components generally hold up well, with no widespread critical failures reported. Owners should be prepared for the potential costs associated with maintaining a high-performance vehicle, especially concerning the engine and transmission.
