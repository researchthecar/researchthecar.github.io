The 2020 BMW M5 is a high-performance sedan boasting a powerful 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 600 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. An even higher performance 'Competition' model increases power to 617 hp. Both versions use an 8-speed automatic transmission (ZF 8HP76). Drivers love the M5 for its incredible acceleration, precise handling, and luxurious interior. Some common complaints include the high price tag, somewhat firm ride quality, and complex infotainment system.

**Engine**

**4.4L Twin-Turbo V8 (S63)**

*   **Oil Leaks from Turbocharger Oil Lines**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are observed around the turbochargers. The oil supply lines to the turbochargers are prone to leaking, especially at the banjo bolt fittings. This can cause a burning oil smell and potentially lead to lower oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger oil lines with updated or improved lines. Tightening the banjo bolts and using new crush washers can sometimes temporarily resolve the issue, but replacement is typically necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ depending on labor and if just the lines are replaced or also other components.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve covers, leading to a burning oil smell. The gaskets become brittle and crack over time due to heat cycling, resulting in oil seeping onto hot engine components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets. This usually involves removing the valve covers and cleaning the mating surfaces before installing new gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks from Expansion Tank**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the expansion tank, leading to low coolant levels. The plastic of the expansion tank can become brittle and crack over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the coolant expansion tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP76)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rough or delayed shifts, especially when the transmission is cold. This can manifest as a hesitation or jerkiness during gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission software update can alleviate the issue. However, in more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission overhaul/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (software update) to $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit controls the transmission's shifting and can develop internal faults. Symptoms include erratic shifting, failure to shift, or transmission entering limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The M5's adaptive dampers, which adjust damping based on driving conditions, can fail. This results in a noticeably harsher ride or uneven handling. Warning lights may appear on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per damper, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor can fail, leading to the vehicle sitting lower than normal or not maintaining proper ride height. Error messages related to the air suspension system will likely appear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can freeze, crash, or exhibit slow response times. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates often resolve these issues. In more severe cases, replacement of the iDrive control unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,500+ (control unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as parking sensors, can fail, leading to inaccurate readings or complete failure of the system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a faulty module not shutting down properly or a parasitic draw.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve replacing a faulty module or repairing wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Trunk/Tailgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic trunk or tailgate may fail to open or close properly, or may make unusual noises. This can be due to faulty actuators, sensors, or hydraulic pumps.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power seats can fail to adjust properly due to faulty actuators. This can affect the seat's position, lumbar support, or headrest.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty seat actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per actuator, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may be jammed, fail to close correctly or cause wind noise due to improper sealing.
    * Solution: Replacement of the sunroof seals, cleaning the sunroof tracks, or repair of the sunroof motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 BMW M5 is a powerful and luxurious sedan but it is not without its issues. Common problems include oil leaks, transmission issues, electrical glitches, and suspension component failures. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, especially those involving the engine, transmission, or adaptive suspension. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
