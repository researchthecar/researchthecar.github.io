**Summary**

The 2017 BMW M5 is a performance-oriented vehicle that offers an exhilarating driving experience. However, it is prone to some common issues, particularly related to the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger problems can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the DCT, especially concerning the mechatronic unit and clutch wear, are also significant concerns. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be expensive to address. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing problems.
