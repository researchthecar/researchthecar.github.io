### Summary Verdict
The 2000 BMW M5 (E39) is a highly desirable performance car, but its advanced engineering for the time means certain components require diligent maintenance and can be costly to repair. The S62 V8 engine's VANOS system and potential for oil consumption are key areas to inspect. Transmission issues, while less common than engine problems, can arise with clutch wear or internal synchronizer wear on the manual gearbox. Suspension components like control arm bushings and subframe mounts are also known wear items that can lead to drivability issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the instrument cluster and ABS/DSC modules, are not uncommon. Despite these potential issues, with proper care and addressing problems promptly, the E39 M5 remains a rewarding and capable vehicle.
