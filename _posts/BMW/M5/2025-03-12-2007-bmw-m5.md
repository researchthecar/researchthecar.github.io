The 2007 BMW M5 is a high-performance sedan that boasts a naturally aspirated 5.0L V10 engine, producing 500 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox) transmission. Owners often praise the M5 for its exhilarating engine performance, precise handling, and luxurious interior. However, some common complaints include high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and the unreliability of certain components, particularly the SMG transmission.

**Engine**

**S85 5.0L V10**

*   **Rod Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive wear on the connecting rod bearings can lead to engine knocking, decreased oil pressure, and ultimately, engine failure. Often caused by insufficient lubrication or wear over time. Symptoms include a metallic knocking sound, especially during cold starts, and low oil pressure warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rod bearings with updated versions and increased oil flow.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+

*   **Throttle Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S85 engine has individual throttle bodies, each controlled by its own actuator. These actuators are known to fail, causing reduced engine power, rough idling, and error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty throttle actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per actuator.

*   **VANOS (Variable Valve Timing) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VANOS system controls the variable valve timing. Problems with this system can cause reduced performance, rough idling, and error codes. Specifically, the VANOS high-pressure oil line is prone to leaking or failing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VANOS oil line or the entire VANOS unit if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various gaskets and seals within the engine can leak oil over time, leading to reduced oil levels and potential engine damage. Common leak points include the valve cover gaskets, oil filter housing gasket, and oil pan gasket.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.

**Transmission**

**7-Speed SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox)**

*   **SMG Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMG transmission relies on a hydraulic pump to operate the clutch and shift gears. The pump can fail due to wear and tear, causing slow or failed shifts, error messages, and eventual inability to drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the SMG pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+

*   **SMG Clutch Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clutch actuator controls the engagement and disengagement of the clutch. Failure can result in jerky shifts, clutch slippage, and difficulty shifting gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

*   **SMG Software Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SMG transmission is controlled by complex software. Bugs or corrupted data can lead to erratic shifting behavior, error codes, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Reflashing the SMG control unit with the latest software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **EDC (Electronic Damper Control) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EDC system controls the stiffness of the dampers. Failure can result in a harsh ride, poor handling, and error messages. Individual dampers or the control module can fail.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty dampers or the EDC control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per damper; $500 - $1,000+ for the control module.

*   **Rear Subframe Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear subframe bushings can wear out over time, leading to excessive movement in the rear suspension. This can cause vague handling, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear subframe bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the complex electronics, the M5 can experience excessive battery drain, especially when the car is parked for extended periods. This can lead to a dead battery and difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the drain and repairing the faulty component. Common culprits include the comfort access system, the iDrive system, and aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the source of the drain.

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system controls various vehicle functions. Malfunctions can include frozen screens, unresponsive buttons, and error messages.
    *   Solution: Resetting the iDrive system, updating the software, or replacing the iDrive control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Symptoms include low voltage, battery not charging, and potential electrical component malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door lock actuators can fail, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per actuator.

**Interior**

*   **Seat Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat motors that adjust the position of the seats can fail, preventing the seats from moving.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty seat motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per motor.

**Summary**
The 2007 BMW M5 is a powerful and enjoyable car, but it can also be expensive to maintain. The most severe issues involve the engine (specifically rod bearing failure) and the SMG transmission, which can lead to significant repair costs. Electrical issues are also common due to the car's complex electronics. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW mechanic is highly recommended.
