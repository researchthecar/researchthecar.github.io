### Summary Verdict
The 2001 BMW M5 (E39) is a highly desirable performance sedan, but its advanced engineering and age mean potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The S62 V8 engine, while powerful, is prone to VANOS system issues and can consume oil. The manual transmission is generally robust, but clutch wear and synchronizer problems can arise. The Adaptive M Suspension's electronic components are a known weak point, often leading to costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and HVAC components, are also common. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and addressing problems proactively, the E39 M5 remains a rewarding classic sports sedan.
