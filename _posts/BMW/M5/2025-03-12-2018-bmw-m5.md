The 2018 BMW M5 (F90) represents a significant leap in performance and technology for the model. It's powered by a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 600 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. This engine is exclusively paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission (ZF 8HP75). What owners generally like about the car is its incredible performance, all-wheel-drive system, luxurious interior, and advanced technology features. Some common dislikes include the firm ride quality, complex iDrive system, and high running costs.

**Engine**

**4.4L Twin-Turbocharged V8 (S63)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, most commonly the valve cover gaskets and the oil filter housing gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets or seals is necessary. Cleaning of the affected area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise, reduced power, or boost pressure, and potential fault codes related to turbocharger performance. These are often found later into the life of the car as the turbos are put under high stress from the high-performance engine.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the exact cause, replacement of faulty turbocharger components, or complete turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP75)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or delayed shifting, particularly during cold starts or under heavy acceleration. This can manifest as clunking noises or a feeling of hesitation when changing gears.
    *   Solution: Software updates for the transmission control unit (TCU) may resolve some shifting issues. In more severe cases, a transmission fluid flush or replacement of valve body components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit controls the transmission's shifting and overall function. Failure can result in a range of issues including error messages, limp mode, and a complete loss of gear selection.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2018 M5 is equipped with adaptive dampers. Failure of these dampers can result in a noticeably degraded ride quality, uneven handling, and error messages related to the suspension system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the faulty damper(s), followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per damper, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system can experience various software glitches, causing the screen to freeze, reboot unexpectedly, or exhibit slow response times.
    *   Solution: Software updates performed by a dealership or qualified technician. In rare cases, hardware replacement of the iDrive module may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $500 for software updates; $1,000+ for hardware replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the car can fail, leading to error messages related to systems such as the parking sensors, tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), or driver assistance features.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor(s), followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, depending on the type and location.

**Summary**

The 2018 BMW M5 is a high-performance machine that demands diligent maintenance. While the common issues aren't necessarily widespread, they can be expensive to address due to the complexity of the vehicle's systems and the specialized parts required. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger issues can be costly, but potentially mitigated with regular maintenance and proper care. Transmission issues, adaptive damper problems, and electrical glitches can also contribute to significant repair bills. It is recommended that potential buyers get a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified BMW technician to identify any existing or potential problems.
