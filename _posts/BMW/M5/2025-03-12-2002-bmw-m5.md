The 2002 BMW M5 (E39 chassis) is a high-performance sedan known for its blend of luxury and sporty driving dynamics. It came equipped with a single engine and transmission option: a 4.9-liter (S62) V8 engine producing 394 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a Getrag Type D six-speed manual transmission. People admire the car for its responsive engine, engaging handling, and timeless design. Common complaints include the cost of maintenance, the age-related issues of a 20+ year old car, and the relatively high fuel consumption compared to modern vehicles.
