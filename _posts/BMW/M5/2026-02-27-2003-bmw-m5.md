### Summary Verdict
The 2003 BMW M5 (E39) is a highly desirable performance sedan, but its complexity and age mean certain issues are common. The S62 V8 engine is a powerhouse but is prone to expensive rod bearing failures and VANOS system problems, requiring diligent maintenance and potentially significant repair costs. The manual transmission is generally robust, though clutch wear and internal component issues can arise. Suspension components, particularly bushings, are common wear items that can affect handling. Electrical gremlins, such as ABS/DSC module failures and instrument cluster issues, are also frequently reported. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, some specific components like headliners and LCD displays can degrade over time. Owners should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair expenses, especially concerning the engine and electronics.
