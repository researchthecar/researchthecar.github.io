# 2017 BMW 440i xDrive

### Overview
The 2017 BMW 440i xDrive, equipped with the B58 3.0L turbocharged inline-six engine and an 8-speed Steptronic automatic transmission, is generally considered a reliable performance coupe. This model year benefits from BMW's mature engineering, particularly with the B58 engine, which replaced the N55 and addressed some of its predecessor's known issues.
