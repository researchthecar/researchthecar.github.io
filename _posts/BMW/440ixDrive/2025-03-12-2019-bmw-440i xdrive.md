The 2019 BMW 440i xDrive is a stylish and sporty coupe, gran coupe, or convertible known for its engaging driving dynamics and luxurious features. The 440i xDrive comes standard with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine (B58) producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2019 4 Series include the 430i which has a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (B48) producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either an 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners appreciate the 440i's powerful engine, precise handling, and upscale interior, but some dislike its relatively high price and sometimes-stiff ride, depending on the suspension configuration.
