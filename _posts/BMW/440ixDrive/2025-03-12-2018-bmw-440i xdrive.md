The 2018 BMW 440i xDrive is a popular luxury coupe/Gran Coupe known for its blend of performance and style. It's powered primarily by a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine (B58) producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Other available engines in the 4 Series lineup include the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four (B48) in the 430i models. The 440i comes standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission; a 6-speed manual was also offered, but is less common. Owners often praise the 440i's powerful engine, balanced handling, and luxurious interior, however, some dislike the relatively high maintenance costs, and some report issues with the infotainment system and electronic components.
