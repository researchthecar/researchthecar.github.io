The 2020 BMW 440i xDrive is a popular luxury coupe, gran coupe, and convertible known for its blend of performance and style. The xDrive variant signifies it's equipped with BMW's all-wheel-drive system. The heart of the 440i xDrive is a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 4 Series include the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four in the 430i models. Transmission options are primarily an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 440i xDrive for its strong acceleration, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior. Common criticisms include a somewhat numb steering feel compared to older BMWs, and the cost of maintenance.
