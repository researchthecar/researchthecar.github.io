The 2019 BMW 230i is a sporty and agile coupe, favored for its engaging driving dynamics and premium feel. It typically comes equipped with a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 engine, producing 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with either an 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual. Some people appreciate the nimble handling and refined interior, while others might find the rear seats cramped or the ride a bit firm. Alternative engine options include the more powerful B58 turbocharged inline-6, designated for the M240i. Common complaints include the run-flat tires contributing to a harsh ride and some infotainment system quirks.
