The 2021 BMW 230i is a sporty and stylish coupe, praised for its engaging driving dynamics, comfortable interior, and attractive styling. It appeals to drivers seeking a premium small car experience with a focus on performance. However, some owners have reported experiencing certain issues with their vehicles. The 2021 230i came standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. An optional engine available was a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 cylinder engine, found in the M240i, which produces 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space and a relatively firm ride.
