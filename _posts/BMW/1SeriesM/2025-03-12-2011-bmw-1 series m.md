The 2011 BMW 1 Series M is a high-performance coupe celebrated for its raw driving experience and engaging dynamics. It boasts a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine producing 335 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque (369 lb-ft with overboost). Unlike other 1 Series models, the 1 Series M was only available with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise the car's sharp handling, powerful engine, and relatively compact size. Common complaints revolve around the firm ride, especially on rough roads, and the limited availability of the car as it was a one-year-only model. The 1 Series M also has poor fuel economy for its class.

**Summary**

The 2011 BMW 1 Series M, while a highly desirable sports car, is not without its potential issues. The engine is prone to common N54 problems such as HPFP failure, wastegate rattle, and oil leaks. The manual transmission can experience clutch issues, and suspension bushings are known to wear prematurely. Most of the issues are well-documented, and preventative maintenance can help mitigate some of the risks. Repairs can range from relatively inexpensive (gasket replacements) to quite costly (turbocharger replacement). Buyers should be aware of these potential expenses when considering a 1 Series M.
