The 2024 BMW 760i xDrive represents the pinnacle of BMW's luxury sedan lineup. Boasting a potent 4.4-liter TwinPower Turbo V8 engine paired with a 48V mild-hybrid system, it delivers 536 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 3.0-liter inline-six with a 48V mild-hybrid system in the 740i, and an all-electric powertrain in the i7 models. All configurations utilize an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 760i xDrive for its opulent interior, smooth ride quality, and cutting-edge technology. However, some criticisms include the bold (and sometimes polarizing) exterior styling, the complexity of the iDrive infotainment system, and the high cost of ownership.
