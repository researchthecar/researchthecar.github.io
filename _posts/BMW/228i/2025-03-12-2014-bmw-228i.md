The 2014 BMW 228i is a compact coupe known for its sporty handling, engaging driving experience, and relatively fuel-efficient engines. The base engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, producing 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some owners praise its nimble handling and responsive engine, while others find the ride a bit harsh and the interior somewhat basic compared to other luxury cars. The lack of standard features and potential for expensive repairs are also common concerns.

**Summary**

The 2014 BMW 228i, while praised for its driving dynamics, can present some reliability concerns. The most significant issues seem to revolve around the N20 engine's timing chain and potential oil leaks. Transmission issues with the 8-speed automatic can also be problematic. Suspension damper failures and electrical gremlins add to the potential ownership costs. Depending on the specific issue and the need for parts, costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major repairs like engine or transmission work. While some issues are more prevalent than others, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchase decision.
