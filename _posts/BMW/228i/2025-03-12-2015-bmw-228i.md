The 2015 BMW 228i is a sporty and compact coupe or convertible, praised for its nimble handling, responsive steering, and relatively fuel-efficient engine. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (N20), producing 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Some owners dislike the firm ride, especially with the sport suspension option, and the relatively small rear seats. A more powerful M235i version was also available. The 228i could be had with either an 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (N20)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, and the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine or garage floor, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal is the usual fix. For more serious leaks, the entire oil filter housing or oil pan may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the source and complexity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The N20 engine is known for potential timing chain failures. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and potential engine misfires. If the timing chain breaks, it can cause catastrophic engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioner is necessary. In cases where the engine has suffered damage due to timing chain failure, a complete engine rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP45)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or delayed shifts, particularly when cold, or hesitation when accelerating. This can be due to worn valve body components or degraded transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and replacement may alleviate the issue in some cases. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Cracked Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or cracking of the front lower control arm bushings. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps, and vague steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, leading to a dead battery, especially if the car sits for an extended period.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw. This could involve testing various electrical components and modules to isolate the faulty one. Sometimes a faulty comfort access module is the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the window regulators failing. Symptoms include a popping sound, window being stuck, or erratic movement.
    * Solution: Replace the window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 BMW 228i, while a fun-to-drive car, has some potential issues to watch out for. The engine is prone to oil leaks and timing chain problems, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the 8-speed automatic are also possible. Electrical problems and suspension component wear are less severe but should be considered. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
