Engine oil and coolant leaks, timing chain issues (particularly in the N20 engine), automatic transmission problems, and electrical issues can be costly to repair. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconvenience to major engine repairs. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic specializing in BMWs. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive repairs, others, such as timing chain or transmission problems, can lead to significant repair bills.
