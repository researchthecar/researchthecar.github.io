The 2012 BMW 535i GT (Gran Turismo) is a unique blend of sedan, wagon, and crossover, offering a spacious interior and a higher seating position compared to a traditional sedan. The 535i GT model comes equipped with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine (N55 engine) producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2012 5 Series GT include a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 in the 550i GT. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the 535i GT for its luxurious ride, ample rear legroom, and hatchback practicality. However, some dislike its unconventional styling and the higher maintenance costs associated with BMW vehicles.
