### Summary Verdict
The 2015 BMW 535i GT demonstrates a solid reliability record, particularly concerning its powertrain. The 3.0L turbocharged inline-six engine and the 8-speed automatic transmission are generally robust. However, potential owners should be aware of specific issues like wastegate rattle on the turbocharger, PCV valve failures, and electric water pump issues, which are not uncommon for this engine variant as it ages. The suspension, while advanced, can sometimes experience leaks in the active roll stabilization system. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive infotainment system and keyless entry sensors, can also arise. Interior components like power seat actuators are also noted for occasional failures. Overall, while not immune to problems, the 535i GT offers good reliability for a luxury performance vehicle, provided maintenance is kept up and potential issues are addressed promptly.
