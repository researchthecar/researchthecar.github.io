### Summary Verdict
The 2010 BMW 535i GT (F07) is a capable luxury vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of specific common issues. The 3.0L twin-turbo engine, while powerful, is prone to problems with its turbochargers, fuel injectors, and high-pressure fuel pump, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission can also develop issues with its mechatronic unit and torque converter.
