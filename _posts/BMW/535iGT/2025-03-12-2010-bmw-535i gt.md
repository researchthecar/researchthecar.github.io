The 2010 BMW 535i GT (Gran Turismo) is a unique vehicle blending sedan, wagon, and SUV characteristics. The 535i GT was available with either a 3.0L Turbo Inline-6 (N54) or a 4.4L Twin Turbo V8 (N63). For the 2010 model year, both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0L Turbo Inline-6 produced 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the 535i GT for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and luxurious features. Common complaints include the complex iDrive system, the divisive styling, and the potential for expensive repairs due to the vehicle's advanced technology and BMW's generally high maintenance costs.

**Summary**

The 2010 BMW 535i GT, while offering a luxurious and spacious experience, can be prone to several issues, especially as it ages.

Electrical gremlins with the iDrive system and comfort access can also be frustrating. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major component replacements. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW mechanic to identify any potential problems.
