The 2013 BMW 535i Gran Turismo (GT) offers a unique blend of sedan comfort and hatchback versatility, making it a compelling choice for those seeking practicality with a touch of luxury. It came with two engine options: a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (N55) and a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (N63). The 535i GT with the N55 engine produces 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. All models came standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GT's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and refined driving experience. However, potential downsides include its polarizing styling, larger size making it less agile than a traditional sedan, and higher maintenance costs associated with BMW ownership.
