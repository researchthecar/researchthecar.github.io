The 2020 BMW M550i xDrive is a performance-oriented sedan that bridges the gap between the standard 5 Series and the full-fledged M5. It comes equipped with a potent 4.4-liter TwinPower Turbo V8 engine, generating 523 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered through an 8-speed automatic transmission with xDrive all-wheel drive. Owners generally praise the M550i for its blend of luxury, performance, and comfortable daily drivability. Some criticisms revolve around its cost, some of the optional technology features can be complex, and the car's weight can be felt in tighter corners compared to lighter sports sedans. The only engine option for the 2020 M550i is the 4.4L V8, and the only transmission option is the 8-speed automatic.
