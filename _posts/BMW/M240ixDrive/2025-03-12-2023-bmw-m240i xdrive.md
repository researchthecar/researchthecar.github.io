The 2023 BMW M240i xDrive is a performance-oriented coupe that blends luxury with sporty handling. It comes standard with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine producing 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. It's praised for its powerful engine, sharp handling, and luxurious interior, but some owners have noted a firm ride and the lack of a manual transmission option. Some common dislikes include the heavy reliance on electronic controls and the somewhat polarizing exterior design. The M240i xDrive is only available in one configuration, so there is no need to call out the different configurations.
