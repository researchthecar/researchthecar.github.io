The 2017 BMW M240i xDrive is a performance-oriented coupe known for its agile handling, potent engine, and relatively comfortable ride. It's powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine producing 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2017 2-series included the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 in the 230i. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic. Owners generally praise the M240i's performance, responsive handling, and relatively compact size. Criticisms often revolve around the firm ride (especially on rough roads), somewhat cramped rear seats, and some interior material quality.
