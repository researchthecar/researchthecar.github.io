The 2008 BMW X6 marked BMW's entry into the "Sports Activity Coupe" segment, blending the style of a coupe with the utility of an SUV. The X6 offered a unique driving experience that some owners appreciated for its sporty handling and bold design. Others found its compromised rear headroom and cargo space less practical than traditional SUVs. The 2008 X6 was available with two engine options: a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 generating 400 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Common complaints regarding the vehicle include issues with the electronic systems, oil leaks, and suspension components.
