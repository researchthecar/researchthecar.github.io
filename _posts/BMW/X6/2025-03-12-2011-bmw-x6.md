The 2011 BMW X6 is a unique vehicle, a blend of SUV practicality and coupe-like styling. It offered several engine choices: a 3.0-liter inline-6 turbo (N55) producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 (N63) producing 400 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque, and a high-performance 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 (S63) in the X6 M producing 547 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, later upgraded to an 8-speed automatic transmission for the N55 engine in the xDrive35i models. Owners often praise the X6's powerful engines, luxurious interior, and distinctive design. However, common complaints include high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and a polarizing appearance.
