### Summary Verdict
The 2008 BMW X6, particularly with its V8 engines, can be a rewarding vehicle to own but requires attention to potential reliability concerns. The most common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, including turbocharger problems and valve stem seal leaks on the N63 engine, and coolant leaks on the N62. Transmission issues, such as mechatronic unit failures, are also noted. The advanced suspension systems, while enhancing performance, can also be a source of costly repairs if components like the Active Roll Stabilization or air suspension fail. Electrical gremlins, especially with the iDrive system and parasitic battery drain, are also possibilities. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential problems and ensuring the longevity of the X6.
