### Summary Verdict
The 2009 BMW X6, particularly models equipped with the twin-turbocharged engines (N63 and N54), can be prone to specific, albeit often costly, reliability concerns. Common issues revolve around the high-pressure fuel system, turbochargers, and valve stem seals, especially in the V8 variants. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can also arise, particularly with the mechatronic sleeve. Electrical gremlins, such as iDrive system glitches and battery drain, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age. While the suspension and interior components generally hold up well, specific failures like air suspension compressors can occur. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections, especially for higher-mileage examples.
