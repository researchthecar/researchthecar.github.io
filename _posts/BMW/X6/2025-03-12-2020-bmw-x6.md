The 2020 BMW X6 is a stylish and sporty mid-size luxury SUV coupe, known for its sloping roofline and powerful engine options. Engine choices include a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six (xDrive40i) producing 335 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (M50i and X6 M) with varying outputs depending on the trim. All engine options are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the X6's striking design, powerful engine performance, and luxurious interior. However, some common criticisms include the compromised rear headroom due to the coupe-like roof, the higher price compared to more traditionally shaped SUVs, and potential reliability concerns that can be associated with BMW vehicles.
