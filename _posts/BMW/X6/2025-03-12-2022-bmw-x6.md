**Summary**

The 2022 BMW X6, while a desirable luxury vehicle, is not without its potential issues. Engine-related problems, particularly oil and coolant leaks, appear to be the most concerning due to their potential severity and cost of repair, especially with the V8 engine. Transmission issues, while present, are less frequent but can still be costly. Electrical glitches and sensor failures are common in modern vehicles and the X6 is no exception. Suspension issues are most prevalent on vehicles equipped with air suspension, adding another layer of potential maintenance. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, including budgeting for potential repairs. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others can quickly escalate into multi-thousand-dollar expenses.
