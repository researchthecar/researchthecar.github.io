## 2009 BMW X6

The 2009 BMW X6 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV with coupe-like styling. It was offered with three engine options: a 3.0-liter inline-six, a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8, and a 4.4-liter twin-turbo diesel V8. The 3.0-liter inline-six produced 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, while the 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 produced 400 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque.
