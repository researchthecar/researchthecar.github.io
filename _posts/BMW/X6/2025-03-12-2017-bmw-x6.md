The 2017 BMW X6 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV that combines the styling of a coupe with the practicality of an SUV. It was available with a few engine options: a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque), and a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 (445 hp and 480 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the X6's sporty handling, powerful engine options, and luxurious interior. However, some dislike the compromised rear headroom and cargo space due to its sloping roofline, as well as the higher price compared to more traditional SUVs.

**Summary**

The 2017 BMW X6 has potential issues across various systems, ranging from common oil leaks to more complex electrical and suspension problems.  The V8 engine option appears to have more potentially costly issues than the inline-6.  While many issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive repairs, some, like turbocharger or air suspension replacements, can be significantly more expensive. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic familiar with BMWs.
