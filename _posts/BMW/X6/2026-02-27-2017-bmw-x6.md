### Summary Verdict
The 2017 BMW X6 demonstrates a generally good reliability record, particularly for its powertrain components when properly maintained. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the turbocharger systems on the xDrive35i, ignition coils and fuel injectors on the xDrive50i, and potential leaks or mechatronic unit problems with the automatic transmission. Electrical gremlins, especially with the iDrive system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Suspension components, particularly air suspension if equipped, can require attention. Overall, while not immune to problems, the X6 offers a robust platform, with most issues being repairable, though costs can be significant due to the premium nature of the vehicle.
