The 2014 BMW X6 is a mid-size luxury crossover known for its distinctive coupe-like styling and sporty driving dynamics. Engine options include the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque) and the 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (445 hp and 480 lb-ft of torque) in the xDrive50i trim. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The X6 is often praised for its powerful engines, agile handling, and luxurious interior. However, some common complaints include limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline, reduced cargo space compared to more traditionally shaped SUVs, and higher maintenance costs associated with BMW vehicles.
