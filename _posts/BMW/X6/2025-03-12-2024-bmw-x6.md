The 2024 BMW X6 is a luxury coupe SUV that blends sporty styling with practicality. Engine options include a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 producing 375 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque (X6 xDrive40i), and a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 producing 523 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque (X6 M60i). All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the X6 for its powerful engines, luxurious interior, and distinctive design. Common complaints often involve the compromised rear visibility due to the sloping roofline, the higher price compared to more traditional SUVs, and the firm ride quality, especially with larger wheel options.

**Summary**

The 2024 BMW X6 generally exhibits a mix of minor and potentially more significant issues. Electrical glitches in the infotainment system are relatively common but often addressable through software updates. The V8 engine might face oil leak issues over time, while the 8-speed transmission can exhibit shifting problems. Air suspension, if equipped, can also be problematic. The cost of repairs ranges from no cost (software updates) to thousands of dollars for major component replacements, but the issues are not necessarily widespread and don't represent a major reliability concern for most owners.
