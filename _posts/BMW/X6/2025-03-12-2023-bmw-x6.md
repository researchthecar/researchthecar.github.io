*   **Oil Leaks from Oil Filter Housing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are observed around the oil filter housing gasket. The leak can be minor initially, but worsens over time, leading to oil consumption and potential damage to other engine components. Visible oil stains on the engine block are a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing gasket is required. In some cases, the entire oil filter housing assembly may need to be replaced if warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are commonly reported, stemming from the expansion tank, radiator hoses, and various connections. The smell of coolant, visible puddles under the vehicle, and low coolant level warnings are typical indicators.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak. Replace the faulty hose, expansion tank, or connection. Pressure test the cooling system to confirm the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the source and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found
