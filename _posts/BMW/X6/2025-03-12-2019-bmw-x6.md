Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 BMW X6, categorized by major components.

The 2019 BMW X6 is a mid-size luxury SUV coupe that offers a blend of sporty handling and upscale features. Several engine options were available, including a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine (335 hp, 330 lb-ft of torque) in the sDrive40i and xDrive40i models, and a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine (456 hp, 479 lb-ft of torque) in the xDrive50i model. All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.
