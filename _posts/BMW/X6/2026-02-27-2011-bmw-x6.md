### Summary Verdict
The 2011 BMW X6, particularly the V8 models, can be prone to more significant repair costs related to its turbocharged engines and complex systems like the Adaptive Drive. Issues with turbochargers, fuel injectors, and cooling systems are not uncommon for the xDrive50i. The transmission, while generally robust, can experience leaks or torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, especially with the iDrive system and parasitic battery drain, also appear in owner reports. While the 35i is generally considered more reliable than the 50i, it's not immune to turbocharger or PCV valve issues. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance and repair expenses compared to less performance-oriented SUVs, especially as the vehicle ages. Regular and thorough maintenance is crucial to mitigate some of these potential problems.
