**Summary**

The 2022 BMW X7, while a luxurious and capable SUV, has several potential issues that owners should be aware of. Engine oil leaks and cooling system issues are common concerns, particularly on the V8 models, which can become expensive to repair. The air suspension can also present problems, leading to ride quality issues and repair costs. Electrical glitches within the iDrive system and sensor malfunctions can also be problematic.
