The 2019 BMW X7 marked BMW's entry into the full-size luxury SUV segment. The X7 aimed to combine luxury, space, and BMW's signature driving dynamics. Engine options for the 2019 X7 included the xDrive40i with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 producing 335 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, and the xDrive50i featuring a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 generating 456 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Common praises for the X7 often revolve around its spacious and luxurious interior, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. Some common complaints include the large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and the high price point.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6 (xDrive40i)**

*   **Oil Filter Housing/Cooler Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant and/or oil leaks from the oil filter housing. This can lead to low coolant/oil levels, overheating, and potential engine damage if left unattended. Visible coolant or oil pooling under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing gasket and/or the oil cooler. Often, the entire oil filter housing assembly is replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

**4.4L Twin-Turbocharged V8 (xDrive50i)**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can stem from various locations, including coolant hoses, the water pump, or the turbocharger coolant lines. Low coolant levels, overheating, and visible leaks are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coolant hose, water pump, or turbocharger coolant line is usually the remedy. A pressure test can help pinpoint the leak's origin.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the location and complexity)

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can experience leaks in the air struts, compressor failure, or issues with the height sensors. This can result in uneven ride height, a harsh ride, or the vehicle failing to maintain its set height.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air strut(s), air compressor, or height sensor(s) is typically required. Diagnosing the exact source of the leak is crucial.
