The 2016 BMW M235i is a performance-oriented coupe and convertible that delivers a thrilling driving experience. Powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine (N55), it produces 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. It comes available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners frequently praise the M235i for its responsive handling, potent engine, and relatively compact size, making it a fun daily driver or weekend track car. Common complaints center around a firm ride, limited rear seat space (especially in the coupe), and potential maintenance costs associated with a performance BMW.

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW M235i is a generally reliable performance car, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine issues like oil leaks, VANOS solenoid failures, and charge pipe cracks are common. Transmission issues depend on the chosen transmission, but the automatic transmission can suffer from mechatronic sleeve leaks. Suspension components may wear over time. While some issues can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, especially those involving the transmission or more complex engine repairs, can be costly. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify potential problems before buying.
