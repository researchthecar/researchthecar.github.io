The 2015 BMW M235i is a performance-oriented coupe or convertible praised for its engaging driving dynamics, strong performance, and relatively compact size. The main engine option is the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 N55 engine, producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options were not available for this specific model. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. Owners typically appreciate the car's balance of power and handling, its comfortable interior (especially the sport seats), and its relatively understated styling. Common dislikes include the firm ride (especially on rough roads), some cheap-feeling interior plastics, and the cost of maintenance and repairs, especially outside of the factory warranty period.
