The 2022 BMW 128ti is a front-wheel-drive performance hatchback, powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 265 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. It's only available with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often praise the 128ti for its sharp handling, responsive engine, and engaging driving experience. Common criticisms often center around the relatively firm ride quality and the fact that it lacks all-wheel drive, which is standard on some of its competitors. While other 1 Series models exist, the 128ti is the main performance variant. No other engines or transmissions are offered on the 2022 128ti.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

* **Coolant Loss**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant level drops rapidly, requiring frequent refills. Can lead to overheating if not monitored. May notice a sweet smell around the engine bay or coolant puddles under the vehicle. A burning coolant smell can also be an indicator.
    * Solution: Inspect the coolant system for leaks, including hoses, the radiator, water pump, and expansion tank. Pressure test the system to identify the leak. Replace any faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+, depending on the source and severity of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leak around the valve cover, leading to a burning oil smell, especially after the engine has been run for a while. Oil can drip onto the exhaust manifold, causing smoke. Can also lead to low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket. Ensure the mating surfaces are clean and properly torqued during installation.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hesitation or clunking during gear changes, particularly at lower speeds. Can sometimes be accompanied by a "Service Engine Soon" light.
    * Solution: First, check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change might resolve the issue if the fluid is dirty or low. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be inspected and potentially rebuilt or replaced. In some cases, a software update can also address shifting issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change $150 - $300. Valve body repair/replacement $800 - $2000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or spontaneously reboots.
    * Solution: Try performing a system reset. If the problem continues, a software update may be needed. In some cases, the control unit itself may require replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update $0 - $200 (if not covered under warranty). Control unit replacement $500 - $1500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors intermittently fail, providing false warnings or no warnings at all.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is malfunctioning. Check the wiring and connections. Replace the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    * Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or buzzing sounds emanating from the dashboard or trim panels, especially when driving on uneven surfaces.
    * Solution: Identify the source of the rattle. This may involve disassembling parts of the dashboard or trim to locate the loose component. Apply felt tape or other sound-deadening material to secure the component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+, depending on the complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 BMW 128ti, while praised for its performance, can suffer from a few common issues. Coolant leaks and valve cover gasket leaks can occur in the engine, while the transmission can exhibit rough shifting.
