The 2024 BMW 128ti is a performance-oriented hatchback, offering a sporty driving experience with front-wheel drive. It features a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 265 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While lauded for its sharp handling, responsive engine, and engaging driving dynamics, some drivers find the ride a bit harsh and the front-wheel-drive configuration less engaging than rear-wheel-drive BMWs. Others dislike the lack of manual transmission option.
