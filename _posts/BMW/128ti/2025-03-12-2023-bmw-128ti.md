The 2023 BMW 128ti is a sporty, front-wheel-drive hot hatch known for its engaging driving dynamics and distinctive styling. It's powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 261 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. There are no other engine or transmission options available for this specific model. Owners often praise the 128ti for its sharp handling, responsive engine, and comfortable interior, while common criticisms include its front-wheel-drive configuration (compared to BMW's traditional rear-wheel-drive setup) and the somewhat firm ride quality.
