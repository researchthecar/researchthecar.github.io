**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor (Hybrid System)**

*   **High Voltage Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced electric-only driving range, decreased overall fuel economy, and error messages related to battery performance. The battery might not hold a charge as long as it initially did.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-voltage battery pack is the typical solution. In some cases, individual battery modules can be replaced if diagnostics indicate a localized issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000 - $15,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hybrid System Malfunction Warning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle displays a "Hybrid System Malfunction" warning light, potentially accompanied by reduced power, limited driving modes, or complete immobilization. Error codes relating to the electric motor, power electronics, or battery management system are often stored.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with BMW-specific diagnostic tools is crucial to pinpoint the root cause. Repairs might involve replacing faulty sensors, wiring harnesses, power inverters, or even the electric motor itself. Software updates can sometimes resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+, depending on the component requiring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of coolant, requiring frequent top-ups. Visible coolant leaks near the engine, particularly around the water pump, thermostat housing, or coolant hoses. Overheating can occur if the leak is severe.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty water pump, thermostat housing, or coolant hoses. Pressure testing the cooling system can help identify the source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+, depending on the part needing replacement and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve cover, leading to a burning oil smell. Visible oil residue on the engine block.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky gear changes, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement might alleviate the issue if it's due to contaminated fluid. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $5,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs higher than normal without a corresponding increase in speed. The transmission may struggle to engage gears, or slip out of gear entirely.
    *   Solution: Inspect the transmission fluid for contamination or low levels. If the fluid is in good condition, internal transmission damage is likely, requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, compressor failing to inflate, suspension light illuminated, ride is bumpy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of failed air struts, air compressor, or related air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ depending on what suspension part failed and needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes intermittently. Navigation, audio, and other functions might be affected.
    *   Solution: Attempting a system reset or software update is the first step. If the issue persists, the iDrive control unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $1,500+ (control unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alerts or failure of parking sensors, blind spot monitoring system, or other driver-assist features. Error messages appear on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing the faulty sensor(s). Recalibrating the system after sensor replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, plus labor and calibration costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tail Light Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sections of the LED tail light assembly fail, leading to reduced visibility and potential safety concerns.
