### Summary Verdict
The 2004 BMW 320i (E46) offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury for its era. While its core mechanicals are generally robust, common issues tend to revolve around the cooling system (water pump, hoses, radiator), the VANOS system on the inline-six engines, and certain electrical components like the ABS/DSC module and window regulators. Transmission reliability is decent for both manual and automatic options, though fluid leaks and torque converter issues can occur on automatics.
