The 2003 BMW 320i is a compact executive car that offers a blend of sporty handling and luxurious features. The most common engine option for this model is the 2.2L Inline-6, which produces around 170 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available, depending on the market, could have included smaller displacement inline 4-cylinder or inline 6-cylinder engines. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the car's precise steering and well-balanced chassis. However, common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly with the cooling system and electrical components, as well as the high cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**2.2L Inline-6 (M54B22)**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, often manifesting from the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, and the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    * Solution: Replace the affected gasket(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ depending on the location of the leak and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Cooling System Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating is a frequent issue. The water pump impeller (especially if it's the original plastic one), thermostat, radiator, and expansion tank are prone to failure. Symptoms include the temperature gauge rising, coolant leaks, and steam coming from the engine bay.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty component(s) with updated versions (metal impeller water pump, etc.).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the failed component and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **VANOS Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The VANOS (Variable Valve Timing) system can experience issues, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and poor fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replacing the VANOS seals, cleaning the VANOS solenoids, or replacing the VANOS unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the specific issue and repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (GM A5S390R/ZF 5HP19)**

* **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, and failure to engage gears are all potential problems. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid level.
    * Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid, valve body repair/replacement, or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement) depending on the severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Front control arm bushings wear out, causing a clunking noise when going over bumps, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace the control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side, depending on whether just the bushings or the entire arm is replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Broken Coil Springs**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coil springs, especially the rear springs, are prone to breaking. This results in a noticeable sag in the suspension and a clunking noise.
    * Solution: Replace the broken coil spring(s). Replacing both springs on the same axle is recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per spring, including labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 BMW 320i, while offering a desirable driving experience, is prone to several reliability issues. Engine issues like oil leaks and cooling system failures are common and can lead to expensive repairs. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic variant, can also be costly. Suspension and electrical problems contribute further to the ownership expenses. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive DIY repairs, others require professional attention, potentially resulting in significant costs.
