The 2005 BMW 320i is part of the E46 generation, known for its blend of sporty handling and driver-focused design. The 320i was generally appreciated for its responsive steering, balanced chassis, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes included relatively high maintenance costs compared to other brands and the potential for age-related issues typical of European cars. The 320i was available with a 2.2L Inline-6 engine producing around 170 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options in the E46 range included the 325i/330i with a larger 2.5L and 3.0L Inline-6 respectively. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**2.2L Inline-6 (M54B22)**

*   **VANOS Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: VANOS (variable valve timing) system can experience issues due to worn seals. This leads to rough idling, loss of power (particularly at lower RPMs), and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the VANOS seals, often with aftermarket kits designed for improved durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common oil leaks occur from the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, and oil pan gasket. These leaks can cause oil consumption, burning oil smells, and visible oil spots.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per gasket
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic components in the cooling system (radiator, expansion tank, hoses, water pump) can become brittle and crack over time. This leads to coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the failing components, often with updated or higher-quality aftermarket parts. A complete cooling system overhaul is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (GM A5S325Z or ZF 5HP19)**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic transmission can develop slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifting, or a complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Fluid change, valve body repair, or transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual (Getrag S5D 250 G)**
*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front control arm bushings (especially the front bushings) wear out, causing vibrations at higher speeds, clunking noises, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the control arm bushings or the entire control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Subframe Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Deteriorated rear subframe bushings can cause clunking noises, imprecise handling, and vibrations. In extreme cases, this can lead to cracks in the subframe itself.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear subframe bushings. Inspect and repair any subframe cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The window regulators can fail, causing the windows to become inoperable or to fall down into the door.
    *   Solution: Replace the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixel Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels in the instrument cluster (especially the digital display) can fade or disappear, making it difficult to read information.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can form in wheel wells, rocker panels, trunk lid, and door bottoms. This is more common in areas with salt and snow.
    *   Solution: Cut out and weld in new metal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner material can detach from the backing board, causing it to sag.
    *   Solution: Replace the headliner material.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 BMW 320i (E46) is generally a well-regarded car, but owners should be aware of common issues that arise with age and mileage. Engine issues like VANOS failure and oil leaks are common, as are cooling system problems due to aging plastic components. Suspension issues such as control arm bushing failures and rear subframe bushing deterioration can affect handling and ride quality. Electrical problems, particularly with window regulators and instrument cluster pixel loss, are also relatively frequent. Rust may be an issue, depending on the climate the vehicle has been in, and the interior can suffer from headliner sagging. While individual repair costs may vary, many of these issues can be addressed for a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, making preventative maintenance and careful inspection essential for prospective buyers.
