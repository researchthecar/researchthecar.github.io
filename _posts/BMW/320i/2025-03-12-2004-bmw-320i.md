Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2004 BMW 320i, formatted for your website.

The 2004 BMW 320i is part of the E46 generation. While offering a blend of sporty handling and premium features, it also has a reputation for some common problems as it ages. The 320i was equipped with a 2.2L inline-six cylinder engine producing approximately 170 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available in the E46 range, depending on the market, included smaller displacement inline-four and six-cylinder engines, as well as larger, more powerful options like the 3.0L inline-six in the 330i. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. People generally like the E46's balanced driving dynamics, classic BMW styling, and relatively compact size. Dislikes often center around the higher maintenance costs associated with owning a BMW and the age-related issues that surface on older models.

**Summary**

The 2004 BMW 320i, while enjoyable to drive, is prone to several common issues due to its age and the inherent design of certain components. Engine oil leaks and cooling system failures are particularly prevalent and can lead to significant repair costs if not addressed promptly. Electrical problems, especially with window regulators and instrument cluster pixels, are also common. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or extensive rust repair, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision and budget for ongoing maintenance.
