The 2012 BMW 320i, part of the F30 generation, offered a blend of sporty handling and luxury features. The 320i was the entry-level model, powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine (N20), producing 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available in the 2012 F30 3-Series lineup included more powerful versions of the 2.0-liter turbo-4 (in the 328i) and a 3.0-liter inline-6 (in the 335i). Transmission options for the 320i included a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the 320i's fuel efficiency, responsive handling, and comfortable interior, but common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the engine and electrical systems, as well as the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Summary**

The 2012 BMW 320i presents a mixed bag for potential owners. While it offers an engaging driving experience and a refined interior, it's prone to certain reliability issues, particularly concerning the N20 engine. The timing chain problem is a significant concern due to the potential for severe engine damage. Oil leaks, while generally less catastrophic, are common and require attention. Electrical gremlins and suspension component wear can also contribute to higher ownership costs. Repair costs can be substantial, especially for engine-related issues. Therefore, prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified BMW mechanic.
