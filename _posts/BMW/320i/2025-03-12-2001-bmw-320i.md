The 2001 BMW 320i is part of the E46 generation, known for its blend of sporty handling, driver-focused interior, and classic BMW styling. The 320i came equipped with a 2.2-liter inline-6 cylinder engine producing approximately 170 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options in the E46 range include the 2.5-liter inline-6 (325i) and the 3.0-liter inline-6 (330i), offering more power. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the 320i's balanced handling and engaging driving experience. However, common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs, particularly concerning the cooling system and various sensors. The car's age also contributes to issues with brittle plastic parts and general wear and tear.

**Engine**

**2.2L Inline-6 (M54B22)**

* **VANOS Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, rough idle, and potential stalling. Often triggered by failing VANOS seals (Viton seals recommended) or a clogged VANOS solenoid.
    * Solution: Replacing the VANOS seals or cleaning/replacing the VANOS solenoid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on DIY or professional repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Cooling System Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks. Common culprits are a failing water pump (often with a plastic impeller), brittle radiator hoses, a cracked expansion tank, and a leaking thermostat housing.
    * Solution: Replacing the water pump (metal impeller recommended), radiator hoses, expansion tank, and thermostat housing. Consider replacing the entire cooling system as preventative maintenance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on parts replaced and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket & Oil Filter Housing Gasket)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, low oil level. These gaskets tend to harden and crack over time.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve cover gasket and/or oil filter housing gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ depending on which gasket(s) are replaced and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, loss of low-end torque, and potential check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the DISA valve with an updated or reinforced unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, unusual noises when engaging or disengaging the clutch.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Shift Linkage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sloppy or vague shifting feel, difficulty finding gears.
    * Solution: Replacing worn shift linkage bushings and potentially the shift lever.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the parts replaced and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (GM or ZF)**
* **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement, slipping between gears, harsh or jerky shifts. Often caused by low fluid level, contaminated fluid, or internal wear.
    * Solution: Start by checking and replacing the transmission fluid and filter. If the problem persists, internal repairs or a transmission replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid/filter change) - $2000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Control Arm Bushings Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, vague steering, uneven tire wear.
