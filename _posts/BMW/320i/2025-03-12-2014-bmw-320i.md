The 2014 BMW 320i is an entry-level luxury sedan offering a blend of sporty handling and fuel efficiency. The 320i features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2014 BMW 3 Series lineup include a 240-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo-4 in the 328i, a 300-horsepower 3.0-liter inline-6 in the 335i, and a diesel engine in the 328d. Transmission options are either an 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual, but the 320i only came with the 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 320i for its responsive steering, comfortable ride, and premium interior. However, some criticisms include the relatively high cost of ownership, smaller back seat, and occasional reliability concerns.
