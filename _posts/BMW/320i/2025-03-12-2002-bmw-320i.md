The 2002 BMW 320i is part of the E46 generation of the 3 Series, known for its blend of sporty handling and comfortable ride. In the North American market, the 320i was powered by a 2.2-liter inline-6 engine producing 170 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. This engine was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the 320i for its engaging driving dynamics, precise steering, and well-balanced chassis. However, common complaints often revolve around the car's age-related maintenance needs, including cooling system issues, electrical gremlins, and suspension wear. The relatively lower power output compared to other 3 Series models can also be a point of dissatisfaction for some.

Electrical problems such as window regulator and ABS module failures can add to the maintenance burden. Interior issues like pixel loss and sagging headliners are mostly cosmetic but can detract from the overall driving experience. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly based on the condition of the car and the availability of parts. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect the car's maintenance history and be prepared for potential repairs.
