The 2024 BMW 320i is an entry-level luxury sedan known for its blend of sporty handling, comfortable interior, and fuel efficiency. It's powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 181 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2024 3 Series include a more powerful version of the 2.0-liter turbo-4 in the 330i (255 hp), and a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 in the M340i (382 hp). All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 320i for its engaging driving dynamics and premium feel, but some criticize its relatively small rear seats and the cost of optional features.
