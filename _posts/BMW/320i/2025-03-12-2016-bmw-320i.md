The 2016 BMW 320i is an entry-level luxury sedan that offers a blend of performance, fuel efficiency, and BMW's signature driving experience. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available in the 2016 3 Series lineup (but not the 320i) include a more powerful 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder (328i/330i), a 3.0-liter turbo six-cylinder (340i), and a diesel engine (328d). Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 320i for its nimble handling, comfortable ride, and stylish interior, while some common dislikes revolve around the base engine's lack of power compared to higher trim levels, and the cost of maintenance.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (N20)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks commonly occur from the valve cover gasket and the oil filter housing gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket and/or the oil filter housing gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Although more prevalent in earlier N20 engines, some 2016 models can experience premature timing chain wear or failure. Symptoms include a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, chain guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (GA8HP45Z)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or delayed shifts, particularly when cold, or hesitation when accelerating. This can sometimes be attributed to the transmission fluid degrading over time.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for fluid flush; $1500 - $3000+ for valve body work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Cracked or Broken Rear Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports exist of rear coil springs cracking or breaking, especially in areas with harsh winter conditions and road salt. Symptoms include a clunking noise from the rear suspension, uneven ride height, or instability while driving.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear coil springs. It's recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Blower Motor Resistor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor resistor controls the fan speed for the heating and air conditioning system. A faulty resistor can cause the fan to only work on certain settings or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported unexplained battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including a faulty alternator, parasitic draw from an electrical component, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the battery drain, which may involve replacing the battery, alternator, or identifying and fixing the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent freezing, lagging, or unexpected reboots of the iDrive infotainment system.
    * Solution: Software updates, replacement of the iDrive computer.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+ depending on severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW 320i, while generally reliable, can experience issues related to its engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. The most common and potentially costly issues revolve around oil leaks and timing chain problems on the engine. Suspension issues, such as broken rear coil springs, are also notable. While some electrical issues like the blower motor resistor are relatively inexpensive to fix, battery drain issues can be more complex and costly to diagnose. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of maintenance and potential repairs when considering a 2016 BMW 320i.
