The 2013 BMW 320i is an entry-level luxury sedan offering a blend of sporty handling and fuel efficiency. Its most common engine is the 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder, producing 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options in the 3 Series range for that year included the 328i's more powerful 2.0L turbo (240 hp), and the 335i's 3.0L turbocharged inline-six (300 hp). All 320i models came standard with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 320i for its precise steering, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. Common complaints include relatively high maintenance costs compared to non-luxury brands and occasional issues with certain electronic components and the engine's oil consumption.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (N20)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes, requiring frequent top-offs. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored closely. Blue smoke from the exhaust can be another indicator.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the valve stem seals or piston rings can resolve the issue. A leakdown test can help determine the extent of the wear. BMW issued a service bulletin for this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain guide can wear prematurely, leading to a stretched timing chain. Symptoms include a rattling noise, particularly on cold starts. If left unaddressed, the timing chain can break, causing significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioner. It's also recommended to inspect the sprockets for wear and replace them if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   No Issues Found

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift. These issues can stem from worn or malfunctioning solenoids within the valve body.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body or rebuilding the transmission. Sometimes, a fluid flush and software update can temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but the problem often returns.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Cracked Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced steering precision and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings. It's often recommended to replace the entire control arm assembly as the bushings are difficult to press in/out.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Comfort Access System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The keyless entry and start system malfunctions. Doors may not unlock or lock properly, and the car may not start even with the key fob inside. This is often caused by a failing door handle sensor or a faulty CAS (Car Access System) module.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component causing the issue (door handle sensor, CAS module, etc.) and replace it. Reprogramming may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*    **Rear Tail Light Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of rear taillight(s) to function. This can be caused by a faulty bulb connector, or a wiring harness issue that can be caused by vibration and heat.
    *   Solution: Replacing bulb connector or repairing the wiring harness
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctions, including getting stuck, making unusual noises, or failing to open or close completely. The track mechanism can become misaligned or damaged.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair the sunroof track, replace damaged components, and lubricate the mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticking iDrive Controller**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive controller knob becomes sticky or difficult to rotate smoothly. This is often caused by debris or spilled liquids getting into the mechanism.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the iDrive controller mechanism, or replacing it if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 BMW 320i, while praised for its driving dynamics and fuel efficiency, has some known issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption and timing chain issues in the 2.0L turbo engine. While these issues don't affect every car, they can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the 8-speed automatic, and electrical glitches can also add to the ownership costs. Overall, pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended, and prospective owners should factor in the potential for higher maintenance costs compared to more mainstream vehicles.
