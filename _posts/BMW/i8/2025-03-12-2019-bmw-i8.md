The 2019 BMW i8 is a plug-in hybrid sports car known for its futuristic design, impressive performance, and efficient hybrid powertrain. It features a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor. The combined output is 369 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. The i8 is lauded for its eye-catching styling, nimble handling, and decent fuel economy for a sports car. Common criticisms include limited cargo space, a somewhat cramped interior, and a polarizing engine note (often artificially enhanced through the audio system).
