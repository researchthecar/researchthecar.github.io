**Introduction**

The 2014 BMW i8 is a plug-in hybrid sports car that combines a 1.5-liter turbocharged 3-cylinder engine with an electric motor to produce a combined output of 357 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The electric motor is powered by a 7.1-kWh lithium-ion battery pack, which provides an electric-only range of up to 22 miles.

The i8 is known for its sleek design, advanced technology, and impressive performance. However, like any other vehicle, it has its share of issues.

**Engine**

**1.5-liter turbocharged 3-cylinder engine**

* **Timing chain rattle:** The timing chain can develop a rattling noise when the engine is cold. This is caused by a faulty tensioner spring.
* **Fuel injector failure:** The fuel injectors can fail, causing the engine to run poorly or misfire.
* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail, resulting in a loss of power.

**Transmission**

**6-speed automatic transmission**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip when shifting gears. This is caused by a worn clutch.
* **Shifting problems:** The transmission may have difficulty shifting gears or may get stuck in a gear. This is caused by a faulty shift solenoid.
* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter may shudder when the vehicle is accelerating. This is caused by a worn torque converter.
