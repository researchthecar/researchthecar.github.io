Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2016 BMW i8, formatted for your website.

The 2016 BMW i8 is a plug-in hybrid sports car boasting a striking design and impressive performance. It combines a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 357 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. The engine powers the rear wheels, while the electric motor drives the front wheels, creating an all-wheel-drive system. Owners often praise its futuristic styling, fuel efficiency for a sports car, and unique driving experience. Criticisms generally focus on limited cargo space, a firm ride, and higher repair costs compared to conventional vehicles. The i8 came with only one engine and transmission option during this model year, and there are no alternate engine or transmission options.

**Electric Motor**

* **High Voltage Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gradual decrease in battery capacity leading to reduced electric-only range and overall performance. The car might display error messages related to the hybrid system or battery.
    * Solution: Battery replacement or individual module replacement (if possible).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000 - $20,000+ (depending on the extent of the degradation and whether the entire battery pack or just modules are replaced).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Electric Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Complete failure of the electric motor, resulting in a loss of front-wheel drive and potential immobility. Error messages related to the electric drive system will be present.
    * Solution: Replacement of the electric motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $12,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged 3-Cylinder**

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points within the cooling system, including hoses, the water pump, and the cylinder head. Symptoms include a low coolant warning light, visible coolant leaks under the vehicle, and potential overheating.
    * Solution: Identify and replace the leaking component (hose, water pump, head gasket).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the source of the leak).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or crankshaft seals. You may notice oil spots under the car or a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin 6-Speed Automatic (Specifically for the electric motor)**

* **Transmission Failure (Electric Motor)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Complete failure of the electric motor transaxle, resulting in a loss of front-wheel drive and potential immobility. Error messages related to the electric drive system will be present.
    * Solution: Replacement of the transmission assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Aisin 6-Speed Automatic (Specifically for the 1.5L engine)**

* **Transmission Failure (1.5L Engine)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Complete failure of the gasoline engine transaxle, resulting in a loss of rear-wheel drive and potential immobility. Error messages related to the engine drive system will be present.
    * Solution: Replacement of the transmission assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Adaptive Damper Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The i8 is equipped with adaptive dampers that adjust damping based on road conditions and driving style. These dampers can fail, leading to a harsh ride, poor handling, and error messages related to the suspension system.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty adaptive damper.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per damper (including labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Charging System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Problems with the charging system, including failure to charge, slow charging speeds, or error messages related to the charging process. This can be due to issues with the charging port, onboard charger, or charging cable.
    * Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty component (charging port, charger, or cable).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the component).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: The i8 relies on numerous sensors for various functions. Sensor failures, such as those related to the hybrid system, brakes, or driver-assistance features, can trigger warning lights and affect vehicle performance.
    * Solution: Identify and replace the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the sensor).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Automatic Trunk Lid Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The hydraulic struts that hold the trunk lid open can fail, causing the trunk to not stay open on its own.
    * Solution: Replace the struts.
