The 2002 BMW 745i marked a significant departure from its predecessors with its controversial styling and advanced technology. The primary engine option was the 4.4L N62B44 V8 engine producing 325 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. While some appreciated the car's innovative features like iDrive and its luxurious interior, others criticized its complex electronics, polarizing design, and potential for expensive repairs. Common complaints included electrical gremlins, suspension issues, and engine oil leaks. A strong selling point for this car was its luxury features and powerful engine. A sore point was the high cost of maintenance and repairs, along with the complexity of the vehicle.
