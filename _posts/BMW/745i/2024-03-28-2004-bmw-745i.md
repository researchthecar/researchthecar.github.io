The 745i is known for its refined performance, luxurious interior, and advanced technology. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of reported issues.

**Engine**

**N62 4.4L V8**

* **Valvetronic system failure:** The Valvetronic system, which controls the variable valve timing, can fail, causing decreased engine performance and fuel efficiency. Solution: Replace the Valvetronic motor or solenoid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **VANOS issues:** The VANOS system, which controls the variable valve timing, can experience issues, leading to reduced engine power and increased fuel consumption. Solution: Replace the VANOS solenoids or control unit. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Transmission**

**6-speed automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may experience slipping, causing gear changes to be rough or delayed. Solution: Replace or rebuild the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
* **Mechatronic sleeve problems:** The Mechatronic sleeve, which connects the transmission to the engine, can develop a leak, causing transmission fluid loss and potential damage. Solution: Replace the Mechatronic sleeve. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,000+

**Suspension**

* **Air suspension leaks:** The air suspension system can develop leaks, causing the vehicle to ride lower than normal. Solution: Replace the air bags or compressor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
* **Control arm bushings wear:** The control arm bushings can wear out prematurely, leading to excessive play and reduced handling stability. Solution: Replace the control arm bushings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** The battery may experience a parasitic drain, which can cause the vehicle to fail to start. Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the drain, such as faulty modules or wiring. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
* **DSC system failure:** The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) system may malfunction, disabling traction and stability control. Solution: Replace the DSC control unit or sensors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Exterior**

* **Door handle issues:** The door handles can become loose or inoperable. Solution: Replace the door handles. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Headlight condensation:** The headlights may experience condensation, leading to blurred vision at night. Solution: Replace the headlight lens or gaskets. Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+

**Interior**

* **Dashboard pixel failure:** The dashboard pixels may become distorted or fail, impairing visibility of instrument cluster information. Solution: Replace the dashboard. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Climate control failure:** The climate control system may fail to regulate temperature or airflow. Solution: Repair or replace the climate control unit or sensors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Summary**

The 2004 BMW 745i is a well-rounded luxury sedan, but it is not without its potential issues. While some problems, such as battery drain or pixel failure, are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others, like transmission slipping or Valvetronic failure, can be more severe and costly to repair. Overall, it is important to weigh the known issues against the vehicle's strengths and determine if it meets your individual needs and budget.
