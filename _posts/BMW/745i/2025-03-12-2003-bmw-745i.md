The 2003 BMW 745i marked a significant shift in BMW's design language and technology. Powered by the N62B44 4.4L V8 engine, it produced 325 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. The 745i was praised for its smooth ride, luxurious interior, and advanced features like iDrive. However, it also faced criticism for its complex electronics and sometimes controversial styling. People liked the comfort, performance, and prestige associated with owning a BMW flagship sedan. Dislikes often centered around the high maintenance costs, electrical gremlins, and the steep learning curve associated with the iDrive system. The 745i only had one engine option, but the 745Li had an extended wheelbase.
