**Engine**

**4.4L Twin-Turbo V8 (N63TU)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often stemming from valve cover gaskets, oil filter housing gasket, or the turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or lines. Ensure proper torque specifications are followed during reassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on the source and labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from various points, including the water pump, radiator hoses, and expansion tank. Overheating is a potential symptom.
    *   Solution: Pressure test the cooling system to identify the leak source. Replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+ (depending on the source and labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VANOS Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Variable Valve Timing (VANOS) solenoid failures can lead to rough idling, reduced power, and engine hesitation. Diagnostic codes will usually point to the specific solenoid(s) affected.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty VANOS solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the turbos, loss of power, check engine light. The Alpina B7's turbos operate at higher boost levels, potentially shortening their lifespan compared to standard BMW models.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger(s). This is a labor-intensive job.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 8HP Automatic Transmission**

*   **Mechatronic Sleeve Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Leak between the mechatronic unit and transmission housing. Will usually occur after higher mileage.
    * Solution: Replace the mechatronic sleeve and fluid
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, especially between certain gears. Can be caused by low fluid level, valve body issues, or software problems.
    *   Solution: Check and correct the transmission fluid level. If that doesn't resolve the issue, a transmission service (fluid and filter change) may be necessary. In some cases, valve body replacement or mechatronic unit reprogramming might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Alpina B7 features an air suspension system. Common issues include air leaks from the air springs (bags), compressor failure, or ride height sensor malfunctions. Symptoms include uneven ride height, a noisy compressor, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air spring(s), compressor, or faulty ride height sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Adaptive Damper Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The B7 uses electronically adjustable dampers. These can fail, resulting in a rough ride, poor handling, and diagnostic error codes.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**
