The 2007 BMW Alpina B7 is a high-performance luxury sedan based on the BMW 7 Series (E65/E66). It featured a supercharged 4.4-liter V8 engine producing 500 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. It only came with a specially tuned 6-speed automatic transmission manufactured by ZF. Owners appreciate the B7's blend of performance, luxury, and exclusivity. Common dislikes involve the higher maintenance costs associated with its unique and performance-oriented components compared to a standard 7 Series. Finding parts can sometimes be challenging, and repairs tend to be more expensive due to the Alpina-specific engineering.
