The 2020 BMW Alpina B7 is a high-performance luxury sedan based on the BMW 7 Series. It features a handcrafted interior, bespoke exterior styling, and a significantly upgraded powertrain compared to the standard 7 Series. For 2020, the Alpina B7 came with one engine and transmission option: a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 600 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners praise the Alpina B7 for its exceptional blend of luxury, performance, and exclusivity. Common criticisms include the high price tag, potential for expensive maintenance, and the somewhat understated exterior styling for a vehicle with such capabilities.
