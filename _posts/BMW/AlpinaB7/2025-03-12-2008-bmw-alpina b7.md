The 2008 BMW Alpina B7 is a high-performance luxury sedan based on the BMW 7 Series (E65/E66). The Alpina B7 distinguishes itself with unique styling, a handcrafted interior, and a specially tuned engine. The sole engine option available was a supercharged 4.4-liter V8 producing 500 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. It was paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
