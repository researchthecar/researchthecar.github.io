The 2021 BMW iX3 is a fully electric SUV that marked BMW's entry into the mainstream electric vehicle market. It features a single electric motor driving the rear wheels, producing 286 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. It was not offered with any other engine or transmission options, as it's a pure electric vehicle. Owners often praise the iX3 for its comfortable ride, refined interior, and the seamless integration of BMW's technology. Criticisms often revolve around the vehicle's conservative styling compared to some other EVs and its slightly lower range compared to newer electric SUVs.
