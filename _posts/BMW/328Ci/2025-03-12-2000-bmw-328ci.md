**Summary**

The 2000 BMW 328Ci, while a desirable car, is prone to several age-related issues. Engine issues like VANOS failure and cooling system leaks can be relatively costly. Suspension problems, particularly rear subframe mount failures, can be significant and expensive to repair. Electrical issues such as window regulator and pixel loss are common nuisances. Rust, if left unchecked, can become a major concern. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the car for these issues and factor in potential repair costs. While these issues can be costly, many owners find the driving experience and styling of the 328Ci worthwhile.
