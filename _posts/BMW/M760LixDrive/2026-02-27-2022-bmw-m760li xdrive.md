# 2022 BMW M760Li xDrive

### Overview
The 2022 BMW M760Li xDrive represents the pinnacle of BMW's luxury sedan offerings, combining potent performance with opulent comfort. As a high-performance variant of the 7 Series, it is equipped with a powerful V12 engine and advanced xDrive all-wheel-drive system. Reliability data for such a specialized and low-volume vehicle is less extensive than for mainstream models. However, based on available owner feedback and technical assessments, the M760Li generally exhibits strong build quality, though its complexity can lead to specific, albeit infrequent, concerns, particularly related to its advanced powertrain and electronics. Owners should expect a premium ownership experience with maintenance costs commensurate with its luxury and performance status.
