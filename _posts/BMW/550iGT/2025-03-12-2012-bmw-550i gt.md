*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal is the typical fix. Retorquing the bolts can sometimes fix minor leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
