### Summary Verdict
The 2010 BMW 550i GT, while offering a compelling blend of performance and luxury, is a vehicle that demands diligent maintenance and can incur significant repair costs, particularly concerning its potent V8 engine and advanced technological features. The N63 engine is known for issues like excessive oil consumption and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to address. Transmission reliability is generally good with the ZF automatic, but mechatronic unit and torque converter issues can arise. The sophisticated suspension systems, especially those with active components, are prone to leaks and failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system and parasitic battery drain, are also reported. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair expenses, and a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
