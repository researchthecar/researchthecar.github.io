The 2015 BMW 550i GT is a luxury hatchback known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine options. This model year offered two engine choices: a 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 producing 315 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.4L twin-turbocharged V8 producing 445 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the 550i GT's unique blend of practicality and performance, citing its comfortable seating, ample cargo space, and spirited acceleration. Common criticisms include its polarizing exterior styling, complex electronics, and potentially high maintenance costs.
