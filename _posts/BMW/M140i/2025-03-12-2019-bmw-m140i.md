The 2019 BMW M140i is a popular hatchback known for its performance and practicality. It's powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine producing 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. It was typically offered with either an 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission, although the manual was phased out during this production run. People generally appreciate the M140i for its powerful engine, sporty handling, and relatively compact size, making it fun to drive in various conditions. Common dislikes include the firm ride (especially on rough roads), the sometimes-dated interior features, and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-Six (B58)**

*   **Oil Leaks from the Oil Filter Housing/Cooler**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often originating from the oil filter housing or the integrated oil cooler. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, low oil levels, and the smell of burning oil.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing gasket and/or the oil cooler. Ensure proper torqueing of the new housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points in the cooling system, including the water pump, radiator hoses, and expansion tank. Signs include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles under the car. The plastic coolant pipes can become brittle over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking component(s). The water pump should be inspected and potentially replaced as preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during low-speed maneuvers. Also sometimes experiences gear engagement hesitation. This can be caused by worn transmission fluid or software issues.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush can sometimes alleviate the issue. A software update from BMW may also be necessary. If the problems persist, valve body issues may be present.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush $300-$500, Valve body repair $1500-$2500+
*   **Mechatronic unit failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission malfunctions, difficulty shifting, and limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Cracking/Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and cracking of the front and rear control arm bushings, particularly on cars driven on rough roads or in harsh climates. Symptoms include clunking noises over bumps, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per axle)

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain, especially if the car sits for extended periods. Can be caused by various electrical components not shutting down completely.
    * Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to isolate the offending circuit. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

*   **Faulty Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The B58 engine relies on a number of sensors to function properly, and some owners have reported issues with sensors failing prematurely. Examples include mass airflow sensors, oxygen sensors, and crankshaft position sensors. Symptoms can include poor engine performance, error codes, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per sensor)

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **iDrive Screen Delamination/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive screen can suffer from delamination (separation of layers) or complete failure, especially on cars exposed to high temperatures. This can cause visual distortions or make the system completely unusable.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the iDrive screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters in some M140i models have been known to fail.
    *   Solution: Replacing the seat heater element.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per seat)

**Summary**

The 2019 BMW M140i offers exhilarating performance, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine oil and coolant leaks are prevalent concerns, and suspension components may require attention due to wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly battery drain and sensor failures, can also occur. Interior issues primarily involve the iDrive screen and seat heaters. The severity of these problems ranges from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs, so thorough inspection and maintenance are crucial. Overall, the 2019 M140i is a fun car but requires attention to its common faults to maintain reliability.
