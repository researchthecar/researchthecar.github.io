**Summary**

The 2020 BMW 740i xDrive offers a luxurious driving experience, but like many high-end vehicles, it can be prone to certain issues. The most common problems reported involve engine oil leaks, transmission shifting issues, air suspension failures, electrical glitches, and interior component malfunctions. While some issues can be resolved with relatively inexpensive fixes like software updates or gasket replacements, others, such as air suspension or iDrive module failures, can be quite costly.
