The 2024 BMW M340i is a performance-oriented variant of the popular 3 Series sedan. It's praised for its blend of power, agility, and daily usability. The M340i is equipped with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six cylinder engine, producing 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The M340i comes standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the car's performance and handling, some common complaints include the run-flat tires providing a harsher ride, the increasing complexity of the infotainment system, and the cost of maintenance and repairs. Some might find the styling too similar to the standard 3 Series.
