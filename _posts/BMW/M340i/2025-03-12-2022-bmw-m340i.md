The 2022 BMW M340i is a popular luxury sports sedan known for its blend of performance and practicality. It's powered by a potent 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine, producing 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. While this is the primary engine option for the M340i, it is also available with xDrive, BMW's all-wheel-drive system. The sole transmission option is an 8-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the M340i for its quick acceleration, comfortable ride, and well-appointed interior. However, some common criticisms include the lack of driver engagement compared to older BMWs, and occasional reliability concerns.
