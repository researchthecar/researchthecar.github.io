The 2016 BMW 420i Gran Coupe is a stylish and practical four-door coupe that offers a blend of sporty driving dynamics and everyday usability. The 420i variant is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, producing around 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2016 4 Series Gran Coupe included the 428i (later 430i) with a more powerful version of the 2.0-liter, and the 435i (later 440i) featuring a 3.0-liter inline-six. Both rear-wheel drive (RWD) and all-wheel drive (xDrive) configurations were offered. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the car's sleek design, comfortable interior, and responsive handling. Common dislikes include the relatively small rear seat space and the potential for costly maintenance associated with BMW vehicles.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (N20/B48)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks often originate from the valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket, or the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the source of the leak and labor rates).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues (N20 Engine)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Primarily affects the N20 engine produced up until 2015, but some 2016 models may still have the N20. The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to a loose timing chain. This can cause rattling noises, especially upon startup, and can potentially lead to severe engine damage if the chain breaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioner, and guides. It's recommended to replace all related components to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or a hesitation when accelerating.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In other cases, valve body replacement or mechatronic unit repair might be necessary.  Performing regular transmission fluid changes per the manufacturer's recommended intervals (or even more frequently) may help mitigate this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (for software update) - $3,000+ (for valve body/mechatronic unit repair or replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Cracked Suspension Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Suspension springs may crack or break over time, especially in areas with harsh winters or poor road conditions. Symptoms include a clunking or rattling noise from the suspension, uneven tire wear, and a noticeable sag in the ride height.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected suspension springs. It's generally recommended to replace springs in pairs (both front or both rear) to maintain balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ (depending on labor and parts).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent glitches, screen freezes, or complete system failures of the iDrive infotainment system.
    *   Solution: First, try a system reboot. Software updates can also address many iDrive issues. In severe cases, the iDrive control unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for reboot) - $150 (for software update at a dealer) - $800+ (for control unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery loses charge quickly, especially when the car is left parked for extended periods. This can be due to a faulty battery, a parasitic drain from an electrical component, or a malfunctioning alternator.
    * Solution: Have the battery tested and replaced if necessary. If the battery is good, diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic drain.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (for battery replacement), $100 - $500+ (for diagnosing and repairing parasitic drain).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Adaptive Headlight Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Adaptive headlights may fail to adjust properly, resulting in poor visibility. Error messages may appear on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the headlight control module or replace the faulty headlight unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the component and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may get stuck, make excessive noise, or leak water. This can be caused by worn tracks, faulty motors, or clogged drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Clean and lubricate the sunroof tracks and check the drain tubes for clogs. Replace the sunroof motor or other faulty components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the complexity of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 BMW 420i Gran Coupe, while generally a reliable vehicle, can be prone to some common issues. Engine oil leaks and transmission issues can be costly to address. The timing chain issue on the N20 engine needs to be addressed. The electrical issues with the iDrive system and battery drain can be frustrating.
