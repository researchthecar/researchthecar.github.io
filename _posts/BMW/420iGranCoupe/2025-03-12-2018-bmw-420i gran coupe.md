The 2018 BMW 420i Gran Coupe is a stylish and practical four-door coupe that blends sporty handling with everyday usability. The model we'll focus on is equipped with the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, producing 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2018 4 Series Gran Coupe include the more powerful 430i with a 248hp 2.0L turbo 4 cylinder and the 440i with a 320hp 3.0L turbo inline-6. All engines were offered with either an 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual (though the manual is far less common). Drivers often praise the 420i Gran Coupe for its sleek design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving dynamics, but some find the rear passenger space limited and the base engine slightly underpowered.
