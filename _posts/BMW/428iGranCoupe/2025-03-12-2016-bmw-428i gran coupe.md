The 2016 BMW 428i Gran Coupe is a stylish four-door coupe that offers a blend of sporty handling and everyday practicality. The base engine for this model is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (B48) producing 240 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque. Other available engines for the 4 Series Gran Coupe included the 435i with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six. Both engines were offered with either an 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission, although the 428i was more commonly equipped with the automatic. Owners generally praise the 428i Gran Coupe for its sleek design, agile handling, and comfortable interior. However, some common complaints include reliability issues, particularly with the cooling system and certain electrical components, as well as the relatively firm ride.
