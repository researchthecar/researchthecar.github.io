The 2015 BMW 428i Gran Coupe is a four-door coupe that blends sporty styling with practicality. The most common engine option is the 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder, producing 240 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include the 435i's 3.0L turbocharged inline-six, boasting 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, though a 6-speed manual was offered on some models. Owners often praise the 428i Gran Coupe for its sleek design, agile handling, and comfortable ride. Common complaints center around the cost of maintenance, occasional electrical glitches, and the relatively small rear seats.

**Summary**

The 2015 BMW 428i Gran Coupe presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine oil leaks and timing chain problems with the N20 are significant concerns, potentially leading to costly repairs. The N55 engine has fewer major issues but still requires attention to common oil leaks and VANOS solenoids. Transmission problems, electrical glitches, and suspension wear are also common. Overall, while the 428i Gran Coupe offers a desirable blend of style and performance, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in maintenance costs when making their decision. The severity of the issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. Pre-purchase inspections and thorough maintenance records are highly recommended.
