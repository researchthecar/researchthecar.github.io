The 2015 BMW 550i GT xDrive is a luxury hatchback offering a blend of practicality and performance. The 550i GT xDrive is equipped with a 4.4-liter TwinPower Turbo V8 engine producing 445 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often appreciate the spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. However, some common complaints include high maintenance costs, complex electronics that can be prone to issues, and the polarizing exterior styling.

**Engine**

**4.4L TwinPower Turbo V8 (N63TU)**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common from various locations including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals.  Address turbocharger oil lines as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the location and extent of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from the coolant transfer pipe (the "valley pan" that sits under the intake manifold), coolant hoses, and the water pump.  Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty coolant components.  The valley pan repair is labor intensive due to its location.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+, depending on the specific leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: While less common than earlier versions of the N63, the N63TU can still experience timing chain wear and potential failure. Symptoms can include rattling noises, especially on startup, and potentially engine misfires or failure to start.
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report rough shifting, hesitation between gears, or a noticeable "clunk" when shifting, especially at lower speeds.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change using the correct fluid specification (ZF Lifeguard 8). If the problem persists, valve body replacement or mechatronic unit repair might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 (fluid and filter change), $1500 - $4000+ (valve body/mechatronic unit).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Issues (Rear)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear air suspension can experience issues with the air springs leaking, the compressor failing, or the air lines leaking. Symptoms include the rear of the car sagging, the suspension taking a long time to level after starting the car, or an "Air Suspension Fault" warning light.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking air springs, the faulty compressor, or the leaking air lines.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per air spring, $800 - $1500+ for the compressor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **iDrive Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system can sometimes freeze, glitch, or fail to respond to inputs.  Software updates may resolve some issues, but hardware failures can occur.
    * Solution: Try a system reset. Update the iDrive software. If the problem persists, the iDrive controller or head unit may need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (software update/diagnosis), $500 - $2000+ (component replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur due to a faulty module not properly "sleeping" or parasitic drain from aftermarket accessories. Symptoms include a dead battery, especially after the car has been sitting for a few days.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the battery drain.  This may involve testing individual modules to identify the culprit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (diagnosis), $200 - $1000+ (repair depending on the component).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Panoramic Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The panoramic sunroof can experience issues with the motor failing, the tracks becoming misaligned, or the seals leaking. Symptoms include the sunroof not opening or closing properly, excessive wind noise, or water leaks.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the sunroof motor, realign the tracks, or replace the seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Summary:**

The 2015 BMW 550i GT xDrive offers a compelling combination of luxury and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine oil and coolant leaks are frequent and can be costly to repair. Air suspension problems are also relatively common. While some of the electrical issues can be resolved with software updates, others may require expensive component replacements. Overall, maintenance and repair costs for this model can be higher than average, and prospective buyers should factor this into their ownership expectations.
