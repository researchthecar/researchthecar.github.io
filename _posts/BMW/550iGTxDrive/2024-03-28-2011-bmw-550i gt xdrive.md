**Engine**

* **N63 4.4L V8**
    * **Valve Stem Seal Failure:** Leaking seals cause excessive oil consumption and smoke from the exhaust.
    * **Timing Chain Rattle:** Worn timing chains can rattle or skip, potentially causing catastrophic engine damage.
    * **Fuel Injector Failure:** Faulty injectors can result in engine misfires, rough running, and poor fuel economy.

**Transmission**

    * **Torque Converter Shudder:** The torque converter can develop a shudder when shifting gears.
    * **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** The mechatronic unit, which controls the transmission's operation, can fail, leading to erratic shifting or loss of power.
    * **Transmission Fluid Leak:** Leaks can develop from the transmission pan or other seals, causing fluid loss and potential damage.

**Suspension**

* **Front Control Arm Bushing Wear:** Worn bushings can cause clunking noises and affect handling.
* **Rear Suspension Sagging:** The rear suspension can sag over time, leading to uneven tire wear and reduced handling stability.
* **Adaptive Suspension Malfunction:** The adaptive suspension system may malfunction, causing the ride height to fluctuate or the shocks to become overly stiff or soft.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Parasitic drain on the battery can lead to premature discharge.
* **Xenon Headlamp Ballast Failure:** Faulty ballasts can cause the xenon headlights to flicker or fail.
* **Navigation System Malfunction:** The navigation system may freeze or display incorrect information.

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Drain Tube Clogging:** Clogged drain tubes can cause water to leak into the cabin.
* **Tailgate Latch Failure:** The tailgate latch may fail, preventing the tailgate from closing properly.
* **Rubber Trim Deterioration:** Rubber trim around the windows and doors can deteriorate over time.

**Interior**

* **Panorama Sunroof Noise:** The panoramic sunroof can generate excessive wind noise at highway speeds.
* **iDrive System Lag:** The iDrive infotainment system may experience lag or responsiveness issues.
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may fail to regulate temperature effectively.

**Recalls**
