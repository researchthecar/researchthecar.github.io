The 2017 BMW 550i GT xDrive is a luxury hatchback known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. The 550i GT came standard with a 4.4-liter TwinPower Turbo V8 engine, producing 445 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. It came standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission. What people generally like about this vehicle is its blend of luxury, performance, and practicality. The hatchback design allows for a large cargo area, making it more versatile than a traditional sedan. The powerful V8 engine provides quick acceleration and a smooth driving experience. However, some common dislikes include its polarizing styling, relatively high maintenance costs, and the complexity of its electronics.

**Engine**

**4.4L TwinPower Turbo V8 (N63)**

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Stem Seals)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur due to degrading valve stem seals. This can manifest as excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, especially upon starting the engine after it has been sitting, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve stem seals requires removing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks (Coolant Transfer Pipe)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The coolant transfer pipe, located in the engine's "V", can leak as the seals degrade from heat and age. This may cause a burning coolant smell, low coolant levels, and potential overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the coolant transfer pipe requires significant engine disassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turbocharger failure can occur, presenting symptoms such as a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine (whining or screeching), and potentially an engine malfunction warning light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected turbocharger(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (depending on whether one or both turbos need replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit controls the shifting of the transmission. Failure can result in harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the mechatronic unit, which may also involve flashing the transmission control unit (TCU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibration at certain speeds, shuddering during acceleration, or a complete loss of drive can be symptoms of torque converter failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear air suspension can develop leaks in the air springs or malfunctions in the air compressor, resulting in the vehicle sitting unevenly (usually sagging in the rear), a rough ride, and error messages related to the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air spring(s) and/or the air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ (depending on which components need replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The iDrive infotainment system can experience glitches, freezes, or complete failure, affecting navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the iDrive module, or repair of faulty wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity of the issue and the required repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car's battery can drain quickly, especially when the vehicle is not used regularly. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from various electronic modules.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic drain, which may involve updating software, replacing a faulty module, or repairing wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity of the drain)

**Summary**

The 2017 BMW 550i GT xDrive, while a luxurious and powerful vehicle, can be prone to several issues. Engine problems like oil leaks and coolant leaks are common and can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues with the mechatronic unit and torque converter can also be costly. Suspension problems with the air suspension can affect ride quality and require replacing air springs or the compressor. Electrical issues, particularly with the iDrive system and battery drain, can be frustrating. These problems range from moderate to severe, and the repair costs can be significant, making it essential to have the vehicle inspected thoroughly before purchase and to budget for potential maintenance and repairs.
