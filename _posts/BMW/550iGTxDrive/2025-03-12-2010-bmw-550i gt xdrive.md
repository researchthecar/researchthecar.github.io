The 550i GT xDrive comes standard with a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, producing 400 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque. All models are equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 550i GT xDrive is appreciated for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. However, some owners have reported concerns about reliability, especially regarding the electrical system and some engine components, as well as higher-than-average maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**N63B44O0 4.4L Twin-Turbo V8**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a fairly common issue, often originating from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil drips on the ground, and a burning oil smell. Low oil levels can also trigger a warning light on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or lines is the standard fix. Thorough cleaning of the engine bay is recommended after the repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the source of the leak and labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Stem Seal Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The N63 engine is known for premature valve stem seal failure. This leads to excessive oil consumption, especially during cold starts. Blue smoke from the exhaust is a telltale sign.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve stem seals requires removing the cylinder heads, a labor-intensive process.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4000 - $8000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are common with the N63 engine, often occurring at the coolant transfer pipe (the "valley pan"), water pump, and radiator hoses. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking components. The valley pan replacement requires significant engine disassembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the location of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Fuel injectors can fail, leading to rough running, misfires, and poor fuel economy. Error codes related to misfires or fuel trim issues are common.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injectors. Sometimes, cleaning the injectors can temporarily resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per injector plus labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 6HP26 6-Speed Automatic**

* **Mechatronic Sleeve Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic sleeve, which seals the electrical connector between the transmission control unit (TCU) and the valve body, can leak transmission fluid. This can lead to erratic shifting, transmission malfunction warnings, and ultimately, transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replacing the mechatronic sleeve and fluid flush.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Valve body problems can cause harsh or delayed shifting, slipping, and erratic gear selection.
    * Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild. Fluid and filter change is recommended after.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Problems (Rear)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear air suspension, which provides self-leveling, can experience issues such as air leaks, compressor failure, and sensor malfunctions. Symptoms include a sagging rear end, suspension malfunction warnings, and a noisy compressor.
    * Solution: Replacing the air springs, compressor, or associated sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per corner.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can be a common issue, often caused by a faulty electronic module not properly going into sleep mode. This can lead to a dead battery, especially if the car sits for an extended period.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and replacing the faulty module, which could be related to the iDrive system, comfort access, or other electronic components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the module.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **iDrive System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The iDrive system, which controls various vehicle functions, can experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure.
    * Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve minor issues. More severe problems may require replacing the iDrive control unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Xenon Headlight Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Xenon headlights can experience ballast failure, causing the lights to flicker or stop working altogether.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty ballast.
