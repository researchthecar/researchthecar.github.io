The 2011 BMW 550i GT xDrive is a unique vehicle, offering a blend of sedan comfort, wagon practicality, and SUV-like ground clearance. The 2011 model year offers two engine options: a 3.0L inline-6 turbocharged engine (535i GT xDrive) and a 4.4L Twin Turbo V8 (550i GT xDrive). The 4.4L V8, found in the 550i GT xDrive, produces 400 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque. This model is known for its luxurious interior, spacious rear seating, and comfortable ride. However, potential downsides include its unusual styling, large size making it harder to park, and potential for costly repairs, particularly related to the complex systems and turbo V8 engine. All models were equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**4.4L Twin Turbo V8 (N63)**

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Stem Seals)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blue smoke upon startup, particularly after the car has been sitting for a while. This indicates oil seeping past the valve stem seals into the combustion chamber.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve stem seals. This is a labor-intensive job.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Turbo Oil Lines)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks visible around the turbos, often accompanied by a burning oil smell. These are the small coolant lines and oil lines on the turbos that tend to dry out.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger oil supply and drain lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks (Coolant Transfer Pipe)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss with no visible external leaks, often resulting in overheating. The coolant transfer pipe runs between the cylinder heads under the intake manifold and is prone to leaking due to the heat cycling of the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the coolant transfer pipe. This requires significant disassembly of the top of the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, poor fuel economy, and possible fuel smell. Direct injectors on the N63 engine are known to fail.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors. It's generally recommended to replace all injectors at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, and transmission fault codes. The valve body contains solenoids and valves that control the flow of transmission fluid, and these can wear out or become clogged over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. Fluid flush may also provide temporary relief.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to valve body issues, including rough shifting, slipping, and fault codes. The mechatronic unit is the electronic control unit for the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reprogramming of the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, the air suspension malfunction warning light illuminating, and the air compressor running constantly or not at all. The compressor provides air to the rear air springs to maintain ride height.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Spring Leaks (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, especially overnight, and a hissing sound coming from the rear suspension. The air springs are rubber bellows that hold air to support the vehicle's weight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+ (per spring)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, especially after the car has been sitting for a few days. This can be caused by a variety of issues, including faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic drain and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **iDrive System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, slow response, and error messages. The iDrive system controls many of the vehicle's functions, including navigation, audio, and climate control.
    *   Solution: Software update, replacement of the iDrive control unit (CIC), or replacement of the screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+

**Summary**

The 2011 BMW 550i GT xDrive, while offering luxury and performance, is known for its potential for costly repairs. The most significant issues revolve around the N63 engine, particularly oil leaks and coolant leaks, which can be expensive to address. Transmission issues with the ZF 8HP can also be a concern. Suspension problems with the air suspension system are relatively common. Electrical gremlins, while less predictable, can also add to the overall cost of ownership. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision and maintenance budget. While the vehicle does have its strengths, the potential for major repairs should not be overlooked.
