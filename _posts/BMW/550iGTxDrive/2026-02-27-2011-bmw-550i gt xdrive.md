### Summary Verdict
The 2011 BMW 550i GT xDrive is a powerful luxury vehicle with a generally solid foundation, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 4.4L twin-turbo V8 engine, while potent, is prone to issues like turbocharger oil leaks, fuel injector failures, and ignition coil problems, which can be costly to repair. The suspension's adaptive systems can also develop faults. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the iDrive system and battery drain, are also noted. The transmission and exterior/interior components appear to be more reliable with fewer widespread reported issues. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a budget for potential repairs are recommended.
