The 2018 BMW 118i is a popular choice for those seeking a premium hatchback experience. The model I will address here is the 118i, which is powered by a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engine producing 136 horsepower and 220 Nm of torque. Other engine options available for the 2018 1 Series included various petrol and diesel engines, such as the 120i with a more powerful petrol engine and the 116d, 118d, and 120d diesel variants. Transmission options typically included a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 118i for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and stylish interior. However, some criticisms include a relatively firm ride and limited rear passenger space.
