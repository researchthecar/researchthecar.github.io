Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2022 BMW 118i, focusing on specific components and their potential problems.

The 2022 BMW 118i is a premium hatchback offering a blend of sporty handling and refined interior. The engine we are focusing on is the 1.5L turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engine, producing 109 horsepower and 190 Nm of torque. Other engine options available include a range of petrol and diesel engines, such as the 116i (similar to the 118i but detuned), the 120i (2.0L petrol), the 116d, 118d, and 120d (diesel variants). Transmission options typically include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. Owners often praise the 118i for its agile handling, upscale interior, and efficient engine. However, some common criticisms include a relatively firm ride (especially with larger wheels), limited rear passenger space, and some cost-cutting measures compared to higher-end BMW models.

**Summary**

The 2022 BMW 118i, while generally reliable, can experience issues common to modern vehicles, particularly related to its engine (coolant and oil leaks), transmission (rough shifting in the DCT), and electrical systems. Many issues are minor and easily addressed with software updates or simple repairs. However, some issues, such as mechatronic unit failure in the transmission or significant electrical drain, can be costly. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and have the car inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase. The most expensive potential repairs are associated with the DCT transmission.
