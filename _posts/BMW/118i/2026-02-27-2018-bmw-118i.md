### Summary Verdict
The 2018 BMW 118i demonstrates good overall reliability, especially concerning its powertrain when properly maintained. The petrol engines, particularly the 2.0L B48, are generally robust, though occasional issues like PCV valve failure or timing chain wear can occur. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission is a strong performer but can be susceptible to mechatronics unit or torque converter problems. Manual transmissions are typically trouble-free. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, are the most commonly cited non-wear-and-tear issues. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are generally durable. Regular servicing and prompt attention to any warning signs are key to maintaining the 118i's reliability.
