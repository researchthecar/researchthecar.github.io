    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty component. This may involve replacing the water pump, thermostat housing, or coolant hoses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component that needs to be replaced
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **Hesitation or Jerky Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported hesitation during acceleration or experiencing jerky shifts between gears. This can be more noticeable during low-speed maneuvers or when shifting from a standstill.
    *   Solution: This can be a complex issue. The first thing to consider is getting the transmission software updated. If the problem persists, a full transmission flush and fill might also need to be done.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $500+ depending on if it can be fixed by updating software, or requires a transmission fluid flush.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or requiring frequent jump starts. This may be due to a parasitic drain caused by a faulty module or electrical component that remains active even when the vehicle is turned off.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic drain using a multimeter and systematically disconnect electrical components to identify the culprit. Repair or replace the faulty module or component causing the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the source of the drain.
