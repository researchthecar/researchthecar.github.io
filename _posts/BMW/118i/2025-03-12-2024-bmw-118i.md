The 2024 BMW 118i is a popular choice in the premium hatchback segment, offering a blend of sporty handling and BMW's signature styling. The 118i is powered by a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 136 horsepower and 220 Nm of torque. Other engine options available are the 116i, 120i, 123i, and M135i, all being gasoline powered. Transmission options primarily include a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic.
