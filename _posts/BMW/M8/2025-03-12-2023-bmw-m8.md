**Summary**

The 2023 BMW M8, while a potent and luxurious vehicle, is not without its potential problems. Engine oil and coolant leaks appear to be the most common mechanical issues, while electrical glitches and infotainment system problems are also present. Harsh shifting from the transmission is another reported issue. While most of these are minor, adaptive damper failures can be an expensive repair. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase.
