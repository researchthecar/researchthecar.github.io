The 2020 BMW M8 is a high-performance luxury grand tourer available as a coupe, convertible, and Gran Coupe (four-door coupe). It's lauded for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and impressive performance capabilities. However, some common criticisms include its high price tag, somewhat harsh ride quality (especially on non-adaptive suspensions), and complex infotainment system. The M8 features a 4.4-liter Twin-Turbo V8 engine. In the standard M8, this engine produces 600 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. The M8 Competition bumps the output to 617 horsepower and retains the same torque figure. Both versions utilize an 8-speed automatic transmission (ZF 8HP).
