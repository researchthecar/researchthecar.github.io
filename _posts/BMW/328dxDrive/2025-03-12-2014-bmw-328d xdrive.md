**Summary**

The 2014 BMW 328d xDrive is a generally reliable car, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly those related to the diesel engine's emissions system. The EGR cooler and DPF are common failure points that can be costly to repair. The transmission mechatronic unit is another area of potential concern.
