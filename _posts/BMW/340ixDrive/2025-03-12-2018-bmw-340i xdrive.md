The 2018 BMW 340i xDrive is a popular sport sedan known for its blend of performance, luxury, and handling. The main engine option is the B58 3.0L turbocharged inline-six, producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. People generally appreciate the car's strong acceleration, comfortable ride, and well-appointed interior. Some common complaints revolve around repair costs, the relatively sterile driving experience compared to older BMWs, and the cost of options. Besides the 340i's B58 inline-six, the 2018 3-series was also available with a 2.0L turbo inline-4. Both engine options were paired with either an 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission.

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points in the cooling system. Common areas are the water pump, thermostat housing, and radiator hoses. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific source of the leak and replace the faulty component (water pump, thermostat housing, or hoses).

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or jerky shifting, especially at low speeds. Hesitation when accelerating can also occur. In some cases, this can be related to the transmission adaptation values needing reset, or low fluid.
    *   Solution: Attempt transmission adaptation reset. Perform a transmission fluid change using the correct BMW-approved fluid. If the problem persists, valve body issues or solenoid failure may require professional diagnosis and repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2000+ (valve body replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Damper/Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the front or rear dampers/struts. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, excessive body roll, and unusual noises (clunking or squeaking) coming from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or damaged dampers/struts. It is recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear) for balanced performance.
