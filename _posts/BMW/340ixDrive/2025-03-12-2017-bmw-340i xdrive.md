The 2017 BMW 340i xDrive is a popular sport sedan known for its performance and handling. The model year features BMW's B58 inline-six engine, producing 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, coupled with an 8-speed automatic transmission. A six-speed manual transmission was also available, but less common. Other engine options for the 2017 3 Series include the 320i's 2.0L turbo four-cylinder and the 330i's higher-output version of the same engine. Owners appreciate the 340i's smooth and powerful engine, responsive handling, and comfortable interior. Common complaints include the cost of maintenance and repairs, some reliability concerns, and the somewhat numb steering feel compared to earlier BMW models.
