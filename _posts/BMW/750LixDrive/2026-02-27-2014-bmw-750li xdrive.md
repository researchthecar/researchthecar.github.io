### Summary Verdict
The 2014 BMW 750Li xDrive is a luxurious and powerful vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 4.4L twin-turbo V8 engine is prone to oil leaks from turbochargers and valve stem seal wear, along with potential fuel injector issues, which can be costly to repair. The suspension, particularly the adaptive systems and rear air springs, can also develop faults requiring significant investment.
