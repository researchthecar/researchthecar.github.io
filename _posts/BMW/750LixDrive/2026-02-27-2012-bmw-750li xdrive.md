### Summary Verdict
The 2012 BMW 750Li xDrive offers a luxurious and powerful experience, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with its 4.4L twin-turbo V8 engine. Issues like turbocharger failure, fuel injector problems, and excessive oil consumption are documented and can be costly to repair.
