Oil and coolant leaks in the engine are relatively common and can be costly to repair. The air suspension can also fail, leading to expensive replacements. Electrical issues with the iDrive system and battery drain can also arise. Due to the age of this vehicle, all rubber parts will need to be inspected and should be replaced. While some issues can be minor, others can be severe and lead to significant repair bills. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic specializing in BMWs to identify any potential problems.
