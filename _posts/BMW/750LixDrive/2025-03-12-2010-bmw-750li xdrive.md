The 2010 BMW 750Li xDrive is a luxury sedan known for its powerful engine, smooth ride, and opulent interior. This model year features a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its performance and comfort, common criticisms include high maintenance costs, complex electronics that can be prone to failure, and a somewhat dated infotainment system compared to newer vehicles. Owners often appreciate the car's driving dynamics and executive feel but are wary of the potential for expensive repairs as the car ages. The 750i and 750Li are rear wheel drive instead of all wheel drive.
