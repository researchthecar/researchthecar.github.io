The 2016 BMW 228i xDrive is a popular compact coupe and convertible known for its sporty handling and premium features. In addition to the xDrive all-wheel-drive model, the 228i was also available in a rear-wheel-drive configuration. Engine options included the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (N20) engine producing 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were either an 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the 228i's fun-to-drive nature, responsive engine, and upscale interior. Some common complaints include a relatively firm ride (especially with the sport suspension), limited rear seat space, and the potential for higher maintenance costs compared to more mainstream vehicles.
