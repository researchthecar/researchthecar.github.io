Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2007 BMW 335xi, categorized and formatted as requested. The 2007 BMW 335xi is a popular all-wheel-drive variant of the E90 3 Series. It's known for its sporty handling and engaging driving experience. The 335xi came standard with BMW's N54 twin-turbocharged 3.0L inline-6 engine, producing 300 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often appreciate the responsive engine and all-weather capability, but some common complaints include relatively high maintenance costs and the need for diligent upkeep to prevent issues, particularly with the early N54 engine.

**Engine**

**N54 3.0L Twin-Turbo Inline-6**

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Long cranks, stalling, rough idle, and a check engine light. The car may go into limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP. Many owners experienced multiple failures. Later revisions of the HPFP were more reliable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, and fuel smell. Can cause catalytic converter damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors on a bank to ensure balanced fuel delivery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+ per injector, potentially $1500 - $3000+ for a full set.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wastegate Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise from the turbos, especially at low RPMs or when letting off the throttle. This is caused by worn wastegate bushings within the turbochargers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbochargers or wastegate repair. Some owners opt for upgraded turbos to avoid future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $5000+ for turbo replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket, Oil Filter Housing Gasket, Oil Pan Gasket)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks, oil consumption, burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets. These are common maintenance items on older BMWs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gasket $300 - $600+, Oil filter housing gasket $300 - $500+, Oil pan gasket $800 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, loss of power, misfires. Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup due to the lack of fuel washing over the intake valves.
    *   Solution: Walnut blasting the intake valves to remove carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues (Water Pump, Thermostat, Radiator Hoses)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks. The electric water pump is a known failure point.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty components. It's often recommended to replace the thermostat and hoses at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Water pump $600 - $1000+, Thermostat $200 - $400+, Hoses $100 - $300+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (GM GA6L45R)**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, harsh or jerky shifts, delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: Often caused by degraded transmission fluid, valve body issues, or worn clutches. A fluid flush and filter change *might* help, but often requires valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $200 - $400+, Valve body repair/replacement $800 - $2000+, Transmission rebuild/replacement $3000 - $6000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual (Getrag GS6-17BG)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially over bumps. Reduced steering precision.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the control arm bushings or the entire control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushing replacement $300 - $600+, Control arm replacement $400 - $800+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per axle.

**Summary**

The 2007 BMW 335xi, while offering a desirable blend of performance and all-weather capability, is known for its potential for costly repairs, especially regarding the N54 engine. Issues such as HPFP failure, fuel injector problems, and wastegate rattle are prevalent and can lead to significant expenses. Routine maintenance, including oil changes and addressing coolant leaks promptly, is crucial to mitigate these problems. The automatic transmission can also present issues as the car ages, requiring potential repairs or replacement. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for higher-than-average maintenance costs.
