Here's a breakdown of common issues reported by owners of the 2009 Dodge Ram 5500, categorized for clarity.

The 2009 Dodge Ram 5500 is a heavy-duty work truck known for its robust capabilities and towing capacity. Engine options for the 2009 model year include a 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel inline-6, and a 5.7L HEMI V8 gasoline engine. The 6.7L Cummins, the most popular choice, produces around 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consisted of either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Ram 5500 for its powerful engine, strong chassis, and overall reliability as a workhorse. Common complaints tend to center around fuel economy, some electrical gremlins, and the general maintenance costs associated with heavy-duty vehicles.

**Engine**

**6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, excessive black smoke, unusual noises from the turbocharger, potential engine damage. Can be caused by oil starvation, foreign object damage, or excessive exhaust temperatures.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Ensure proper oil supply to the new turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, white smoke, decreased fuel economy, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors. Proper diagnosis is crucial to identify the affected injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per injector (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and potential for the engine to stall. The EGR valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR valve or, in some cases, clean it (though replacement is often the more reliable long-term solution).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **"HEMI Tick" (Valve Train Noise)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or tapping sound from the engine, particularly at idle or low RPM. Often attributed to lifter issues or exhaust manifold leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial. Could involve replacing lifters, exhaust manifold gaskets, or addressing other valve train components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the root cause and extent of repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (AS69RC/Aisin)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slipping between gears, and potential for complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild may be necessary if the issue has caused further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, and potential for the transmission to get stuck in a gear.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and loose steering. These trucks are heavy, and ball joints can wear out prematurely, especially with heavy use.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per pair (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, reduced load-carrying capacity, and potential for leaf springs to break.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or broken leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting issues, fuel pump relay failure, lighting problems, and other electrical gremlins. The TIPM controls many of the vehicle's electrical functions, and failures can be widespread.
    *   Solution: Replace the TIPM. In some cases, it may be possible to repair the TIPM, but replacement is often the more reliable solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion or damage to wiring harnesses can cause a variety of electrical problems, including sensor failures, lighting issues, and starting problems.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the damaged wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the extent of the damage. $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Cab Corners and Rocker Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust development, especially in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted body panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in vehicles exposed to high heat and sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or install a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the solution chosen.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Dodge Ram 5500 is a capable heavy-duty truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine-related problems, especially with the Cummins diesel (turbo, fuel injectors, EGR), can be costly. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, are also a concern. Electrical problems related to the TIPM and wiring harnesses can be frustrating and require specialized diagnostics. Suspension wear and tear are common given the truck's heavy-duty nature. Overall, potential repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. Addressing potential rust issues is also essential to maintain the vehicle's longevity.
