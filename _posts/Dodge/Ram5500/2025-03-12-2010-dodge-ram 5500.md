The 2010 Dodge Ram 5500 is a heavy-duty work truck designed for demanding tasks. Engine options include the 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6, producing 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque, and the 5.7L Hemi V8. Transmission options are primarily the 6-speed Aisin AS69RC automatic for diesel models and the 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual for the gasoline model. Owners appreciate the Ram 5500's robust towing and payload capacity, as well as its rugged build. Common dislikes often include the firm ride, fuel economy (especially with the diesel), and some reported reliability issues, primarily associated with the diesel engine's emissions system and the automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2010 Dodge Ram 5500, while a capable work truck, can suffer from some notable issues. The diesel engine, particularly its emissions system, is a frequent source of problems, and transmission issues, especially with the Aisin automatic, can be costly. Electrical problems related to the TIPM are also common. Suspension and steering components may need replacement over time due to the heavy-duty nature of the truck. While some issues can be relatively inexpensive to address (sensor replacements, headlight restoration), others (turbocharger failure, DPF issues, transmission rebuilds) can be quite costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and be aware of these potential problem areas.
