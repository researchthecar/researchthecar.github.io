### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Dodge Ram 5500, particularly with the 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel engine, is a capable workhorse. However, common issues like EGR cooler failures, turbocharger problems, and fuel injector issues require attention. Transmission reliability is generally good, but the 68RFE automatic can experience torque converter problems and overheating, while the G56 manual may need clutch replacements. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can wear under heavy use. Electrical systems can be prone to alternator failures. Overall, while the Ram 5500 is built for durability, proactive maintenance and awareness of these potential issues are crucial for long-term reliability.
