The 2000 Dodge Avenger was a mid-size coupe offering a mix of affordability and sporty styling. Available engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 140 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L V6 engine producing 163 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, although the 2.0L engine could be found with a 5-speed manual in some instances. Owners generally liked the Avenger's aggressive looks and comfortable ride, but common complaints centered around reliability issues, particularly with the automatic transmission, and the quality of interior components.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often originating from the valve cover gasket or oil pan gasket. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and oil spots on the ground.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine overheating, often caused by a faulty thermostat, radiator issues, or a clogged cooling system. Can result in serious engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the thermostat, flush the cooling system, repair or replace the radiator, and check for leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**2.5L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt can fail if not replaced at recommended intervals, leading to significant engine damage, including bent valves and damaged pistons.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt according to the manufacturer's recommendations (typically every 60,000 to 100,000 miles). If the belt breaks, the engine needs a complete rebuild.

**Summary**

The 2000 Dodge Avenger, while stylish, suffers from a variety of reliability issues, particularly concerning its automatic transmission and engine oil leaks. Suspension wear and electrical problems are also common. Repair costs can range from minor fixes to more substantial engine or transmission work, potentially making it an expensive vehicle to maintain in the long run. The severity of the issues depends greatly on the specific configuration of the vehicle (2.0L vs. 2.5L) and how well it was maintained.
