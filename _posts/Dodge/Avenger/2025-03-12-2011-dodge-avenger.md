The 2011 Dodge Avenger is a mid-size sedan that offered a mix of affordability and styling. Engine options for the 2011 Avenger include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 producing 186 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.7L and 3.6L engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Avenger's distinctive styling and relatively spacious interior for its class, but criticisms frequently centered on the quality of interior materials, handling, and the performance of the 2.4L engine and 4-speed transmission.

**Summary:**

The 2011 Dodge Avenger presents several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some, like the TIPM failure and transmission problems, potentially leading to significant repair bills.
