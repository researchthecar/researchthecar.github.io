Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder producing around 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 producing approximately 186 horsepower and 191 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing approximately 235 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were generally a 4-speed automatic for the 2.4L and 2.7L engines and a 6-speed automatic for the 3.5L engine. Owners often appreciated the Avenger's styling and relatively affordable price point. Common dislikes included concerns about reliability, build quality, and overall performance compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the 2.4L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, leading to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and the need for frequent oil top-offs.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels frequently and addressing any leaks. If consumption is excessive, a compression test and leak-down test can help determine if piston rings or valve seals are the cause. Repair could involve replacing piston rings, valve seals, or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly, particularly at idle or low speeds. This can be due to a faulty throttle body, crankshaft or camshaft position sensor issues, or a vacuum leak.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the stalling using a scan tool to check for error codes. Cleaning or replacing the throttle body, replacing the crankshaft or camshaft position sensor, or repairing any vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the part and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6**

*   **Engine Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 engine is known for being prone to sludge buildup if oil changes are not performed regularly. This can lead to reduced oil flow, overheating, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Frequent oil changes using high-quality synthetic oil. Engine flush treatments may help in mild cases. In severe cases, the engine may need to be disassembled and cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ depending on the severity of the sludge and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Typically paired with 2.4L and 2.7L)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission may exhibit rough shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement. This can be due to worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A transmission flush and filter change may help in mild cases. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced, or the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Typically paired with 3.5L)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks can wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the quality of the replacement parts and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clunking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially over bumps, can indicate worn sway bar links, ball joints, or control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspecting the suspension components for wear and play. Replacing worn sway bar links, ball joints, or control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM can experience various problems, including intermittent starting issues, fuel pump relay failure, and malfunctioning accessories.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the TIPM. This is a common issue with Chrysler vehicles from this era.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on the repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
