### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Dodge Avenger presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components like the engines and transmissions are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil and coolant leaks, particularly with the 2.4L and 3.6L engines. Transmission problems, including harsh shifting and overheating, can also arise, often requiring significant repair costs. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts are common wear items that may need replacement. Electrically, the Body Control Module (BCM) and alternator are known to cause various intermittent problems. Exterior concerns include rust, especially in certain climates, and headlight condensation. Interiorly, HVAC blower motors and the Uconnect infotainment system can be sources of frustration. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential issues and maintaining the vehicle's overall reliability.
