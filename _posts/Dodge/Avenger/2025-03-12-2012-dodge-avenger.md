The 2012 Dodge Avenger aimed to offer a stylish and affordable mid-size sedan option. It was available with a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, as well as a more powerful 3.6L Pentastar V6 generating 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L was paired with a 4-speed or 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6L exclusively used a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Avenger's bold styling and spacious interior, especially for its price point. However, common complaints revolved around the base engine's lackluster performance, the overall build quality, and reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly, especially at idle or low speeds. A rough or erratic idle may also be present. Some owners report that this is more noticeable when the AC is turned on.
    *   Solution: Potential causes include a faulty throttle position sensor, a dirty or malfunctioning idle air control valve (if equipped), vacuum leaks, or issues with the engine control unit (ECU) software. Diagnosis by a qualified technician is needed to pinpoint the exact cause. Replacing the faulty component or reprogramming the ECU are common fixes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: The cause of oil consumption can be multifaceted, ranging from worn piston rings/cylinder walls, faulty PCV valve, or oil leaks. A compression test and leak-down test can help assess the engine's internal condition. Depending on the cause, repairs could range from PCV valve replacement to more extensive engine work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3000+, depending on the source and extent of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic oil filter housing is prone to cracking and leaking oil. This can manifest as oil spots on the ground or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing is the common fix. It is recommended to use an updated metal version of the oil filter housing to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low or contaminated transmission fluid, faulty shift solenoids, or internal wear. A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement can sometimes alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, solenoid replacement or a transmission rebuild/replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L and 3.6L)**

*   **Hesitation/Delay in Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay or hesitation when shifting gears, especially when accelerating or trying to pass another vehicle.
    *   Solution: Potential causes include low transmission fluid, faulty solenoids, or issues with the transmission control module (TCM). A fluid check/fill, solenoid replacement, or TCM reprogramming/replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and a generally uncomfortable ride. Noises such as clunking when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts and shocks is the standard solution. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Tie Rod End Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, wandering on the road, and uneven tire wear. A clunking noise may be heard when turning the steering wheel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty tie rod end(s) is required, followed by a wheel alignment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per tie rod end.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a very common and troublesome issue. Symptoms may include intermittent starting problems, fuel pump relay failure (leading to stalling), power window malfunctions, lighting issues, and erratic behavior of various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM is the common fix. However, some owners have had success with DIY repairs focusing on relay soldering. Due to the TIPM's complexity, professional diagnosis and replacement are generally recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows may stop working intermittently or completely. The window motor, regulator, or switch could be the cause.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the faulty component (motor, regulator, or switch) followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings.
    *   Solution: Some owners attempt to seal the headlight housing or drill a small drain hole. The most reliable solution is to replace the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per headlight.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, often due to sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Options range from dashboard covers to complete dashboard replacement. Some owners attempt to repair cracks with fillers and vinyl repair kits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction of the HVAC system, often resulting in only hot or cold air blowing from the vents, or inconsistent temperatures on different sides of the vehicle. Clicking noises may also be heard from behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator is the fix. This can be a labor-intensive job due to the actuator's location behind the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Dodge Avenger has several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant concern is the TIPM failure, which can lead to a variety of electrical problems and potentially leave the vehicle stranded. Oil filter housing leaks on the 3.6L V6 and transmission issues on both the 4-speed and 6-speed automatics are also noteworthy. Suspension components like struts and tie rod ends are prone to premature wear. Interior issues like dashboard cracking and blend door actuator failure can affect the vehicle's comfort and aesthetics. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, and the estimated costs to fix them can vary widely. Due to these potential reliability issues, it is recommended to have a thorough inspection performed by a qualified mechanic before purchasing a used 2012 Dodge Avenger.
