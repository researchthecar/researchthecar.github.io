### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Dodge Avenger presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. While the V6 engines generally fare better, the 2.4L four-cylinder can experience common issues like oil and cooling system leaks. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic gearboxes, are a notable concern, ranging from harsh shifting to hesitation. Suspension components like ball joints and struts may require attention sooner than expected. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Exterior rust and interior HVAC blend door failures are other potential areas for repair. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potential maintenance and repair costs, especially concerning the powertrain and suspension.
