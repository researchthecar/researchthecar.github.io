The 2013 Dodge Avenger is a mid-size sedan that was offered with three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 producing 186 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Avenger's aggressive styling and spacious interior. However, common complaints include lackluster fuel economy, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potentially engine knocking or failure.
    *   Solution: The repair can range from replacing the PCV valve to replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly while driving or idling. This can be intermittent and may be accompanied by a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking the throttle body, mass airflow sensor, and crankshaft position sensor. Repair typically involves replacing the faulty sensor or cleaning the throttle body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic oil filter housing can crack or warp, leading to oil leaks. Symptoms include oil dripping from the engine, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil filter housing with an updated aluminum version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. Symptoms include a rough idle, loss of power, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cylinder(s) causing the misfire and replace the faulty component(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per cylinder
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L)**
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifting between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: The transmission may require a fluid flush and filter change. In some cases, valve body issues may necessitate replacement or rebuild of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with V6 engines)**

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into drive or reverse and the vehicle actually moving.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, internal transmission damage may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,500+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, slipping, or complete loss of drive can indicate torque converter failure.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bumpy or unstable ride, excessive body roll in turns, and longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Clunking Noises from Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension while driving over bumps. Could be worn sway bar links, ball joints, or control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls various electrical functions, and failures can lead to a wide range of issues, including fuel pump relay failure (causing no-start conditions), power window malfunctions, and intermittent stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: NHTSA Campaign Number: 14V530000

**Summary**

The 2013 Dodge Avenger has a mix of reliability concerns. Engine issues, particularly oil consumption in the 2.4L and oil filter housing leaks in the 3.6L, and TIPM electrical failures are among the most concerning due to their potential cost and impact on drivability. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as transmission problems or TIPM failures, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase.
