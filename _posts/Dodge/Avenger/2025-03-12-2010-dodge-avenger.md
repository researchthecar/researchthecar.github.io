Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2010 Dodge Avenger, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2010 Dodge Avenger was a mid-size sedan aimed at providing a blend of style and affordability. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4, a 2.7L V6, and a 3.5L V6. The 2.4L produced around 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, making it the most fuel-efficient option. The 2.7L V6 was rated at 186 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque. The 3.5L V6 delivered a more robust 235 hp and 232 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 4-speed automatic (with the 2.4L and 2.7L) and a 6-speed automatic (with the 3.5L). Owners often liked the Avenger's distinctive styling and available features for the price, but common dislikes included the interior quality, perceived reliability, and somewhat unrefined driving experience.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms can include a burning oil smell, blue smoke from the exhaust, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: The solution will vary based on the cause of the oil consumption. Sometimes it is caused by worn piston rings, valve seals, or a PCV valve issue. In more severe cases, engine replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can cause rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light to illuminate. Often related to ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with an OBD-II scanner to identify the affected cylinder(s). Replace faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per cylinder
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water pump failure can lead to overheating, coolant leaks, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a whining noise from the engine, visible coolant leaks near the water pump, and a temperature gauge reading high.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump. It's often recommended to replace the timing chain at the same time, as it's often located nearby.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 is prone to sludge buildup if oil changes are neglected. Sludge can restrict oil flow, leading to engine damage and premature wear. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, low oil pressure, and overheating.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality oil are crucial. In severe cases, engine cleaning or even engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for oil change and cleaning) - $4,000+ (for engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.4L and 2.7L)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between gears. Can also experience transmission slipping, where the engine revs without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: Fluid change, valve body replacement, or full transmission rebuild/replacement. Start with a fluid change to see if it improves the shifting, and if not the next thing would be to drop the transmission pan and inspect the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause stalling, shuddering, or difficulty accelerating. Symptoms include a noticeable shudder or vibration when accelerating, especially at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 3.5L)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and failure of front strut mounts. Symptoms include clunking noises when going over bumps, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front strut mounts, and possibly the struts themselves if they are worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken or worn sway bar links can cause clunking or rattling noises, especially when turning or going over bumps. It results in poor handling and instability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls various electrical functions in the vehicle. Failures can lead to a wide range of problems, including fuel pump relay failure (resulting in stalling), erratic windshield wiper operation, and starting problems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM. Some independent shops can repair specific issues within the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working intermittently or completely. This can be due to a faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause (motor, regulator, or switch). Replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per window.
    *    Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust development on lower body panels, particularly around the wheel wells and rocker panels, especially in areas with harsh winters.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, patching, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per panel.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Dodge Avenger has several common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly with the 2.4L and 2.7L engines regarding oil consumption and sludge buildup, can lead to costly repairs. Electrical problems with the TIPM can also cause a range of frustrating symptoms. Suspension and interior issues are less severe but can still add to the overall cost of ownership. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Careful inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
