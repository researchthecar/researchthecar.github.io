The 2009 Dodge Avenger is a mid-size sedan that offered a mix of affordability and style. Engine choices included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 producing 186 horsepower and 191 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 235 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L was typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 engines used a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the Avenger's exterior styling and spacious interior for its class. However, common criticisms included lackluster fuel economy, a somewhat unrefined driving experience, and concerns about long-term reliability.

**Engine**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil light illumination, engine knocking or ticking noises, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions range from replacing the PCV valve to address potential crankcase pressure issues to more extensive repairs like piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3,000+

**2.7L V6**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls unexpectedly while driving, especially at low speeds or when idling.

**Summary**

The 2009 Dodge Avenger presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While some problems are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others, such as TIPM failures or timing chain issues on the 3.5L V6, can be significant and costly. The electrical and transmission issues seem to be the most prevalent and potentially disruptive, affecting overall reliability. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and be aware of these potential problems, especially considering the age of the vehicle.
