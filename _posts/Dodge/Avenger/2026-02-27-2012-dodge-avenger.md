### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Dodge Avenger presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly oil and coolant leaks in both the 4-cylinder and V6 engines, and occasional transmission shifting problems. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts can also require attention. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module or alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior concerns include rust in certain climates and headlight hazing. Interior issues like HVAC blower motor failure and premature upholstery wear are also reported. While not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs and consider a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
