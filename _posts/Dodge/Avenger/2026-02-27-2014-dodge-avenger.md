### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Dodge Avenger presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly oil and coolant leaks in both the 4-cylinder and V6 engines, and potential transmission problems like harsh shifting or leaks. Suspension components, such as ball joints and strut mounts, can also wear out. Electrical gremlins, like faulty window motors and instrument clusters, are not uncommon. Exterior concerns include paint durability and headlight clarity. Interior issues often center on the HVAC blower motor and general wear on seat fabrics. While not plagued by catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential maintenance and repair points to keep the Avenger running smoothly.
