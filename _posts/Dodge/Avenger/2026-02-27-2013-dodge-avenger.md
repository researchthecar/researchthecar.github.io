### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Dodge Avenger presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly oil leaks in both the 4-cylinder and V6 engines, and potential transmission problems like harsh shifting or TCM faults in the 6-speed automatic. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, are also noted. Exterior paint durability and interior HVAC blower motor failures are other areas to be aware of. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should budget for potential repairs related to these specific components to maintain optimal performance and longevity.
