The 2014 Dodge Avenger is a mid-size sedan that offered a blend of affordability and classic styling. Available engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 delivering 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6L V6 came standard with a 6-speed automatic. Drivers often appreciated the Avenger's spacious interior and easy-to-use infotainment system, and disliked its fuel economy, unrefined driving dynamics, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, check engine light illumination with codes indicating misfires on specific cylinders (e.g., P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304). Often caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s) and/or spark plugs. Diagnosing other potential causes like fuel injectors or vacuum leaks may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the number of coils/plugs replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak near the oil filter adapter housing, often dripping onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the entire oil filter adapter housing (often comes with a new oil filter). The original housings were prone to cracking and leaking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or complete loss of drive in certain gears. Can be related to low transmission fluid or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Start by checking and potentially changing the transmission fluid. If the issue persists, internal repairs or a transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2,500+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 3.6L engine)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Erratic Behavior**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or clunky shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or unexpected downshifts. Can also result in the transmission getting stuck in one gear.
    *   Solution: Often linked to the valve body. Replacing the valve body may resolve the issue. Sometimes a software update can help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Clunking Noises from Front Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A clunking or rattling noise emanating from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Often related to worn sway bar links or control arm bushings.

    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Windshield Wiper Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windshield wipers stop working intermittently or only work on one speed, regardless of the switch setting.
    *   Solution: Check and replace the wiper motor. Inspect the wiper linkage for binding.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation buildup inside the headlight housings.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlight housing and dry it out, reseal the headlight assembly to prevent further moisture intrusion. Or replace the assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on DIY vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks developing on the dashboard surface, often in areas exposed to direct sunlight.

**Summary**

The 2014 Dodge Avenger has several reported issues across various components. The engine and transmission issues, particularly those affecting the 6-speed automatic and 3.6L V6, can be relatively costly to repair. Electrical problems related to the TIPM are another significant concern. While some repairs are minor, others can be quite expensive. The severity of the issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
