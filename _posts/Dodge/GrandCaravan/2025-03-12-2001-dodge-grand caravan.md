**Summary**

The 2001 Dodge Grand Caravan, while offering space and versatility, suffers from a range of issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues are relatively common, with the 3.3L V6 being particularly prone to intake manifold gasket leaks. Transmission problems such as slipping and harsh shifting can be costly to repair. Suspension components like struts, shocks, and ball joints are also susceptible to wear and tear. Electrical problems, especially with power windows and sliding doors, can be frustrating. Exterior rust is a concern, and interior issues like dashboard cracking detract from the vehicle's overall appeal. While some of these repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or rust repair, can be quite costly, making a thorough inspection essential before purchasing.
