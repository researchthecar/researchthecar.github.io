The 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan is a popular minivan known for its versatility and family-friendly features. It offers various seating configurations, a spacious interior, and convenient features like Stow 'n Go seating. However, it also has its share of problems. Owners appreciate the van's affordability and practicality, but common complaints include electrical issues, transmission problems, and overall reliability concerns. The 2007 Grand Caravan offered three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 (150 hp, 165 lb-ft of torque), a 3.3L V6 (175 hp, 205 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.8L V6 (205 hp, 240 lb-ft of torque). The 2.4L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.3L and 3.8L engines were usually paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, although some higher trim levels with the 3.8L engine could have a 6-speed automatic transmission.
