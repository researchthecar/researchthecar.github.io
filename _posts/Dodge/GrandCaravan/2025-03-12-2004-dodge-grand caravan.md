The 2004 Dodge Grand Caravan is a popular minivan known for its versatility and affordability. It offered several engine options including a 2.4L inline-4 (150 hp, 165 lb-ft torque), a 3.3L V6 (180 hp, 210 lb-ft torque), and a 3.8L V6 (215 hp, 245 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Grand Caravan for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and Stow 'n Go seating (available on some models). Common complaints included reliability issues, particularly with the transmission and electrical systems, as well as a perceived lack of refinement compared to some competitors.
