### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Dodge Grand Caravan offers a practical and spacious solution for family transportation, but potential buyers should be aware of its reliability quirks. The V6 engines, particularly the 3.8L, are prone to more significant issues like head gasket failures, while the 3.3L can suffer from intake manifold leaks. Transmission problems, especially with the torque converter clutch and solenoid packs, are also a concern. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and power window failures, can add to ownership costs. While suspension components can wear, they are generally manageable. The exterior is typically robust, and interior components, apart from the HVAC blend door actuator, tend to hold up well. Careful inspection and maintenance are key to mitigating potential issues.
