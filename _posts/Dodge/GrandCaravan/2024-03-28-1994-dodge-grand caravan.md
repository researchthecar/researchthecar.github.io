## The 1994 Dodge Grand Caravan

The 1994 Dodge Grand Caravan was a popular minivan that offered a spacious interior and a variety of engine and transmission options. It was powered by a choice of three engines: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 122 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0-liter V6 with 150 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3-liter V6 with 162 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a three-speed automatic and a four-speed automatic.
