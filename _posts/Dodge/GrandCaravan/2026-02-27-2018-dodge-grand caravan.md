### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan generally presents a solid reliability record, particularly with its well-established 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to minor oil and coolant leaks from the engine, and occasional transmission shifting anomalies or overheating, which are often addressable with maintenance or component replacement. Electrical gremlins, especially concerning the Body Control Module and power sliding doors, can arise and require specific diagnosis. While the exterior remains largely trouble-free, the interior's Uconnect infotainment system may experience occasional software glitches. Overall, the Grand Caravan remains a practical choice, but owners should be aware of these potential, though not universal, reliability concerns.
