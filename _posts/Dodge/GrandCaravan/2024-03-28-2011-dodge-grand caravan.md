**Introduction to the 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan**

The 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan is a popular minivan known for its spacious interior, practicality, and affordable price. It comes with several engine and transmission options, including a 3.3L V6 with a 6-speed automatic transmission, a 3.8L V6 with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and a 4.0L V6 with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

While the Grand Caravan offers many sought-after features, it has also faced criticism for its below-average crash test ratings, unrefined driving experience, and subpar fuel economy.
