### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Dodge Grand Caravan presents a mixed reliability profile. The standard 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine is generally robust, but owners should be aware of potential leaks from the intake manifold and oil filter housing. The 6-speed automatic transmission can experience issues with harsh shifting and overheating, often requiring fluid services or more significant repairs. Suspension components like sway bar links and struts may require attention sooner than expected. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module and alternator, are also noted. Exterior issues often involve the sliding door and liftgate mechanisms. Interior reliability is generally good, with the HVAC blower motor being a common point of failure. Overall, while not without its quirks, many Grand Caravans provide dependable service with proactive maintenance and attention to these known problem areas.
