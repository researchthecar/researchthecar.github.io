The 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan is a popular minivan known for its versatility and family-friendly features. It came with three engine options: a 3.3L V6 producing 175 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque, a 3.8L V6 producing 205 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 producing 251 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque.
