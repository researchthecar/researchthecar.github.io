The 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan is a popular minivan known for its spacious interior and versatility. Engine options for this year included a 2.4L inline-4 producing approximately 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, a 3.3L V6 producing approximately 180 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 producing approximately 215 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 engines also used a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Grand Caravan for its comfortable ride, ample storage, and Stow 'n Go seating (if equipped). However, common complaints included issues with reliability, particularly concerning the transmission and electrical systems, and relatively poor fuel economy.
