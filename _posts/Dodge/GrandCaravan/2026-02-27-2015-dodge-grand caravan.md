### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Dodge Grand Caravan, powered by the robust 3.6L Pentastar V6, generally offers decent reliability. However, common issues tend to center around the 62TE automatic transmission, with reports of harsh shifting and overheating. Engine-related concerns include leaks from the intake manifold and oil filter housing. On the suspension front, sway bar links and struts can experience wear. Electrical gremlins can manifest through the Body Control Module or power sliding door actuators. Interior climate control, specifically blend door actuators, can also be a point of failure. While not overwhelmingly problematic, owners should be aware of these potential repair areas and factor them into long-term ownership costs.
