The 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan is a minivan known for its spaciousness and practicality. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, a 3.3L V6 producing 180 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 producing 215 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.3L and 3.8L engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission as well, albeit slightly different versions of it to handle the additional power. Owners generally appreciate the Grand Caravan's affordability, cargo capacity, and comfortable ride. However, common complaints include reliability issues, especially with the power sliding doors and some engine components, as well as the somewhat dated interior styling.
