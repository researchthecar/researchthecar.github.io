The 2014 Dodge Grand Caravan is a popular minivan known for its affordability, practicality, and spaciousness. It was offered with a single engine option: the 3.6L Pentastar V6, producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Stow 'n Go seating, which allows for easy folding of the second and third-row seats into the floor, creating a large cargo area. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated interior, relatively poor fuel economy, and potential reliability issues.

Electrical problems stemming from the TIPM can also be frustrating and expensive. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others, like a complete transmission failure, can be quite significant.
