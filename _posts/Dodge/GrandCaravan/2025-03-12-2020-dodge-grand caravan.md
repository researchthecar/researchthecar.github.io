The 2020 Dodge Grand Caravan is a minivan known for its affordability, practicality, and spacious interior. It comes standard with a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its budget-friendly price point and passenger/cargo capacity, it's often criticized for its dated design, lower fuel economy compared to newer minivans, and fewer advanced safety features.
