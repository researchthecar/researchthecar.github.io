Other engine options included a 5.9L V8 with 245 horsepower and 345 lb-ft of torque, and a 8.0L V10 with 310 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic, a 5-speed manual, and a 6-speed manual.

The B3500 was praised for its powerful engines, spacious cab, and comfortable ride. However, it was also criticized for its poor fuel economy and outdated interior.

**Engine Issues:**

**5.2L V8**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** A faulty intake manifold gasket can cause coolant and oil leaks, rough idling, and a decrease in power. The gasket can be replaced for around $200 - $300.
* **Exhaust manifold cracking:** Exhaust manifold cracks can cause a loss of power, a decrease in fuel economy, and a loud exhaust noise. The manifold can be replaced for around $400 - $600.
* **Head gasket failure:** A blown head gasket can cause coolant and oil leaks, overheating, and a loss of power. The head gasket can be replaced for around $1,000 - $1,500.

**5.9L V8**

* **Cam position sensor failure:** A faulty cam position sensor can cause the engine to stall, run rough, or fail to start. The sensor can be replaced for around $100 - $150.
* **Crankshaft position sensor failure:** A faulty crankshaft position sensor can cause the engine to stall or fail to start. The sensor can be replaced for around $100 - $150.
* **Oxygen sensor failure:** A faulty oxygen sensor can cause the engine to run rich or lean, which can lead to decreased fuel economy and emissions problems. The sensor can be replaced for around $100 - $200.

**8.0L V10**

* **Connecting rod failure:** A faulty connecting rod can cause catastrophic engine damage. The engine will need to be rebuilt or replaced, which can cost $5,000 or more.

**Transmission Issues:**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **TCC solenoid failure:** A faulty TCC solenoid can cause the transmission to slip or shudder when shifting. The solenoid can be replaced for around $200 - $300.
* **Torque converter failure:** A faulty torque converter can cause the transmission to slip or shudder, and it can also lead to overheating. The torque converter can be replaced for around $700 - $1,000.
* **Transmission fluid leaks:** Transmission fluid leaks can occur from a variety of places, including the pan gasket, the input shaft seal, and the output shaft seal. Leaks can be fixed by replacing the faulty seal or gasket. The cost of the repair will vary depending on the location of the leak.

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** A worn clutch can cause the transmission to slip or chatter. The clutch can be replaced for around $400 - $600.
