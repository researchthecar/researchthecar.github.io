Alright, here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2009 Dodge Challenger, categorized by component and powertrain configuration.

The 2009 Dodge Challenger marked the return of a classic muscle car. Available engines included a 3.5L V6 producing 250 hp and 250 lb-ft of torque, a 5.7L HEMI V8 producing 372 hp and 398 lb-ft of torque (with the automatic transmission), and 376 hp and 410 lb-ft of torque (with the manual transmission). The 6.1L HEMI V8 was exclusive to the SRT8 and produced 425 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 4-speed automatic (3.5L V6), a 5-speed automatic (5.7L HEMI V8), and a 6-speed manual (5.7L HEMI V8 and 6.1L HEMI V8). Owners often praise the Challenger's retro styling, spacious interior, and powerful engine options. Common complaints include the car's large size and weight, which can affect handling, and fuel economy, especially with the V8 engines. Some owners also found the interior materials to be lacking compared to competitors.
