### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Dodge Challenger generally presents a solid mechanical foundation, particularly with its manual transmission and the 6.4L SRT engine, which show few widespread issues. The V6 and 5.7L HEMI engines have some documented concerns, notably oil cooler leaks and potential lifter/camshaft wear on the HEMI due to the MDS system, requiring attention. Automatic transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, can arise and may necessitate costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or infotainment system, are also reported. Interior and exterior components are largely reliable, with minor issues like headlight condensation being the most common. Overall, while not immune to problems, many 2013 Challengers offer a reliable experience, especially when properly maintained and when specific powertrain options are chosen.
