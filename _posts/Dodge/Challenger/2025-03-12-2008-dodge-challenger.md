Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2008 Dodge Challenger, categorized by component and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2008 Dodge Challenger marked the return of a muscle car icon. Engine options included a 3.5L V6 producing 250 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, a 5.7L HEMI V8 making 372 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque (with the manual transmission) or 340 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque (with the automatic), and later in the year, a 6.1L HEMI V8 boasting 425 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions were a 5-speed automatic (with the 3.5L and lower-output 5.7L HEMI) and a 6-speed manual (with the higher-output 5.7L and the 6.1L HEMI).
