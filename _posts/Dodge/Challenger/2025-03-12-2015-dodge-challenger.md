The 2015 Dodge Challenger is a popular muscle car known for its retro styling, powerful engine options, and comfortable ride. It offered a range of engines, from the fuel-efficient V6 to the ferocious supercharged Hellcat V8. Engine options included the 3.6L Pentastar V6 (305 horsepower, 268 lb-ft of torque), the 5.7L Hemi V8 (375 horsepower, 410 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.4L Hemi V8 (485 horsepower, 475 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic, depending on the engine. People love the Challenger for its aggressive looks, powerful engines, and relatively spacious interior compared to other muscle cars. Common dislikes include its large size, which can make it feel cumbersome in tight spaces, and its relatively poor fuel economy, especially with the V8 engines.
