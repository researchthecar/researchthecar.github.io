The 2013 Dodge Challenger is a popular choice for drivers seeking a blend of retro styling, performance, and comfort. Available in a variety of trims, the Challenger boasts a distinct muscle car aesthetic and a spacious interior. The base engine is a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 305 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque. For those craving more power, a range of V8 options are available, including the 5.7L Hemi V8 (375 hp and 410 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.4L Hemi V8 (470 hp and 470 lb-ft of torque). Transmission choices include a 5-speed automatic (with the 3.6L V6), a 6-speed manual, and a 5-speed automatic (both with the 5.7L and 6.4L Hemi V8 engines). Owners appreciate the Challenger's bold design, powerful engine options, and relatively comfortable ride. Common complaints include a large turning radius, poor fuel economy (especially with the V8 engines), and some concerns about reliability.
