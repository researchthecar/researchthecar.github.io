The 2022 Dodge Challenger is a retro-styled muscle car known for its powerful engines, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Engine options range from the base 3.6L Pentastar V6 (303 hp, 268 lb-ft of torque) to the monstrous supercharged 6.2L Hemi V8 in various trims, including the Hellcat (717 hp) and the Redeye (797 hp). The Challenger is loved for its aggressive styling and available horsepower, but some dislike its age and lack of modern technology compared to competitors. Transmission choices include a Tremec 6 speed manual and an 8-speed TorqueFlite automatic.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Cylinder Head Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cylinder head failures, typically manifesting as engine misfires, rough idling, and potentially a check engine light. This issue seems to be more prevalent in earlier model years of vehicles equipped with the Pentastar V6 but can occur in later years.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected cylinder head is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **"Hemi Tick" Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or tapping noise originating from the engine, often described as the "Hemi tick." While the exact cause is debated, it's often attributed to the valvetrain, potentially related to the MDS (Multi-Displacement System) or a lifter issue. The noise may be more noticeable at idle and low speeds.
    *   Solution: The solutions vary. Some owners have success with oil changes using specific oil weights or additives. Others require replacement of lifters or other valvetrain components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (oil change/additives) - $3,000+ (lifter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L Supercharged Hemi V8 (Hellcat/Redeye)**

*   **Supercharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some reports indicate potential issues with the supercharger, including excessive noise, loss of boost, or even failure. This can result in reduced performance and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial, and solutions range from supercharger rebuilds to complete replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed TorqueFlite Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or harsh shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation during acceleration, especially from a stop, has also been noted.
    *   Solution: Software updates/reflashes of the transmission control module (TCM) are often attempted first. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or even a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (reflash) - $4,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates are the first step. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is required to identify the source of the drain (e.g., faulty module, parasitic draw). Repair can involve replacing the battery, fixing wiring issues, or replacing the offending module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (battery replacement) - $500+ (diagnostics and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Dodge Challenger, while popular for its power and style, can present owners with a range of issues. The most concerning are engine problems such as cylinder head failure in the 3.6L V6 and potential supercharger issues in the Hellcat/Redeye models, which can be quite expensive to repair. Transmission issues, primarily rough shifting, are also a relatively common complaint. While less frequent, electrical issues like infotainment system malfunctions can be frustrating. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the possibility of costly repairs when considering a 2022 Challenger.
