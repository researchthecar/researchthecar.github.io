**Summary**

The 2010 Dodge Challenger has several potential issues that buyers should be aware of. Engine problems range from oil leaks and timing chain issues in the V6 to the "HEMI tick" and exhaust manifold bolt failures in the V8s. Electrical problems, particularly with the TIPM, can be significant and costly to repair. Suspension and interior issues, while less severe, can still be annoying. The estimated cost to fix these issues varies widely, from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to over $1500 for major engine or electrical work. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing problems.
