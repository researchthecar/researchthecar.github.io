The 2016 Dodge Challenger is a popular muscle car known for its aggressive styling and powerful engine options. The available engines for this year included a 3.6L Pentastar V6 (305 horsepower, 268 lb-ft of torque), a 5.7L Hemi V8 (375 horsepower, 410 lb-ft of torque), a 6.4L Hemi V8 (485 horsepower, 475 lb-ft of torque), and the supercharged 6.2L Hemi SRT Hellcat V8 (707 horsepower, 650 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a TorqueFlite 8-speed automatic and a Tremec 6-speed manual, depending on the engine. People generally love the Challenger's retro styling, powerful engine options, and spacious interior for a muscle car. Common complaints often revolve around its large size, somewhat cumbersome handling (especially on base models), and fuel economy, particularly with the V8 engines.

**Summary**

The 2016 Dodge Challenger, while a desirable muscle car, can have some notable issues. Engine problems range from relatively minor oil leaks to more serious concerns like valve spring failures in the 6.4L Hemi. The 8-speed automatic transmission can suffer from rough shifting. Electrical glitches, especially with the Uconnect system, are also common. Suspension noise and interior issues (sunroof, seat heaters) add to the list. The severity of these issues varies, and repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the problem. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used Challenger before purchasing.
