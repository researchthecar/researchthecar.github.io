### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Dodge Challenger, particularly with its V6 and standard V8 engines, demonstrates good overall reliability. The most frequently cited issues tend to be related to the automatic transmission's shifting behavior and potential oil or coolant leaks from the V6 engine. Higher-performance V8 models, while generally robust, can be more susceptible to issues related to their power output, such as cooling system demands. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the Uconnect infotainment system, are also noted. However, many of these issues are manageable with timely maintenance and diagnostics. The manual transmission and suspension systems are typically very reliable. Owners should be aware of potential oil leaks on the 3.6L and the possibility of lifter wear on the 5.7L HEMI.
