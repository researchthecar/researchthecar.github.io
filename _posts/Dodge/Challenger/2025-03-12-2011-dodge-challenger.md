The 2011 Dodge Challenger is a retro-styled muscle car that blends classic design with modern performance. Engine options for this year included the 3.6L Pentastar V6, the 5.7L Hemi V8, and the 6.4L Hemi V8. The 3.6L V6 produced around 305 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed automatic (with the V6) and either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual (with the V8 engines). Owners generally appreciate the Challenger's bold styling, comfortable ride, and powerful engine options. Common dislikes include its large size, limited visibility, and relatively poor fuel economy.
