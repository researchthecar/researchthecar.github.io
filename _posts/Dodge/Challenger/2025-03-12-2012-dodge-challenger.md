    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2012 Challengers with the 3.6L Pentastar V6 have experienced cylinder head failures, particularly on the left (driver's) side. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough idle, misfires (especially at idle), and ticking noises from the engine. This issue is often caused by overheating and valve seat problems.

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "Hemi Tick" is a common complaint on 5.7L Hemi engines. It sounds like a light, rhythmic ticking or tapping noise, often most noticeable at idle or low speeds. While not always indicative of a serious problem, it can be concerning. It is often caused by lifter issues or exhaust manifold leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial. Could require exhaust manifold replacement, lifter replacement, or valve train component replacement.

**Summary**

The 2012 Dodge Challenger, while generally a reliable vehicle, has some potential issues to be aware of.

Suspension noises and transmission issues can also occur, particularly at higher mileage. While the severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to major repairs, prospective buyers should carefully inspect any used Challenger and be prepared for potential maintenance costs.
