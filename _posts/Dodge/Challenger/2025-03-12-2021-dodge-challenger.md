The 2021 Dodge Challenger is a popular muscle car known for its retro styling, powerful engine options, and comfortable ride. It appeals to enthusiasts who appreciate its classic design and performance capabilities. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. Some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system, build quality, and occasional electrical glitches. The Challenger offers a range of engines, including the 3.6L Pentastar V6 (303 hp, 268 lb-ft torque), the 5.7L HEMI V8 (375 hp, 410 lb-ft torque), the 6.4L HEMI V8 (485 hp, 475 lb-ft torque), and the supercharged 6.2L HEMI V8 in various outputs (up to 807 hp, 707 lb-ft torque in the Hellcat Redeye). Transmission choices include a TorqueFlite 8-speed automatic and a Tremec 6-speed manual (depending on the engine). People generally love the Challenger for its looks and performance, but some dislike its size, fuel economy, and relatively dated interior.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Tick/Knock Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a ticking or knocking noise, especially at startup or idle. This can sometimes be attributed to the MultiAir actuator assembly. The cause can also be worn valve train components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician to determine the exact cause of the noise. This may require replacement of the MultiAir actuator assembly or worn valve train parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$2,000+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant and oil leaks from the plastic oil filter adapter/housing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter adapter/housing with a new, updated design (often an aluminum aftermarket replacement).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **HEMI Tick**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, especially at idle, from the top end. Often attributed to lifter failure.
    * Solution: Diagnostic inspection. Removal of the cylinder head and replacement of the lifters and possibly the camshaft if damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, often louder on cold starts, that eventually fades as the engine warms up. Caused by broken exhaust manifold bolts, leading to exhaust leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of broken exhaust manifold bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold if it is warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on the amount and location of the broken bolts
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.4L HEMI V8**

*   **HEMI Tick**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, especially at idle, from the top end. Often attributed to lifter failure.
    * Solution: Diagnostic inspection. Removal of the cylinder head and replacement of the lifters and possibly the camshaft if damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, often louder on cold starts, that eventually fades as the engine warms up. Caused by broken exhaust manifold bolts, leading to exhaust leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of broken exhaust manifold bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold if it is warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on the amount and location of the broken bolts
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Supercharged 6.2L HEMI V8**

*   **Supercharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises, loss of boost, or decreased performance. These issues can stem from the supercharger itself (rotor pack issues, bearing failures), the supercharger belt, or the intercooler system.
    *   Solution: Thorough inspection of the supercharger system, including the rotor pack, bearings, belt, and intercooler. Replacement of faulty components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$8,000+, depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqueFlite 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or harsh shifts, especially between lower gears. Hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating. Can be caused by valve body issues, worn solenoids, or software glitches.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and software update. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be necessary, potentially leading to valve body or solenoid replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (flush) - $2,000+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs rise without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This indicates that the transmission is failing to properly engage.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is required. Depending on severity, repairs can range from fluid changes and software updates to full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid changes) - $6,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Tremec 6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, or unusual noises when engaging the clutch.
    * Solution: Inspection of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. Replacement of worn components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system may freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often the first step. If the problem persists, the head unit might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with various sensors, such as the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), blind spot monitoring, or parking sensors. This can lead to warning lights and inaccurate readings.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor and replacement with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor depending on location and type

**Summary**

The 2021 Dodge Challenger, while a desirable vehicle for its style and performance, does have some potential issues owners should be aware of. Engine problems such as "HEMI tick", exhaust manifold bolt breakage, and oil filter housing leaks are prevalent. Transmission issues like harsh shifting, slippage, and clutch failure are also common, depending on the equipped transmission. Electrical issues like infotainment system problems and sensor malfunctions can also occur. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix (e.g., broken exhaust bolts or sensor replacement), others can be quite costly (e.g., engine or transmission rebuild/replacement).
