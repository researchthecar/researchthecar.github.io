Engine oil leaks can occur on the 5.7L HEMI, but are typically manageable repairs. The manual transmission and the standard chassis components are notably reliable. Overall, while not immune to problems, the Challenger's issues are often repairable and don't indicate systemic failures across the board, making it a reasonably dependable choice for muscle car enthusiasts, provided regular maintenance is performed.
