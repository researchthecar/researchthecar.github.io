Alright, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints related to the 2024 Dodge Hornet, categorized for clarity and accuracy, along with the requested formatting.

The 2024 Dodge Hornet marks Dodge's entry into the compact SUV segment. It offers two powertrain options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 268 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3L turbocharged inline-4 engine paired with an electric motor in the R/T plug-in hybrid model, delivering a combined 288 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Hornet's sporty styling and performance, especially the R/T's acceleration. Common dislikes include the infotainment system glitches, some cheap interior materials, and a relatively firm ride.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can cause rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light to illuminate. This can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause of the misfire and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component and shop labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.3L Turbocharged Inline-4 (Hybrid)**

*   **Reduced Electric Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the actual electric-only range is lower than the advertised range, especially in colder temperatures or with aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Unfortunately, this is largely inherent to hybrid/EV technology. Factors like driving style and temperature play a significant role. Ensuring proper tire inflation and minimizing accessory use can help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (characteristic of the vehicle operation)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, especially at lower speeds or during downshifts.
    *   Solution: A software update of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. If that doesn't work, a transmission fluid change or replacement of faulty solenoids might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the fix required
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (1.3L Turbocharged Inline-4 Hybrid)**

* No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system can freeze, become unresponsive, or exhibit lag.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates. A hard reset (disconnecting the battery for a few minutes) may temporarily resolve the issue. If persistent, the infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1000+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Connectivity Issues (Bluetooth/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent connectivity problems with Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay, or Android Auto. Devices may disconnect or fail to connect.
    *   Solution: Ensure phone is updated to the latest software version. Try a different cable (for CarPlay/Android Auto). Check for Uconnect software updates.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (troubleshooting) - $100 (new cable)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains rapidly, especially when the car is not in use. This can lead to starting issues.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested for proper function. A parasitic draw test can help identify if an electrical component is draining the battery while the vehicle is off. Address any identified parasitic draws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200+ (battery replacement) - $200-$500+ (parasitic draw diagnosis and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poorly Aligned Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported inconsistent panel gaps and misaligned body panels on their vehicles.
    *   Solution: Adjusting and realigning the body panels by a professional is the most common solution

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and tightening or padding the affected components. This may involve removing and reinstalling trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the severity and location of the rattle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

The 2024 Dodge Hornet, while appreciated for its sporty design and performance, does present some common issues. Electrical problems with the infotainment system are a frequent complaint. Engine and transmission issues seem to be present, but the electrical and interior issues are more prominent. The cost to fix these issues can range from minor software updates to more expensive component replacements, highlighting the importance of a thorough pre-purchase inspection and awareness of potential problems.
