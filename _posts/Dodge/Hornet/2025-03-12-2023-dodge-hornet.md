The 2023 Dodge Hornet marks Dodge's entry into the compact SUV segment. It comes with two powertrain options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 268 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission, and a 1.3L turbocharged inline-4 plug-in hybrid (PHEV) variant producing 288 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its sporty styling and performance, while others have expressed concerns about reliability and build quality. This information is based on owner reports, forums, and technical service bulletins.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls unexpectedly, particularly at low speeds or when idling. This can happen shortly after starting the vehicle or while driving.
    *   Solution: Software update to the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) to address fuel delivery or idle control issues. In more severe cases, inspection of the fuel pump and fuel injectors may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners are reporting high levels of oil consumption that can lead to low oil level lights and/or engine damage. Some owners state that their vehicles consume oil within a 1,000-mile oil change interval.
    * Solution: The oil drain plug should be checked for any leaks, as well as the oil filter. If no leaks are detected externally, consider checking the PCV valve system as a stuck open or closed PCV valve can increase oil consumption. The turbocharger's oil seals can also lead to oil consumption. Piston ring failure is another possible cause that would require an engine overhaul.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.3L Turbocharged Inline-4 (PHEV)**

*   **Check Engine Light with Multiple Codes**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminates with a variety of fault codes, often related to the hybrid system or engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis via OBD-II scanner to determine the specific fault codes. Repair may involve replacing faulty sensors, injectors, or addressing wiring harness issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (2.0L Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, especially between lower gears. Hesitation or delays when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Software update to the TCM (Transmission Control Module) to improve shift quality. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush or replacement of the valve body may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,500+

    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a diagnostic scanner to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the affected sensor and recalibration of the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery depletion, requiring frequent jump-starts.
