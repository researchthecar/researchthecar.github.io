The 2013 Dodge Dart was an attempt by Dodge to re-enter the compact car market. It offered a stylish exterior and a spacious interior, which were generally well-received. However, the Dart was plagued with reliability issues that ultimately hindered its success. Three engine options were available: a 2.0L Tigershark inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque, a 1.4L MultiAir turbocharged inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L Tigershark inline-4 producing 184 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic (DCT) which was paired with the 1.4L turbo engine. While some owners appreciated the Dart's styling and interior space, common complaints revolved around the car's performance, reliability, and the sometimes-clunky operation of the DCT.
