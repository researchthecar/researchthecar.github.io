### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Dodge Dart exhibits a reliability profile that is somewhat inconsistent, with particular attention needed for its powertrain options. The turbocharged 1.4L engine can be prone to turbocharger issues and oil leaks, while the larger Tigershark engines have reported oil consumption and coolant leak concerns. Transmissions, especially the dual-clutch automatic, have seen complaints of shuddering and control module failures. Electrical gremlins, such as Uconnect system glitches and battery drain, are also noted. While suspension components can wear, they are generally less problematic than the powertrain and electrical systems. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in possible repair costs when considering a used 2016 Dart.
