Here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2014 Dodge Dart, categorized by major components and broken down by engine and transmission options where applicable.

The 2014 Dodge Dart was Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (FCA) attempt to re-enter the compact car market. It was praised for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and available technology. However, it also faced criticism for its underwhelming engine performance (especially in the base models), reliability issues, and confusing trim level offerings. Engine options included a 2.0L Tigershark Inline-4 producing 160 hp and 148 lb-ft of torque, a 1.4L MultiAir Turbo Inline-4 producing 160 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L Tigershark Inline-4 producing 184 hp and 174 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic (for the 2.0L and 2.4L), and a 6-speed dual dry clutch transmission (DDCT) for the 1.4L Turbo.
