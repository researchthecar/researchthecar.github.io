### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Dodge Dart presents a mixed reliability profile. The naturally aspirated engines (2.0L and 2.4L) generally fare better than the 1.4L turbo, which can experience turbocharger issues and oil leaks. The DDCT automatic transmission is a notable weak point, with reports of harsh shifting and potential failure. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module and battery drain, are also a concern. While the suspension and exterior components are largely reliable, potential buyers should be aware of the powertrain and electrical system vulnerabilities. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these issues.
