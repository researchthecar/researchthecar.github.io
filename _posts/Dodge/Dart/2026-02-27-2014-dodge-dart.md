### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Dodge Dart's reliability is a point of concern, particularly for models equipped with the 1.4L turbo engine and the dual-clutch automatic transmission. These powertrains are more prone to issues like turbocharger failure, oil leaks, and transmission shuddering or outright failure. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or the Uconnect infotainment system, also appear with some regularity. While the naturally aspirated engines and the conventional automatic transmission generally fare better, and the chassis and interior are relatively robust, potential buyers should be aware of these common problem areas. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and consideration of extended warranties are advisable for this model year.
