### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Dodge Dart presents a mixed reliability picture. The 1.4L Turbo engine and the DDCT automatic transmission are the most frequent sources of significant mechanical issues, with turbocharger problems, oil leaks, and transmission shuddering being common complaints. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and Uconnect system, also add to the potential repair list. While the 2.0L and 2.4L engines and the conventional automatic transmission appear more robust, and the suspension and exterior/interior generally hold up well, the powertrain and electrical concerns warrant careful consideration. Buyers should prioritize vehicles with well-documented maintenance history and be prepared for potential repairs, especially if opting for the turbocharged engine or dual-clutch transmission.
