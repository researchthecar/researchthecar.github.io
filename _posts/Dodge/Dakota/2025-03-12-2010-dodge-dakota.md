The 2010 Dodge Dakota is a mid-size pickup truck that offers a blend of utility and comfort. For 2010, it came with three engine options: a 2.5L inline-4, a 3.7L V6, and a 4.7L V8. The 2.5L I4 produces 177 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque. The 3.7L V6 engine makes 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. The 4.7L V8 engine produces 302 horsepower and 329 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic (with the 2.5L and 3.7L) and a 5-speed automatic (with the 4.7L). Owners often appreciate the Dakota's maneuverability compared to full-size trucks and its relatively spacious cabin. However, some common complaints include lower fuel economy than some competitors and interior plastics that feel cheap. The 2.5L engine was only available on Regular cab models.
