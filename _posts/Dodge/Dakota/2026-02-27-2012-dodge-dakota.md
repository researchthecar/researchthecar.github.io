### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Dodge Dakota presents a mixed reliability profile. While its V6 and V8 engines are generally robust, specific issues like oil leaks on the 3.7L and head gasket concerns on the 4.7L can arise. The 5.7L HEMI's cylinder deactivation system is a known point of potential failure. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 42RLE, can experience slipping and overheating, often requiring significant repair. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, as expected for a truck. Electrical issues, such as power window motors and alternators, are also documented. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor can fail. Overall, proactive maintenance, especially regarding fluid changes and addressing early signs of leaks or performance issues, is crucial for maximizing the lifespan and reliability of a 2012 Dodge Dakota.
