The 2012 Dodge Dakota marked the final year of production for this mid-size pickup truck. It offered a blend of utility and practicality, appealing to those who needed a capable vehicle smaller than a full-size truck. The Dakota was available with two engine options: a 2.5L Inline-4 producing 177 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.7L V6 generating 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were generally paired with either a 4-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission depending on the configuration. Owners often praised the Dakota's manageable size, decent towing capacity, and rugged styling. However, some common complaints included its relatively poor fuel economy compared to newer trucks, dated interior, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**
The 2012 Dodge Dakota, while a versatile mid-size truck, can be susceptible to some common issues. Engine oil leaks and crankshaft position sensor failures in the 3.7L V6 are fairly common. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, can range from minor shifting problems to major failures. Suspension component wear and rust are also concerns. Electrical problems and interior issues can also occur. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. Buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these problems before purchasing.
