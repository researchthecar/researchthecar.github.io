The automatic transmissions, especially the 42RLE, can experience torque converter and solenoid problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster and window motor failures, are also reported. Rust can be a concern on the frame and body. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the Dakota to be a durable truck when properly maintained. Proactive attention to cooling systems, regular oil changes, and addressing suspension noises promptly can mitigate many common problems.
