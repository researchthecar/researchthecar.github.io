The 2007 Dodge Dakota is a mid-size pickup truck that offers a blend of utility and comfort. Engine options for this model year include a 2.5L Inline-4 (I4), a 3.7L V6, and a 4.7L V8. The 3.7L V6 produces around 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, making it a popular choice for its balance of power and fuel economy. Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic, a 5-speed manual, and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Dakota's rugged styling, decent towing capacity, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints revolve around fuel economy, the quality of some interior materials, and some specific mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may exhibit a rough idle, stall intermittently, or hesitate during acceleration. This can be more pronounced when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve, cleaning the throttle body, or replacing faulty engine sensors (such as the mass airflow sensor or oxygen sensors) can resolve this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises coming from the front of the engine, especially during cold starts. This can indicate wear or stretching of the timing chain and/or issues with the timing chain tensioner.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.7L V8**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4.7L V8 is known to be prone to sludge buildup, especially if oil changes are not performed regularly or if low-quality oil is used. This can lead to reduced oil pressure, engine knocking, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and a good quality filter. In severe cases, engine flushing or internal cleaning may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for oil change and flush; $500 - $2000+ for more extensive internal cleaning or engine rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Train Noise/Lifter Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or tapping noises coming from the top of the engine. This can be caused by worn lifters, rocker arms, or valves.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected lifters, rocker arms, or valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or harsh shifts between gears, particularly between 1st and 2nd or 2nd and 3rd. This can also be accompanied by a clunking noise.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission solenoid pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping/Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip, especially under load, or exhibit erratic shifting patterns. This can be caused by worn clutch packs or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body or performing a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ for valve body; $2000 - $4000+ for transmission rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the ball joints, particularly the lower ball joints. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected ball joints. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps. This is often due to worn or broken sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replacing the sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per link.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to control the temperature of the air coming from the vents. One side might blow hot while the other blows cold, or the temperature may not change at all. This is often caused by a faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster, including gauges and displays. This can be caused by faulty wiring or a failing instrument cluster module.
    *   Solution: Repairing faulty wiring or replacing the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Wells/Fenders**

**Summary:**

The 2007 Dodge Dakota has some common issues, varying in severity and cost. Engine issues like sludge buildup in the 4.7L V8 and timing chain problems in the 3.7L V6 can be costly if neglected. Transmission problems, particularly with the 4-speed and 5-speed automatic options, can also lead to expensive repairs. Suspension issues, while less severe, contribute to overall maintenance costs. Electrical problems like blend door actuator failure are relatively common and less expensive to fix. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor them into their purchasing and maintenance budget.
