The 2004 Dodge Dakota is a mid-size pickup truck known for its ruggedness and relatively compact size compared to full-size trucks. Engine options included a 2.5L Inline-4 (I4), a 3.7L PowerTech V6, and a 4.7L Magnum V8. The 3.7L V6 produced around 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Many owners appreciate the Dakota's maneuverability, towing capacity for its size, and relatively affordable price point. Common dislikes include the fuel economy, some reliability issues, and the interior materials which were not as refined as some competitors.
