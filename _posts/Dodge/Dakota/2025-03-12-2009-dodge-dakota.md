The 2009 Dodge Dakota is a mid-size pickup truck that offers a blend of utility and comfort. For the 2009 model year, engine options included a 210 horsepower 3.7L V6 engine producing 235 lb-ft of torque, a 290 horsepower 4.7L V8 engine producing 320 lb-ft of torque, and a 302 horsepower 5.7L V8 engine producing 329 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices varied depending on the engine but primarily included a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Dakota's rugged styling, decent towing capacity, and maneuverability compared to full-size trucks. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, some reliability issues, and the aging design.

**Summary**

The 2009 Dodge Dakota can be a useful and versatile truck, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 4.7L V8 engine can be prone to exhaust manifold issues and engine misfires, while both automatic transmissions can suffer from harsh shifting or torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins with the TIPM can be frustrating. Rust is another concern to watch out for, especially in areas with harsh winters. The cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the issue, but some, like TIPM replacement or rust repair, can be quite expensive. Thoroughly inspecting a potential purchase and obtaining a pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended.
