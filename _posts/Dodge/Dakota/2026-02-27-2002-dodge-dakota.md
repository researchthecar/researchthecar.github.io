### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Dodge Dakota presents a mixed reliability profile. The engines, particularly the V8 options, can be prone to specific issues like spark plug blow-out or intake manifold leaks, while the 4-cylinder may suffer from head gasket problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the 42RE, have documented issues with torque converters and solenoids. Manual transmissions are generally more robust but subject to standard clutch wear. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster and window motor failures, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, while not without its flaws, many issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs. Owners should be aware of these common problems when considering or maintaining a 2002 Dakota.
