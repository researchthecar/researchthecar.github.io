**Introduction**

The 1991 Dodge Dakota is a compact pickup truck that offers a range of engine and transmission options. It is known for its rugged construction and off-road capabilities. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues.

The Dakota is available with a variety of engine options, including a 2.5L inline-4, a 3.9L V6, and a 5.2L V8. The 2.5L inline-4 produces 110 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.9L V6 produces 175 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. The 5.2L V8 produces 230 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque.

The Dakota is also available with a choice of either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 5-speed manual transmission is known for its durability and reliability, while the 4-speed automatic transmission is smoother and more efficient.
