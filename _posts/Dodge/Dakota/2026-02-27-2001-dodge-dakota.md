### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Dodge Dakota presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly head gasket failures on the 2.5L, intake manifold leaks on the 3.9L, and spark plug blowout on the 4.7L V8. Transmission issues, especially with the 42RE automatic, can also arise. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear. Electrical problems, such as instrument cluster and alternator failures, are not uncommon. Exterior rust, particularly on frame rails and wheel wells, is a significant concern for vehicles in rust-prone areas. Interior wear and HVAC blend door issues are also reported. Despite these potential problems, many Dakotas have proven durable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
