The 2011 Dodge Dakota was the last model year for this mid-size pickup truck, offering a blend of utility and maneuverability. Two engine options were available: a 2.5L I4 engine with 177 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.7L V8 engine producing 302 horsepower and 329 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L I4 was offered with a 5-speed manual transmission only, while the 4.7L V8 came with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Dakota's compact size compared to full-size trucks, making it easier to park and maneuver in urban environments. However, some criticisms included the Dakota's lower fuel economy compared to other trucks of similar size, as well as the aging interior design.

**Summary**

The 2011 Dodge Dakota, while generally a reliable truck, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The exhaust manifold bolts on the 4.7L V8, torque converter in the 5-speed automatic transmission, front ball joints, and TIPM module are all potential problem areas. Rust can also be a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. The severity and cost of these repairs can vary depending on the vehicle's condition and location.
