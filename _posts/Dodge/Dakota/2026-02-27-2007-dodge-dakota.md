### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Dodge Dakota presents a mixed reliability profile. The V8 engines, particularly the 5.7L HEMI, are generally robust but can experience issues related to the Multi-Displacement System and oil cooler lines. The 3.7L V6 is prone to intake manifold leaks. Transmission issues, especially with the 42RLE automatic, include slipping and overheating, while manual transmissions may face clutch wear. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can require attention. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior wear on seats and HVAC blend doors are common. Overall, while not without its flaws, many issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
