The 2001 Dodge Ram 2500 Van is a full-size van known for its utility and relatively simple mechanical design. It was offered with several engine options: a 3.9L V6, a 5.2L V8, and a 5.9L V8. The 5.2L Magnum V8 produced around 230 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically included a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the van's spaciousness, cargo capacity, and relatively easy maintenance. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, ride quality, and some of the age-related issues inherent in older vehicles.

**Summary**

The 2001 Dodge Ram 2500 Van, while reliable for its time, suffers from issues typical of older vehicles. Engine issues are often related to exhaust manifolds and the PCM. Transmission problems, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, can be expensive to address. Suspension wear is common, as is electrical system corrosion. Body rust is also a significant concern. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand for extensive transmission or rust repair.
