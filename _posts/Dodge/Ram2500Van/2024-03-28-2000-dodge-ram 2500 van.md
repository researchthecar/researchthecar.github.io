**Introduction:**

The 2000 Dodge Ram 2500 Van was a full-size cargo van offered with the following engine and transmission options:

* **5.2L Magnum V8** (230 hp, 315 lb-ft torque) with 4-speed automatic transmission
* **5.9L Magnum V8** (245 hp, 335 lb-ft torque) with 4-speed automatic transmission or 6-speed manual transmission

Known for its spacious cargo area and powerful engines, the Ram 2500 Van also had its share of common problems.

**Engine**

**5.2L Magnum V8**

* **Intake manifold plenum failure:** The intake manifold plenum gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak and reduced engine power. Symptoms include rough idling, stalling, and check engine light illumination. Solution: Replace the intake manifold plenum gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**4-speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Overdrive gear failure:** The overdrive gear can fail prematurely, leading to transmission slipping and difficulty shifting gears. Symptoms include slipping gears, delayed engagement, and check engine light illumination. Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Suspension**

* **Leaf spring failure:** The rear leaf springs can sag or break, causing the rear end to sag and affect handling. Symptoms include excessive body roll, uneven ride height, and clunking noises. Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

* **Ball joint failure:** The ball joints can wear out or fail, causing a loss of steering stability and premature tire wear. Symptoms include clunking noises, loose steering, and uneven tire wear. Solution: Replace the ball joints. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** The battery can drain prematurely due to a faulty starter solenoid or alternator. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle, dim headlights, and flickering interior lights. Solution: Replace the starter solenoid or alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail to provide sufficient electrical power to the vehicle's systems. Symptoms include flickering lights, battery drain, and reduced engine power. Solution: Replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+

**Exterior**

* **Rear door rust:** The rear door panels can rust premature due to poor drainage and lack of proper sealing. Symptoms include rust spots, holes, and water leaks. Solution: Rust repair or door panel replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

**Interior**

* **HVAC blower motor failure:** The blower motor can fail to provide adequate airflow or stop working completely. Symptoms include no airflow, reduced airflow, or strange noises coming from the HVAC system. Solution: Replace the blower motor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

* **Power window failure:** The power window motors can fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. Symptoms include difficulty raising or lowering windows and clicking noises. Solution: Replace the power window motors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Summary:**

The 2000 Dodge Ram 2500 Van had a combination of common and severe issues within the engine, transmission, and suspension systems. Engine intake manifold and transmission overdrive gear failures were particularly costly to fix. Electrical problems with the battery and alternator also caused frequent issues for owners.
