The 2003 Dodge Ram 2500 Van is a full-size work van known for its durability and utilitarian design. It was available with several engine options, including the 3.9L V6 (around 175 hp and 225 lb-ft of torque), the 5.2L V8 (around 230 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque), and the 5.9L V8 (around 245 hp and 335 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were typically either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual, depending on the engine. Owners appreciate the van's cargo capacity and straightforward mechanics, making it relatively easy to repair. However, common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy, rust issues, and the age-related problems that affect many vehicles of this era.
