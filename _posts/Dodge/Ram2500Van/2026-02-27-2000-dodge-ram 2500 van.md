### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Dodge Ram 2500 Van is a capable vehicle, but its age means certain components are prone to failure. The gasoline V8 engines can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and, less commonly, cracked cylinder heads. The 5.9L Cummins diesel is generally robust but can experience injection pump or head gasket issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 47RE, may develop torque converter problems or overheat. Manual transmissions are more reliable but can have synchronizer issues. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items. Electrical issues often stem from aging wiring harnesses. Exterior rust is a significant concern for vehicles in corrosive environments. Interior climate control systems, specifically blower motors and blend doors, are also known to fail. Regular maintenance and proactive attention to these known issues are crucial for maintaining the reliability of these work vans.
