The 2010 Dodge Ram 3500 is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options included a 5.7L Hemi V8, a 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6, and a 4.7L V8 (although less common). The 6.7L Cummins produced 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque, making it a popular choice for those needing serious work capabilities. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Ram 3500 for its robust engine options and towing prowess. However, common complaints revolve around electrical issues, suspension problems (especially with age), and potential issues with the diesel engine's emissions systems.

**Engine**

**5.7L Hemi V8**
* **"Hemi Tick" / Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, especially on cold starts, often attributed to broken exhaust manifold bolts or worn lifters. The ticking is due to exhaust leaks around the broken bolts.
    * Solution: Replace broken exhaust manifold bolts or the entire exhaust manifold. In some cases, the lifters may need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the extent of the repair (manifold vs. bolts only, and labor rates)
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6**
* **EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) Valve Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clogged or malfunctioning EGR valve can cause rough idling, reduced fuel economy, and the check engine light to illuminate.
    * Solution: Replace the EGR valve. Cleaning *may* work temporarily but replacement is generally more reliable.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, especially with frequent short trips. This can lead to reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, and potential engine damage. Regeneration cycles may also fail.
    * Solution: Force a regeneration cycle (if possible), clean the DPF, or replace the DPF.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (cleaning) - $2000+ (DPF replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, unusual noises from the turbocharger (whining or screeching).
    * Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (68RFE)**

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Can also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Slipping and Hard Shifts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement of gears, slipping between gears, or harsh shifting. This can be caused by worn clutches or valve body issues.
    * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. A valve body replacement *may* address the problem in some cases, but a full rebuild is often necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (valve body) - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Ball Joint Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Front-end clunking noises, uneven tire wear, and loose steering. Particularly common on trucks that are used for heavy hauling or off-roading.
    * Solution: Replace the ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Worn Leaf Springs**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, especially when loaded. Can also lead to a rougher ride.
    * Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A wide range of electrical problems, including stalling, no-start conditions, intermittent lighting issues, and malfunctioning power windows or locks. This module controls many of the vehicle's electrical functions.
    * Solution: Replace the TIPM.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Corrosion or damage to wiring harnesses, particularly in areas exposed to the elements. Can cause a variety of electrical malfunctions.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the affected wiring harness sections.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the repair
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Bed Rail Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming along the bed rails, especially in areas where the bed liner or tonneau cover rubs against the metal.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the affected sections of the bed rail.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Wheel Well Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming around the wheel wells and fender flares

**Summary**

The 2010 Dodge Ram 3500 is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues, especially as the vehicles age. The 6.7L Cummins diesel engine, while powerful, can suffer from EGR, DPF, and turbocharger problems. Electrical issues, particularly related to the TIPM, are also common and can be costly to repair. Suspension components, especially ball joints and leaf springs, may require replacement due to wear and tear. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds or DPF replacement, can be significant expenses. Careful inspection and preventative maintenance are crucial for keeping a 2010 Ram 3500 in good working order.
