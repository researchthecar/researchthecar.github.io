**Engine**

**5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel**

*   **Lift Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The lift pump, responsible for supplying fuel to the high-pressure injection pump (VP44), is prone to failure. Symptoms include hard starting, loss of power, and eventual failure of the VP44 injection pump due to fuel starvation.
    *   Solution: Replace the lift pump with an upgraded aftermarket pump that provides better fuel flow and reliability. Relocate the lift pump closer to the fuel tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VP44 Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VP44 is an electronically controlled rotary injection pump. It is sensitive to fuel pressure and quality. When the lift pump fails, or fuel isnâ€™t properly filtered, the VP44 can fail. Symptoms include hard starting, rough idling, loss of power, and stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the VP44 injection pump. Install a fuel pressure gauge to monitor fuel pressure and prevent future failures. Ensure fuel is properly filtered.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
