### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Dodge Ram 3500, particularly with the 5.9L Cummins diesel, is a capable truck with a reputation for durability. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the VP44 injection pump and the possibility of cracked cylinder heads on the diesel. Automatic transmission issues, especially with the 47RE, can be costly. Manual transmissions are generally more robust but can suffer from 3rd gear problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, as is common in heavy-duty trucks. Electrical gremlins and rust are also points to inspect. Despite these potential drawbacks, with proper maintenance and addressing known issues, the 2000 Ram 3500 can remain a reliable vehicle for demanding tasks.
