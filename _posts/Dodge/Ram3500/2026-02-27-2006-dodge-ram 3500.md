### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Dodge Ram 3500, particularly with the 5.9L Cummins diesel, is a workhorse with a reputation for durability. However, common issues like injector and injection pump failures on the diesel, and lifter/camshaft wear on the HEMI V8, require attention. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic 48RE, and suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also areas to monitor. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the instrument cluster and BCM, can arise. Rust is a concern for older models. Despite these potential problems, addressing them proactively can maintain the Ram 3500's capability.
