**Summary**

The 2002 Dodge Ram 3500, while a capable truck, is prone to several issues stemming from its age and design. The Cummins diesel engine, although robust, can suffer from lift pump and VP44 injection pump failures, as well as the infamous "Killer Dowel Pin" issue. The 47RE automatic transmission is known for overdrive problems and torque converter issues, while the NV4500 manual can experience 5th gear nut failure. Suspension components like ball joints and steering linkage are also common wear items. Electrical gremlins can manifest as instrument cluster failures. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in the cost of repairs and preventative maintenance. The severity and cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls.
