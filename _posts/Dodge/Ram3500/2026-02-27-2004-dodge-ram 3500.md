### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Dodge Ram 3500, particularly with the 5.9L Cummins diesel engine, is a capable truck but exhibits some common issues typical for its age and heavy-duty nature. The diesel engine's fuel system (injectors and pump) and the automatic transmission (especially the 48RE) are areas that may require attention. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can also wear out. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster problems and alternator failures, are not uncommon. Rust can be a concern depending on the climate. Overall, while not without its potential problems, many of these are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, making it a viable option for those seeking a robust work truck.
