**Summary**

The 2001 Dodge Ram 3500, while a capable and durable truck, is prone to several age-related issues. The most serious and costly problems tend to revolve around the Cummins diesel engine's fuel delivery system (lift pump and VP44 injection pump) and the automatic transmissions, particularly the overdrive unit on the 47RE and general wear in the 46RE. Rust is a significant concern in certain climates. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs also require attention due to wear. While maintenance can be costly, particularly on the diesel models, addressing these issues proactively can keep these workhorses on the road.
