Owners often praise the Ram 3500 for its powerful diesel engines, solid axles, comfortable ride (for a heavy-duty truck), and rugged styling. Common complaints include fuel economy (especially with the gas engine), some reliability issues (depending on engine and model year), and interior plastics that can feel cheap.

**Engine**

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or tapping sound emanating from the engine, often more pronounced when cold. This can be caused by a number of parts, the most common are faulty exhaust manifold bolts or worn rocker arms/lifters.
    *   Solution: Replace exhaust manifold bolts or replace worn rocker arms and lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for exhaust manifold bolts, $1500 - $3000+ for rocker arms/lifters.

**5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel**

No Issues Found

**6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR cooler can crack or leak, leading to coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, loud whistling or grinding noises from the turbocharger area. This is usually caused by oil starvation or overspeeding the turbo.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (5.7L Hemi)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, especially during light acceleration or when the torque converter is locking up. This can be caused by a failing torque converter or contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Flush the transmission fluid and replace it with fresh fluid and filter, or replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 for fluid/filter change, $800 - $1500+ for torque converter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual (Diesel)**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, grinding noises, or a complete inability to engage gears. This is a common issue with heavy-duty trucks that are used for towing and hauling.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Diesel)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. The valve body controls the flow of hydraulic fluid within the transmission, and if it malfunctions, it can cause a variety of problems.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, clunking noises from the front end, uneven tire wear. Ball joints are a critical component of the front suspension, and they can wear out over time, especially on heavy-duty trucks.
    *   Solution: Replace the ball joints. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs (both upper or both lower) to ensure even wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Track Bar Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Wandering steering, "death wobble" (violent shaking of the front end), clunking noises. The track bar locates the front axle and prevents lateral movement. Worn bushings or a loose track bar can cause these issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the track bar and/or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Dodge Ram 3500 is a capable heavy-duty truck, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The 6.7L Cummins diesel can experience EGR cooler and turbocharger problems, while the 5.7L Hemi may suffer from the "Hemi Tick." Transmission issues can vary depending on the chosen transmission. Suspension components like ball joints and the track bar are prone to wear. Electrical problems, particularly related to the TIPM, are also a possibility. Rust on the body panels and dashboard cracking are common cosmetic concerns. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, with some repairs costing several thousand dollars. A thorough inspection before purchase is highly recommended.
