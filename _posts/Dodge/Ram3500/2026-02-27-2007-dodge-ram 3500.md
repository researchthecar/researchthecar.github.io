### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Dodge Ram 3500, particularly with the Cummins diesel engines, is a robust truck but can experience specific issues related to its powertrain and emissions systems. The 5.9L Cummins is generally well-regarded, but injector and turbo issues can arise. The 6.7L Cummins, while more powerful, introduced DPF and EGR complexities that require attention. Automatic transmissions, especially the 68RFE, may need torque converter service. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear due to the truck's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are not uncommon. Owners should be mindful of potential rust, especially in corrosive climates, and interior wear. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing these known issues, the 2007 Ram 3500 can remain a reliable heavy-duty vehicle.
