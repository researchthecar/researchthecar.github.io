The Ram 3500 is praised for its powerful engines, sturdy build quality, and spacious interior. However, it has also been reported to have some common issues.

**Engine**

**5.7L Hemi V8**

* **Cylinder Head Failure:** This issue affects pre-2008 models and is characterized by coolant leaks, overheating, and a loss of power. The cylinder heads may crack or warp, requiring replacement. **$1,500 - $3,000+**
* **Lifter Ticking:** A common problem that manifests as a loud ticking noise from the engine. It is caused by worn or damaged lifters. Replacing the lifters usually resolves the issue. **$500 - $1,000**
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** This gasket can fail, causing vacuum leaks and decreased engine performance. Replacing the gasket is the solution. **$300 - $600**

**6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6**

* **Fuel Injector Failure:** Failed fuel injectors can cause rough idling, poor fuel economy, and engine misfires. Replacing the injectors is necessary. **$1,000 - $2,000+**
* **Turbocharger Failure:** Turbocharger failure can lead to reduced power output, smoke from the exhaust, and increased engine noise. Replacing the turbocharger is the solution. **$2,000 - $4,000+**
* **EGR Cooler Failure:** The EGR cooler can fail, causing coolant leaks and reduced engine performance. Replacing the cooler is the solution. **$1,000 - $2,000**

**5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6**

* **Injection Pump Failure:** The injection pump can fail, causing engine stalling, difficulty starting, and a loss of power. Replacing the injection pump is necessary. **$2,000 - $4,000+**
* **Head Gasket Failure:** This issue is more common in pre-2004 models and is characterized by coolant leaks and overheating. The head gasket needs to be replaced. **$1,500 - $3,000+**
* **Transmission Control Module Failure:** The transmission control module can fail, leading to transmission problems such as shifting difficulties and loss of gears. Replacing the module is the solution. **$800 - $1,500**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (45RFE)**

* **Overheating:** The transmission can overheat, causing slipping, shuddering, and premature failure. A transmission cooler may be added to resolve the issue. **$500 - $1,000**
* **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter can fail, leading to slipping, shuddering, and loss of transmission power. Replacing the torque converter is the solution. **$1,000 - $2,000+**
