### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Dodge Ram 3500, particularly with the 6.7L Cummins diesel engine, is generally a robust truck, but it is not without its potential issues. Common problems revolve around the EGR cooler, turbocharger, and fuel injectors for the diesel, while the gasoline HEMI can experience 'Hemi tick' and oil consumption. Automatic transmission issues like torque converter shudder and overheating are noted for the 68RFE, and manual transmissions can face clutch wear. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are typical wear items for heavy-duty trucks. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are also possible. Overall, while capable, owners should be aware of these potential repair areas and budget accordingly for maintenance and unexpected repairs.
