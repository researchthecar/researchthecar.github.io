### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Dodge Verna, while an economical choice, exhibits common issues for its age and class. Engine oil leaks and cooling system problems are notable, as is the potential for timing belt issues on the 1.6L engine if not maintained. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic, can lead to costly repairs. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are prone to wear, and electrical gremlins, especially related to wiring harness corrosion and alternator failure, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on climate. Interior issues often center around the HVAC blower motor and dashboard lighting. Regular inspections and proactive maintenance, especially concerning the timing belt and fluid changes, are crucial for mitigating these potential reliability concerns.
