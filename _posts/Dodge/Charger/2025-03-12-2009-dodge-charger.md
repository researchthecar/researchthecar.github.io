The 2009 Dodge Charger is a full-size sedan known for its bold styling, comfortable ride, and available powerful engines. Engine options included a 2.7L V6 (178 hp, 190 lb-ft), a 3.5L V6 (250 hp, 250 lb-ft), a 5.7L Hemi V8 (368 hp, 395 lb-ft), and a 6.1L Hemi V8 (425 hp, 420 lb-ft) found in the SRT8 model. The transmissions paired with these engines were primarily a 4-speed automatic for the 2.7L and 3.5L, and a 5-speed automatic for the 5.7L and 6.1L. Owners appreciate the Charger's spacious interior, muscular appearance, and strong performance, particularly with the V8 engines. Common complaints include fuel economy, some reliability concerns, and the age of the vehicle leading to more frequent maintenance.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Engine Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 engine is prone to oil sludge buildup if oil changes are not performed regularly. This can lead to reduced oil flow, overheating, and ultimately, engine failure. Symptoms include a ticking noise from the engine, decreased performance, and the oil light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil are crucial. In severe cases, the engine may need to be disassembled and cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.5L V6 engine can experience timing chain issues, leading to poor performance, rough idling, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking sound, especially at idle, emanating from the engine. This is often attributed to the lifters. While it doesn't always cause immediate engine failure, it is a sign of wear and potential issue with the valve train.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lifters and potentially the camshaft.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.1L Hemi V8**
*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (2.7L, 3.5L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can experience harsh or erratic shifting, especially between gears. This can be caused by worn solenoids or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the solenoids, valve body, or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (5.7L, 6.1L)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can manifest as shuddering during acceleration, poor fuel economy, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the control arm bushings, particularly in the front suspension. Symptoms include clunking noises during bumps, wandering steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM can cause various electrical problems, including fuel pump relay failure (leading to stalling or no-start conditions), issues with power windows, door locks, and lights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: 14V530000

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator may fail prematurely, causing the battery to drain and potentially leaving the vehicle unable to start. Symptoms include dimming lights, a battery warning light, and difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower body panels, particularly around the wheel wells and rocker panels, especially in areas with harsh winter conditions (road salt).
    *   Solution: Repairing and repainting the affected areas, or replacing the rusted panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**

    *   Solution: Cleaning the sunroof drains and/or replacing the sunroof seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2009 Dodge Charger can be a fun and stylish vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The engine and electrical systems seem to be where the majority of problems occur, particularly with the TIPM and potential for sludge buildup in the 2.7L V6. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also common failure points due to age and wear. Repair costs can vary widely, but addressing these potential issues proactively can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
