Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy (especially with the V8 engines), some interior material quality issues, and reports of electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant and/or oil leaking from the oil filter housing. This can lead to low oil pressure, overheating, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil filter housing with an updated design to prevent future leaks. Some aftermarket options are made out of metal instead of plastic for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light may illuminate. Diagnostic codes may indicate misfires in specific cylinders. Faulty ignition coils and bad spark plugs are usually the culprit.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils and spark plugs. Inspect wiring and connectors for damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or tapping noise, typically noticeable at idle or low speeds. While not always indicative of a major problem, it can be caused by exhaust manifold bolts breaking.
    *   Solution: Replace broken exhaust manifold bolts. In some cases, the exhaust manifold itself may need to be replaced if warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Louder ticking or knocking noise, rough running engine, and potential loss of power. Can be caused by a faulty lifter.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty lifter or lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000-$2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.4L Hemi V8**
* **Piston Ring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blue smoke coming out of the exhaust, excessive oil consumption. Can be caused by failure of the piston rings.
    *   Solution: Replace piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000-$6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (5.7L Hemi V8)**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficultly getting out of park, shifter being loose, or shifter feeling clunky.
    *   Solution: Replace shifter assembly
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (3.6L Pentastar V6 and 6.4L Hemi V8)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Some cases can be resolved with a software update/reflash of the transmission control module (TCM). However, if the issue persists, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and required solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Squeaks/Creaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or creaking noises coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: This is often caused by worn-out sway bar bushings or ball joints. Replacement of the affected components will resolve the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A wide range of electrical problems, including stalling, failure to start, fuel pump issues, and intermittent operation of various accessories (windows, lights, etc.). The TIPM is essentially the car's central electrical hub.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM is often the only solution. Some shops specialize in repairing TIPMs, which can be a more cost-effective alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
    *   Note: While no direct recall exists for the TIPM in the 2012 Charger, similar issues in other Chrysler vehicles have led to recalls and class-action lawsuits.

*   **Radio/Uconnect System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Try a software update. If that doesn't resolve the issue, the radio unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing, reducing light output and potentially damaging the headlight assembly.
    *   Solution: Some owners drill small drain holes in the bottom of the headlight housing to allow moisture to escape. Replacement of the headlight assembly is the more permanent solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5 - $500+ (depending on the solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters not working or only working intermittently.
    *   Solution: Check the wiring and connections to the seat heater elements. If the elements are faulty, they will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: There is no real "fix" besides replacing the dashboard, which is costly. Using a dashboard cover can help prevent further cracking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Dodge Charger has a mix of potential issues that owners should be aware of. Electrical problems related to the TIPM can be quite severe and costly to address. Engine issues, particularly with the 3.6L V6 and 5.7L V8, can also lead to significant repair bills. While some problems, like suspension noises, are relatively minor, others, such as transmission issues, can be more serious. Overall, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
