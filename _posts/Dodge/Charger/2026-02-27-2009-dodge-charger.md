### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Dodge Charger presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core structure and many components are robust, specific powertrain and electrical systems have documented issues. The 3.5L V6 and 5.7L HEMI V8 engines can experience coolant leaks and oil cooler line problems, with the HEMI also susceptible to MDS-related faults. The 5-speed automatic transmission may develop shifting problems or torque converter issues. Electrically, window regulators and the TIPM module are known failure points. The SRT8's 6.1L HEMI and the exterior/interior components generally fare better with fewer widespread complaints. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating potential repair costs and ensuring long-term reliability.
