The 2013 Dodge Charger is a full-size sedan known for its muscular styling, comfortable ride, and available performance options. Engine choices included the 3.6L Pentastar V6 (292 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque in standard form, and 300 hp, 264 lb-ft of torque in Rallye trim), the 5.7L HEMI V8 (370 hp, 395 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.4L HEMI V8 (470 hp, 470 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, except for some base V6 models, which came with a 5-speed automatic. People often appreciate the Charger's spacious interior, powerful engine options, and aggressive looks. Common dislikes include its large size, which can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and the fuel economy of the V8 engines.

The 2013 Dodge Charger can be a rewarding vehicle to own, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The TIPM issues are widespread and can cause a variety of frustrating electrical problems. Engine issues, especially with the 3.6L V6, can also be a concern. Suspension issues are fairly standard for a vehicle of this age and mileage. The cracking dashboard is a cosmetic issue but a common complaint that can significantly affect the vehicle's appearance and value. Repair costs vary, but the TIPM and dashboard repairs can be quite expensive.
