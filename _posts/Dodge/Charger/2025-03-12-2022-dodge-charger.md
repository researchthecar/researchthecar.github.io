The 2022 Dodge Charger is a full-size sedan known for its aggressive styling, powerful engine options, and spacious interior. The available engines range from the entry-level 3.6L Pentastar V6 (292-300 hp, 260-264 lb-ft of torque) to the monstrous supercharged 6.2L Hemi Hellcat V8 (717-797 hp, 650-707 lb-ft of torque). Other engine options include a 5.7L Hemi V8 (370 hp, 395 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.4L Hemi V8 (485 hp, 475 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the Charger's powerful engine options, comfortable ride, and retro-inspired design. Common dislikes include its large size, relatively poor fuel economy (especially with the V8 engines), and dated interior design.
