Alright, here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2018 Dodge Charger, categorized as requested.

The 2018 Dodge Charger is a popular full-size sedan known for its aggressive styling, spacious interior, and powerful engine options. Engine choices include the 3.6L Pentastar V6 (around 292-300 hp and 260-264 lb-ft of torque depending on trim), the 5.7L HEMI V8 (around 370 hp and 395 lb-ft of torque), the 6.4L HEMI V8 (around 485 hp and 475 lb-ft of torque), and the supercharged 6.2L HEMI Hellcat V8 (around 707 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque). An 8-speed automatic transmission is standard across all trims. Owners often praise the Charger's performance, comfortable ride (especially in non-performance trims), and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy (especially with the V8 engines), some cheap interior plastics, and the car's large size making it somewhat difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Summary**

The 2018 Dodge Charger, while a popular and enjoyable vehicle, has its share of potential issues. The severity and cost vary, with engine-related problems (especially oil cooler leaks on the V6 and lifter issues on the 5.7L V8) being among the most concerning due to their potential for significant expense. Electrical glitches with the Uconnect system and TPMS are also common annoyances. While not all Chargers will experience these problems, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect any used Charger before purchasing it, as well as ensure proper and timely maintenance.
