### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Dodge Charger generally presents a good reliability record, especially considering its performance-oriented nature and available V8 engines. The Pentastar V6 and the 8-speed automatic transmission are the most common powertrains and have a moderate number of reported issues, primarily related to oil leaks and transmission shifting. The HEMI V8 engines, particularly the 5.7L, can experience issues with lifter wear due to the MDS system, which can be a significant repair. Electrical gremlins, such as Uconnect system glitches and occasional battery drain, are also noted. However, major structural, suspension, or widespread exterior/interior component failures are not commonly reported. With diligent maintenance and addressing specific known issues, the Charger can be a reliable vehicle.
