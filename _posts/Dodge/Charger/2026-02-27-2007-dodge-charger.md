### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Dodge Charger presents a mixed reliability profile. While its V8 HEMI engines are generally well-regarded for performance, they can be prone to oil leaks and specific MDS-related issues. The V6 engines also experience oil leaks and potential overheating. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4-speed, can suffer from harsh shifting and torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the TIPM, are a notable concern, as are common wear items like window regulators and suspension components. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs, especially concerning the electrical system and transmission.
