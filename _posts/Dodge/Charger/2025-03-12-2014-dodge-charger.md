All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Charger's aggressive styling, spacious interior, and powerful engine options. Common complaints included some issues with the electronic systems, and some reliability concerns with specific components.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and potential illuminated check engine light. Often triggered by code P0300 (Random Misfire Detected) or specific cylinder misfire codes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool, and potentially replacement of ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. Sometimes related to carbon buildup on the intake valves, requiring a cleaning service.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak coming from the oil filter adapter/housing. This is a common issue with the Pentastar V6 across several vehicles.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing with an updated design. The original housings were prone to cracking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **"Hemi Tick"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise coming from the engine, especially when cold. The exact cause is debated, but is often attributed to exhaust manifold leaks, lifter issues, or valvetrain noise.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic to determine the source of the noise. The repair could involve replacing exhaust manifold bolts/gaskets, or more extensive work on the valvetrain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ (depending on the source and severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise (especially when cold), exhaust leak smell, reduced fuel economy. Broken exhaust manifold bolts are common on the Hemi V8.
    *   Solution: Removal of broken bolts and replacement of the exhaust manifold gasket and bolts. Sometimes requires manifold replacement if severely warped.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.4L Hemi V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, especially between certain gears. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop. Can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: Initial steps include checking the transmission fluid level and condition. Possible solutions range from a transmission fluid flush to replacement of the valve body or the entire transmission. Software updates sometimes address shift quality issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid check) - $4000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Noise (Clunking/Popping)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noise coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Often related to worn sway bar links, ball joints, or control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the front suspension components and replacement of worn parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per side, depending on the parts needing replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, or unresponsive Uconnect infotainment system. Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system resets, or replacement of the Uconnect module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1000+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False low tire pressure warnings, failure to read tire pressure, TPMS light illuminated on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty TPMS sensors, or reprogramming the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Dodge Charger has some common issues. The 3.6L Pentastar V6 is prone to oil leaks from the oil filter housing and engine misfires. The 5.7L Hemi V8 can suffer from exhaust manifold bolt breakage and the "Hemi tick." The 8-speed automatic transmission can have rough shifting issues. Electrical issues with the Uconnect system and TPMS are also common. These issues range from relatively minor fixes like replacing TPMS sensors to more major repairs like replacing the transmission or oil filter housing, potentially resulting in significant costs to owners.
