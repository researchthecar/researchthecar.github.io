The 2020 Dodge Charger is a full-size sedan that's loved for its aggressive styling, powerful engine options, and spacious interior. However, it also has its share of drawbacks, including relatively poor fuel economy (depending on engine) and some reliability concerns. Engine options for the 2020 Charger include the 3.6L Pentastar V6 (292 hp/260 lb-ft or 300 hp/264 lb-ft), the 5.7L HEMI V8 (370 hp/395 lb-ft), the 6.4L HEMI V8 (485 hp/475 lb-ft), and the supercharged 6.2L HEMI V8 (707 hp/650 lb-ft). All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Common complaints revolve around electrical glitches, interior quality concerns, and drivetrain malfunctions.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights, engine knocking, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Repair options may include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or the entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **"Hemi Tick" Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A distinct ticking or tapping noise coming from the engine, particularly when cold. It may lessen or disappear when the engine warms up. The cause is often attributed to the Multi-Displacement System (MDS) lifters or exhaust manifold leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the exact cause. Replacement of lifters, exhaust manifold bolts/gaskets, or manifolds might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3000+ depending on the source of the sound and the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.4L HEMI V8**

*   **Oil Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden drop in oil pressure, potentially leading to engine damage. Warning lights illuminate, and the engine may run rough or stall.
    *   Solution: Replacing the oil pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L Supercharged HEMI V8**

*   **Supercharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the supercharger, loss of boost, or reduced engine performance. These can be caused by bearing failure or other internal damage to the supercharger unit.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the supercharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $8000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. The transmission may also hesitate or "hunt" for the correct gear.
    *   Solution: Software update or reprogramming the Transmission Control Module (TCM). In some cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4000+ depending on the root cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can be due to worn control arm bushings or sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings or entire suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per corner.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or crashing of the Uconnect infotainment system. Issues with Bluetooth connectivity, navigation, and climate controls are also reported.
    *   Solution: Software updates, resetting the system, or replacing the Uconnect module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1500+ (module replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) illumination due to sensor failures such as O2 sensors, mass airflow sensors, or crank/camshaft position sensors. Engine performance may be affected.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific sensor that has failed and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard panel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Dodge Charger, while offering exciting performance and a bold design, does exhibit some recurring issues. Engine problems, particularly with oil consumption in the 3.6L V6 and potential supercharger issues in the 6.2L V8, can lead to costly repairs. Transmission problems, especially rough shifting, are also a concern. Electrical glitches in the Uconnect system are frequent and annoying. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others like engine or transmission overhauls can be quite pricey. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
