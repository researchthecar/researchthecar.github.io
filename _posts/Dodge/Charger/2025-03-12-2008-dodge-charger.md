Transmission options consist of a 4-speed automatic (primarily with the 2.7L), and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Charger's spacious interior and bold design, but common complaints include reliability issues, especially with electrical components, and higher fuel consumption for V8 models.
