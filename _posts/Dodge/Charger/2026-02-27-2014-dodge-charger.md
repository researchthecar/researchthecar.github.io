### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Dodge Charger offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly with its V6 and less complex V8 variants. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the powertrain, specifically the 3.6L Pentastar engine's intake manifold and oil cooler, and potential lifter wear in the 5.7L HEMI. Transmission issues are less frequent but can manifest as harsh shifting in the 8-speed automatic. Electrical gremlins, such as Uconnect system glitches and occasional battery drain, are also noted. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not universally present across all vehicles. Regular maintenance and addressing early symptoms can mitigate many potential problems, making the Charger a viable option for those seeking a blend of performance and practicality.
