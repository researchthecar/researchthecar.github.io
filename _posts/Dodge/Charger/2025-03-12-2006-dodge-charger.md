The 2006 Dodge Charger marked the return of the iconic nameplate as a four-door sedan, blending retro styling with modern performance. Available engine options included the 2.7L V6 (190 hp, 190 lb-ft torque), the 3.5L V6 (250 hp, 250 lb-ft torque), the 5.7L Hemi V8 (340 hp, 390 lb-ft torque), and later, the high-performance 6.1L Hemi V8 (425 hp, 420 lb-ft torque) in the SRT8 model. The 2.7L and 3.5L V6 engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.7L and 6.1L Hemi V8s used a 5-speed automatic. Many owners appreciated the Charger's bold styling, spacious interior, and powerful engine options, particularly the Hemi V8s. Common complaints often revolved around build quality, reliability issues, and fuel economy (especially with the V8 engines).

**Summary**

The 2006 Dodge Charger, while stylish and powerful, can suffer from several common issues. Engine problems like timing chain and lifter noise, especially in the V6 and V8 models, can be costly. Electrical gremlins stemming from the TIPM are also frequent. Suspension and transmission issues can contribute to overall repair costs. Severity of these issues ranges from moderate inconveniences like blend door failures to major mechanical failures that can sideline the vehicle. Estimated repair costs vary widely, from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to thousands for engine or transmission overhauls. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any 2006 Charger before purchase.
