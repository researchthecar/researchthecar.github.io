### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Dodge Charger presents a mixed reliability profile. The Pentastar V6 engine, while generally solid, can be prone to intake manifold and oil cooler leaks, which are moderately expensive to repair. The HEMI V8 engines are robust, though the 5.7L can experience lifter and camshaft wear related to its Multi-Displacement System (MDS). The 8-speed automatic transmission has seen reports of harsh shifting and torque converter issues, requiring attention. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Uconnect system, and occasional battery drain are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components generally hold up well. Regular maintenance and addressing early signs of these issues can help mitigate potential problems and ensure a more reliable ownership experience.
