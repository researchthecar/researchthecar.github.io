The 2015 Dodge Charger is a full-size sedan that offers a blend of performance, style, and practicality. It was available with a range of engine options, including a 3.6L Pentastar V6 (292 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 5.7L Hemi V8 (370 hp, 395 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.4L Hemi V8 (485 hp, 475 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Charger's aggressive styling, spacious interior, and powerful engine options. Common dislikes include the car's large size, which can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and its relatively poor fuel economy, especially with the V8 engines.
