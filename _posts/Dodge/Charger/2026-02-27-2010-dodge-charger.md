### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Dodge Charger generally presents a good reliability record, particularly with its V6 engine options. The more powerful HEMI V8 engines, while desirable for performance, introduce a higher likelihood of specific issues such as oil leaks and problems with the Multi-Displacement System (MDS), which can incur moderate repair costs. Transmission reliability is generally solid, though some owners have reported harsh shifting or torque converter issues with the automatic transmissions, necessitating potential repairs. Electrical components like power window motors and various sensors are the most commonly cited minor issues. Overall, the Charger is a dependable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific concerns associated with the HEMI engines and automatic transmissions, especially on higher mileage examples.
