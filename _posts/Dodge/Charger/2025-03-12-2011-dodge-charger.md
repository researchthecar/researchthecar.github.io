Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2011 Dodge Charger, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration, following your specified format.

The 2011 Dodge Charger marked a significant redesign for the model, moving into its second generation. Engine options included a 3.6L Pentastar V6 (292 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 5.7L Hemi V8 (370 hp, 395 lb-ft of torque), and the high-performance 6.4L Hemi V8 (470 hp, 470 lb-ft of torque, available in the SRT8). The 3.6L V6 was typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 engines used a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Charger's aggressive styling, spacious interior, and powerful engine options. Common dislikes include fuel economy (especially with the V8s), some perceived cheapness in interior materials, and the relatively dated 5-speed automatic transmission compared to newer, more efficient transmissions available in competitor vehicles at the time.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are commonly found from the oil filter adapter/housing. Symptoms include oil spots under the car, the smell of burning oil, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter adapter/housing. The revised aluminum design is more robust and less prone to warping.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.6L Pentastar engine can experience timing chain wear or failure. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, a check engine light with codes related to timing issues, and potentially rough running or stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **"Hemi Tick" (Lifter Noise)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or tapping noise emanating from the engine, often described as the "Hemi tick." This is usually caused by a failing or worn lifter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters. In some cases, the camshaft may also need to be replaced if damaged by the failing lifter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a hissing or ticking noise, especially on cold starts, and a decrease in fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Removal of the broken bolts and replacement with new ones. This can be a difficult repair as the bolts often break off flush with the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.4L Hemi V8**

*   **"Hemi Tick" (Lifter Noise)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as the 5.7L Hemi V8 - A ticking or tapping noise emanating from the engine, often described as the "Hemi tick." This is usually caused by a failing or worn lifter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters. In some cases, the camshaft may also need to be replaced if damaged by the failing lifter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during shifting, slipping between gears, or harsh/jerky shifts. Can also trigger a check engine light with transmission-related codes.
    *   Solution: Could range from a transmission fluid change and filter replacement to a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) to $3,000+ (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at certain speeds, particularly during light acceleration.  May also cause stalling or difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls many electrical functions in the car. Common symptoms of failure include fuel pump relay failure (causing stalling or no-start conditions), intermittent starting issues, malfunctioning wipers, power window problems, and erratic horn behavior.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM. This is a known issue, and aftermarket rebuilt TIPMs are available at a lower cost than a new OEM unit.

**Summary**

The 2011 Dodge Charger, while stylish and powerful, has some common issues to be aware of. Engine problems like the Pentastar V6 timing chain and oil filter housing leaks, along with the "Hemi tick" in V8 models, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues with the 5-speed automatic are also a concern. The most prevalent electrical issue is the TIPM failure, which can cause a variety of problems. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive to fix. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when making a purchase decision.
