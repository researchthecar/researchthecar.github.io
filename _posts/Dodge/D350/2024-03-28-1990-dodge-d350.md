## 1990 Dodge D350

The 1990 Dodge D350 is a heavy-duty pickup truck that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. It was known for its powerful engines, rugged construction, and spacious cabin. However, like all vehicles, it also had its fair share of problems.

The D350 was offered with a choice of two gasoline engines: a 5.2L V8 and a 5.9L V8. The 5.2L engine produced 230 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque, while the 5.9L engine produced 245 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission.

The D350 was also available with a 5.9L Cummins turbocharged diesel engine. This engine produced 160 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, and it was paired with a 5-speed manual transmission.
