### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Dodge Ram 2500, particularly with the 6.7L Cummins diesel engine, exhibits some common issues related to its emissions control systems (DPF and EGR) and the 68RFE automatic transmission (shudder and overheating). These are often manageable with proper maintenance and timely repairs. The gasoline 5.7L HEMI engine and the G56 manual transmission are generally considered more reliable with fewer reported widespread problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can experience wear due to the truck's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are also noted. Overall, the Ram 2500 is a capable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas for inspection and maintenance.
