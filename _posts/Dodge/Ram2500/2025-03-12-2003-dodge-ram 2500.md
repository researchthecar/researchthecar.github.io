The 2003 Dodge Ram 2500 is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its ruggedness and towing capabilities. Engine options included the 5.7L Hemi V8, the 5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel inline-six, and the 8.0L Magnum V10. The 5.7L Hemi V8 produced around 345 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options varied depending on the engine and included manual and automatic transmissions. Owners often praised the Ram 2500 for its powerful engines, especially the Cummins diesel, its comfortable ride for a heavy-duty truck, and its towing capacity. Common complaints include fuel economy (especially with the V8), some reliability issues (as detailed below), and the truck's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.
