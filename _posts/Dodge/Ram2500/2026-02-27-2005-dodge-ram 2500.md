The 5.7L HEMI and its associated 545RFE transmission generally show better reliability. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items on heavy-duty trucks. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and window regulators are also noted. Rust can be a significant concern depending on the climate. Overall, the Ram 2500 is a capable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues, especially when considering models with the diesel engine and automatic transmission.
