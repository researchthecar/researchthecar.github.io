**Engine**

**5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6**

*   **Lift Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The lift pump supplies fuel to the injection pump. Failure leads to low fuel pressure, hard starting, stalling, and potential damage to the expensive injection pump.
    *   Solution: Replace the lift pump. Upgrading to a higher-flowing aftermarket pump or relocating it closer to the fuel tank is a common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the pump and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VP44 Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VP44 is a common point of failure. Symptoms include hard starting, loss of power, stalling, and diagnostic trouble codes related to fuel delivery.
    *   Solution: Replace the VP44 injection pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+ (depending on pump and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Can cause rough idling, misfires, and poor fuel economy. Often accompanied by excessive smoke (white or black) from the exhaust.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (depending on injectors and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.9L Magnum V8**

*   **"Death Flash" PCM Issue**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The PCM (Powertrain Control Module) can experience a software glitch, leading to rough idling, stalling, and poor performance. It's often referred to as the "Death Flash" because it essentially bricks the PCM.
    *   Solution: Replace or re-flash the PCM. A new PCM is often the only reliable solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (depending on PCM and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cracked Exhaust Manifold**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue that manifests as an exhaust leak sound, reduced fuel economy, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ (depending on the manifold and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8.0L Magnum V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.9L, the V10 is prone to exhaust manifold bolts breaking, leading to exhaust leaks and noise.
    *   Solution: Replace broken exhaust manifold bolts, potentially including manifold replacement if warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the extent of the damage and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (46RE/47RE)**

    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission, specifically addressing the overdrive unit. Upgrading the overdrive unit during a rebuild is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ (depending on rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Can cause shuddering, slipping, and overall poor transmission performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Dodge Ram 2500, while a capable and popular truck, is prone to certain issues due to its age and design. Engine-related problems, particularly with the Cummins diesel (lift pump, VP44 pump), can be expensive to fix. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, are also prevalent. Suspension and steering components require regular maintenance due to the truck's heavy-duty nature. Rust is a significant concern, especially in colder climates. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to substantial repair costs, making it crucial to thoroughly inspect a used 2002 Ram 2500 before purchasing.
