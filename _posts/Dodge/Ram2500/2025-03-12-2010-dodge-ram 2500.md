The 2010 Dodge Ram 2500 is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 5.7L Hemi V8 (383 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), the 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel inline-6 (350 hp, 650 lb-ft of torque), and the less common 4.7L V8. Transmission options largely depend on the engine choice but include 5-speed automatic, 6-speed manual, and 6-speed automatic transmissions. Owners often praise the Ram 2500 for its robust build, powerful diesel engine (when equipped), and comfortable ride for a heavy-duty truck. Common complaints include fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engines), some electrical issues, and the overall size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Summary**

The 2010 Dodge Ram 2500, while a capable truck, has several common issues owners should be aware of. Engine issues like the "Hemi tick" and turbocharger failures on the Cummins diesel can be costly. Transmission problems, especially valve body issues in the 6-speed automatic, are also prevalent. Electrical problems with the TIPM can be frustrating and expensive to resolve. Suspension components like ball joints tend to wear out faster than average. Interior and exterior issues, such as dashboard cracking and rust, can also detract from the overall ownership experience. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant repair bills. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing problems before making a purchase.
