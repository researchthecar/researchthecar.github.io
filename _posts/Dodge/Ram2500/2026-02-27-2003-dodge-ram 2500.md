### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Dodge Ram 2500, particularly with the Cummins diesel engine, is a capable workhorse. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the fuel system (lift pump, injectors) and the 48RE transmission's torque converter and tendency to overheat. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can also require attention due to the truck's heavy-duty nature. Electrical components like the alternator are not immune to failure. While rust can be a concern, especially in certain climates, the core powertrain components, when maintained, offer good longevity. Addressing these common issues proactively can ensure the continued reliability of this robust pickup.
