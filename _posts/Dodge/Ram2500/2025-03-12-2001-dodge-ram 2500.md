**Summary**

The 2001 Dodge Ram 2500 is a capable truck, but age-related issues are prevalent. The Cummins diesel engine, while robust, requires attention to issues like the KDP, lift pump, and VP44 injection pump. The 5.9L and 8.0L gas engines also face issues like exhaust manifold cracks and plenum gasket leaks. Transmission issues vary depending on the transmission type. Suspension components like ball joints and the steering gear box wear out. Electrical problems can stem from the instrument cluster or wiring harness. Rust is a significant concern, especially in certain climates. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work, making thorough inspection essential before purchase.
