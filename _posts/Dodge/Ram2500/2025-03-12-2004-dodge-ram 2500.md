The 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 has some common issues to be aware of, depending on the engine and transmission combination. The 5.7L HEMI can suffer from valve seat and exhaust manifold bolt issues. The 5.9L Cummins is prone to lift pump and injection pump failures, as well as injector problems. Transmission issues vary depending on whether it's the automatic or manual. The NV4500 5-speed manual can experience 5th gear failure, while the NV5600 6-speed manual can have input shaft bearing issues. The automatic transmissions are prone to overdrive clutch and torque converter failure. Suspension problems like ball joint and track bar wear are also common. Electrical issues like PCM failure, instrument cluster problems, and wiring harness issues can also arise. Finally, rust on the cab corners and rocker panels is a known issue. The severity and cost of these issues can range from relatively minor repairs to major overhauls, so it's important to thoroughly inspect any potential purchase and address any existing problems promptly.
