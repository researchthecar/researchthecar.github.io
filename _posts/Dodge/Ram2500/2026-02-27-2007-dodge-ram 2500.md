### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Dodge Ram 2500, particularly with the 6.7L Cummins diesel engine, can present specific reliability concerns. Common issues include DPF and EGR cooler problems for the diesel, and torque converter shudder or overheating for the 68RFE automatic transmission. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins such as instrument cluster and window regulator failures, along with exterior rust and interior wear, are also noted. While the HEMI V8 and manual transmission are generally more robust, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
