### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Dodge Ram 2500, particularly with the 5.9L Cummins diesel, is a capable truck but requires attention to specific components. The VP44 injection pump and lift pump are known failure points for the diesel engine, often requiring significant investment. Manual transmissions can develop synchronizer issues, while automatics may face torque converter or clutch pack problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items on heavy-duty trucks. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM can be frustrating. Rust is a significant concern for exterior longevity. Overall, while robust, owners should be prepared for potential repairs, especially on higher-mileage examples, with the diesel engine and automatic transmission being key areas to monitor.
