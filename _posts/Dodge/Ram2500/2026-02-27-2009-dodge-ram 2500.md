### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Dodge Ram 2500, particularly with the Cummins diesel engine, presents some common issues related to emissions systems (DPF, EGR) and fuel delivery. The HEMI V8 can experience problems with its cylinder deactivation system. Automatic transmissions, especially the 68RFE, may require attention to the torque converter or solenoid pack. Manual transmissions are generally more robust. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are noted for wear. Electrical gremlins can arise from TIPM failures. While not overwhelmingly problematic, owners should be aware of these potential repair areas, especially when purchasing a used model. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the reliability of this heavy-duty truck.
