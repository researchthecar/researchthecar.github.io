### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Dodge Ram 2500, particularly with the Cummins diesel engine, is a capable workhorse. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the fuel system (VP44 pump, injectors) and transmission (48RE overheating, torque converter). The gasoline 5.7L HEMI can experience lifter tick. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items on heavy-duty trucks. Electrical gremlins, especially with the instrument cluster and BCM, can arise. Exterior rust is a significant concern in corrosive environments. Interior issues are generally minor, with HVAC blend doors being a notable point. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these areas will contribute to the overall reliability of this generation Ram.
