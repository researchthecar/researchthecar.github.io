Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2006 Dodge Ram 2500, categorized by system and engine/transmission option.

The 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing capability and robust build. Engine options included a 5.7L Hemi V8, a 5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6, and an 8.0L Magnum V10. The 5.7L Hemi produced around 345 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options primarily included a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual, depending on the engine. Owners often appreciate the truck's power and durability, especially the Cummins diesel, but common complaints revolve around fuel economy, some electrical gremlins, and wear-and-tear items typical of a truck of this age.

**Engine**

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick (Exhaust Manifold Bolts)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or tapping noise, especially noticeable upon cold start. Often caused by broken exhaust manifold bolts, leading to exhaust leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace broken exhaust manifold bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on labor and manifold replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Train Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, noise from the valve train, or misfires could indicate worn valve guides, lifters, or camshaft lobes.
    *   Solution: Inspect the valve train and replace worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+ (depending on severity and parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6**

*   **Lift Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The lift pump (fuel transfer pump) is prone to failure, leading to low fuel pressure at the injection pump. Symptoms include hard starting, stalling, or loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replace the lift pump. Upgrading to an aftermarket, higher-flowing lift pump is a common solution to improve reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 (depending on replacement pump)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty injectors can cause rough running, misfires, white smoke, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) and replace them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector (depending on labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8.0L Magnum V10**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (48RE - Typically behind Cummins and Hemi)**

*   **Overdrive Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping in overdrive, failure to shift into overdrive, or erratic shifting.
    *   Solution: Rebuild the transmission with upgraded overdrive clutches and a stronger valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, slipping, or unusual noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual (G56 - Typically behind Cummins)**

*   **Input Shaft Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive noise from the transmission, especially in neutral or when the clutch is engaged.
    *   Solution: Replace the input shaft bearing. Some owners upgrade to a heavy-duty bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ (depending on labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Loose steering and uneven tire wear can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (depending on whether upper and lower are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Track Bar Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Death wobble" (violent shaking of the front end), loose steering, and wandering on the road.
    *   Solution: Replace the track bar with an upgraded, adjustable unit, and inspect/replace the track bar bracket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, including no-starts, stalling, lighting malfunctions, and power window/door lock issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the TIPM and potentially replace it or have it repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wire Harness Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to age and exposure, wiring harnesses can degrade, causing intermittent electrical problems and sensor malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace damaged sections of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Cab Corners and Rocker Panels)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation in the cab corners and rocker panels is common, especially in areas with road salt.
    *   Solution: Cut out the rusted areas and weld in new metal patches, followed by bodywork and paint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the repair)

**Summary**

The 2006 Dodge Ram 2500, while a capable truck, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues range from relatively inexpensive exhaust manifold bolt repairs on the Hemi to potentially costly injector replacements on the Cummins. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic transmissions, can be significant. Suspension components, particularly ball joints and the track bar, are known wear items. Electrical gremlins associated with the TIPM can be frustrating to diagnose and resolve. Rust is also a concern, especially in certain climates. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, so a thorough inspection is highly recommended before purchasing.
