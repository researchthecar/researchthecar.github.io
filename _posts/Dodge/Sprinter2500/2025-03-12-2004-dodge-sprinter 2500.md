The 2004 Dodge Sprinter 2500 is a versatile and capable cargo van, favored for its high roof, fuel efficiency (for its class), and overall utility. It was offered with a 2.7L inline-5 cylinder diesel engine producing 154 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque, and a 5-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its maneuverability compared to larger vans, and its relatively easy-to-customize cargo area. Common complaints include the cost of parts and repairs, the complexity of some systems, and potential rust issues, particularly in areas with road salt.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline-5 Diesel**

*   **"Black Death" Injector Seal Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a common issue where the copper injector seals fail, causing combustion gases to leak past the injectors. This creates a black, tar-like buildup around the base of the injector. Symptoms include a distinct smell of exhaust in the cabin, a hissing sound from the engine bay, and eventually, difficulty removing the injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace the copper injector seals with new ones. The injector seat may need to be reamed to ensure a proper seal. Injector hold-down bolts should be torqued to the correct specification.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the number of injectors and if machining is required)

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can fail due to oil starvation, wear, or damage from debris. Symptoms include a loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, and a whining noise from the turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Investigate and address the cause of the failure, such as oil leaks or blockages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail due to wear and tear or overheating. Symptoms include slipping, shuddering, and difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Consider replacing the transmission fluid and filter at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body contains the solenoids and valves that control the flow of transmission fluid. These can become worn or clogged, leading to erratic shifting, delayed engagement, and complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially if the van is frequently loaded heavily. This can lead to a rough ride, reduced load capacity, and poor handling. Cracked or broken leaf springs are also possible.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ (per side)
     *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ball joints can wear out leading to excessive play, clunking noises, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (per side)
     *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Glow Plug Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Glow plugs are used to preheat the cylinders for starting in cold weather. When they fail, the engine can be difficult to start, especially in cold temperatures.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty glow plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator provides power to the electrical system and charges the battery. Failure can result in a dead battery, dimming lights, and other electrical problems.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wiring harnesses can suffer from insulation damage, corrosion, and broken wires, especially in areas exposed to the elements. This can lead to a variety of electrical problems, including short circuits, sensor failures, and intermittent issues.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the damaged wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sprinters are prone to rust, particularly in areas with road salt. Common areas for rust include the rocker panels, wheel wells, door bottoms, and around the windshield and taillights.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. Apply rust prevention measures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found
