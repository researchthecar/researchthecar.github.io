The 2007 Dodge Sprinter 2500 is a popular cargo and passenger van known for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel engine), and tall roof options. The 2007 model year offered two engine options: a 3.5L V6 gasoline engine producing 254 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L V6 turbo-diesel engine producing 154 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sprinter's utility and cargo capacity, but common complaints often involve maintenance costs, electrical issues, and some specific engine/transmission problems.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2007 Dodge Sprinter 2500, while valued for its utility, is prone to several common issues. The diesel engine can suffer from "black death" injector problems and turbocharger failures, leading to significant repair costs. Electrical issues, particularly with wiring harnesses and door lock actuators, are also prevalent. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Transmission problems, though not universally experienced, can be expensive to address. While some issues are relatively minor, others can result in substantial repair bills, making thorough inspection and preventative maintenance crucial for prospective buyers.
