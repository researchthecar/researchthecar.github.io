The 2005 Dodge Sprinter 2500 is a popular cargo and passenger van known for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency (for its class), and robust diesel engine. Engine options include the 2.7L Inline-5 CDI Turbo Diesel producing around 154 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque, and the less common 3.5L V6 gasoline engine. The primary transmission is a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Sprinter's tall roof, allowing for stand-up cargo management and conversions into camper vans. Common dislikes include the relatively high cost of maintenance, parts availability challenges, and potential rust issues.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline-5 CDI Turbo Diesel**

*   **"Black Death" (Leaking Injector Seals)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injector seals fail, leading to carbon buildup around the injectors that resembles black tar. Symptoms include a noticeable diesel smell, hissing or chuffing sounds from the engine bay, and potentially rough running.
    *   Solution: Remove the affected injectors (which can be very difficult due to the carbon buildup), clean the injector seats, replace the copper injector seals (using the correct torque specifications), and replace the injector hold-down bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the number of injectors and if professional extraction is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbo, loss of power, black smoke from the exhaust, and potentially oil leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Address any oil feed/drain line issues that may have contributed to the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clogged EGR valve leading to rough idle, poor performance, and potentially an illuminated check engine light.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. Inspect and clean the EGR cooler if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 Gasoline**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, and harsh shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. Consider replacing the transmission fluid and filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at low speeds, and potential transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load capacity, and potentially broken leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs for improved load carrying capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical malfunctions, including lighting issues, window/door lock problems, and issues with the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replace the SAM module. This often requires programming by a qualified technician.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Relay Failure (Diesel Only)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather, and potentially an illuminated check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the glow plug relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially around Wheel Wells, Door Sills, and Roof Seams)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on body panels.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. Treat existing rust to prevent further corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sliding Door Issues (Hard to Open/Close, Rollers)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding door becomes difficult to open or close, often due to worn or damaged rollers.
    *   Solution: Replace the sliding door rollers. Lubricate the door tracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Dodge Sprinter 2500, especially with the diesel engine, is prone to several common issues. The most concerning are related to the diesel engine (injector leaks and turbo failure), transmission problems (valve body), rust, and electrical issues (SAM module). The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (HVAC resistor, glow plug relay) to potentially very expensive (turbo replacement, SAM module, extensive rust repair). Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in the cost of potential repairs when considering a purchase. The diesel issues especially will vary in cost depending on severity.
