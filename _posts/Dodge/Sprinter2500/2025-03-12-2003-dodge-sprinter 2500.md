The 2003 Dodge Sprinter 2500 is a popular cargo van known for its spacious interior and relatively fuel-efficient diesel engine. It's favored for its versatility, making it a common choice for tradespeople, delivery services, and camper van conversions. The 2003 model came with a 2.7L inline-5 cylinder turbo diesel engine (OM612) producing 154 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. One notable dislike of the 2003 Dodge Sprinter is that it is a unique van that doesn't have a lot of spare parts, and the parts that it does have are usually expensive. Other common complaints are that it is an old van, prone to rust, and hard to find mechanics to work on it.
