**Introduction**

The 1991 Dodge Stealth is a Japanese-built sports car that was the result of a joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi. It was sold in the United States from 1991 to 1996 and was available in a variety of trim levels and engine configurations. The base model was powered by a 3.0-liter V6 engine that produced 164 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. The R/T model was powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine that produced 300 horsepower and 303 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

People like the 1991 Dodge Stealth for its sleek styling, powerful engine, and sporty handling. However, the car has also been criticized for its cramped interior, poor fuel economy, and lack of reliability.
