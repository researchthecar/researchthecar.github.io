The 2008 Dodge Nitro is a mid-size SUV known for its distinctive, boxy styling. While some owners appreciate its rugged appearance and towing capability, others find its fuel economy and ride quality to be drawbacks. Engine options included a 3.7L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque and a 4.0L V6 producing 260 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 4-speed automatic (3.7L) and a 5-speed automatic (4.0L).

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Rough Idling/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic idle, occasional stalling, especially at low speeds or when coming to a stop. May be accompanied by a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body and idle air control valve (if equipped) is often the first step. If that doesn't resolve the issue, inspect and replace the manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks, often from the valve cover gaskets or the oil pan gasket. Burning oil smell may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found
