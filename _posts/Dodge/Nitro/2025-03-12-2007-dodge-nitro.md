The 2007 Dodge Nitro is a compact SUV known for its distinctive, boxy styling and truck-like appearance. Available engine options included a 3.7L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 4.0L V6 generating 260 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. The 3.7L was typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 4.0L was mated to a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the Nitro's unique look and available power, but common complaints revolved around its fuel economy, ride quality, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine idles roughly, particularly when cold, and may stall unexpectedly. This is often caused by a faulty Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) or Idle Air Control (IAC) valve.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty TPS or IAC valve. Cleaning the throttle body may also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **P0406 EGR Sensor Circuit High**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illuminated Check Engine Light with the P0406 error code, the vehicle idles rough and may stall unexpectedly. This is often caused by a faulty EGR sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty EGR sensor. Cleaning the EGR valve and passages may also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.0L V6**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, particularly under load. This can be due to worn spark plugs, faulty ignition coils, or vacuum leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace spark plugs, ignition coils, and address any vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and extent of the repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. This can indicate a worn or stretched timing chain. Ignoring this issue can lead to significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Typically paired with 3.7L V6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission shifts harshly between gears, or slips during acceleration. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn clutches, or a faulty valve body.
    *   Solution: Check and refill transmission fluid (using the correct type). If the problem persists, a transmission flush, valve body repair, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid top-off) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (Typically paired with 4.0L V6)**

*   **Torque Converter Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at certain speeds, especially when the torque converter is locking up. Can also cause stalling.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement. A transmission flush may also be beneficial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. This is commonly caused by worn sway bar links, ball joints, or control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace worn sway bar links, ball joints, and/or control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on which components need replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Wear of Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle wander, uneven tire wear, and noise coming from suspension components, indicating excessive play in the ball joints.
    *   Solution: Replacement of ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $600 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as stalling, headlights turning off, wipers not working, or issues starting the vehicle. The TIPM controls many of the vehicle's electrical functions, and failures are common.
    *   Solution: TIPM replacement.

**Summary**

The 2007 Dodge Nitro has several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Electrical problems, particularly with the TIPM, are among the most concerning due to their potential to cause intermittent and unpredictable malfunctions. Engine issues, such as misfires and timing chain problems (especially in the 4.0L V6), and transmission problems can be costly to repair. Suspension issues and rust can also detract from the ownership experience. Overall, while the Nitro offers a unique style, these potential maintenance costs should be considered when evaluating its overall value.
