### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Dodge Nitro presents a mixed reliability profile. While the 4.0L V6 engine and its associated components appear to be relatively robust, the 3.7L V6 has shown a tendency for cooling system and oil leaks. The 4-speed automatic transmission is a common source of concern, with reports of harsh shifting and overheating. Suspension components like ball joints and struts may require attention sooner than expected. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate, and interior comfort systems like HVAC and seat heaters can develop faults. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
