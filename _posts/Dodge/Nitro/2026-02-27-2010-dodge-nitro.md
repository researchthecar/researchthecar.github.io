### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Dodge Nitro presents a mixed reliability profile. Owners should be aware of potential issues primarily concerning the powertrain, particularly the automatic transmissions which can exhibit harsh shifting or overheating. Engine oil leaks and cooling system problems are also noted for both V6 options. Suspension components like ball joints and struts may require attention sooner than expected. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster issues, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor are also reported to fail. While not universally problematic, these areas represent the most frequent technical concerns for this model year.
