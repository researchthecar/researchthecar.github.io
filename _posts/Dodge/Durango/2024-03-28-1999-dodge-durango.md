The most common problems are related to the engine (intake manifold gasket failure, valve cover gasket leaks), transmission (torque converter failure), and suspension (strut mount failure, sway bar link failure). Overall, the repairs are not overly expensive, but some, such as the cylinder head cracking issue on the 3.9L V6 engine, can be quite costly.
