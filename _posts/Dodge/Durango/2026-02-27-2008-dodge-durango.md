### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Dodge Durango, particularly with its V8 engine options, presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine's cylinder head and the Multi-Displacement System (MDS) in the 5.7L HEMI, as well as potential transmission problems like harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the TIPM, can be a significant concern. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also noted for wear. While exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates, interior problems are less prevalent, with HVAC blower motors being a notable, though manageable, concern. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential reliability challenges.
