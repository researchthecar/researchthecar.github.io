### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Dodge Durango, particularly models equipped with the 4.7L and 5.7L HEMI engines, can experience specific mechanical issues such as head gasket failures and cylinder deactivation problems, respectively. Transmission concerns, like torque converter and solenoid issues, are also noted. On the electrical front, Body Control Module malfunctions and alternator failures are potential weak points. Exterior rust and interior HVAC blend door actuator failures are common complaints. While not plagued by a universal set of problems, owners should be aware of these potential repair areas. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can mitigate the severity and cost of these issues.
