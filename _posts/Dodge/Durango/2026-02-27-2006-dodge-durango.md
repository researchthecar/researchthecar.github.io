### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Dodge Durango presents a mixed reliability profile. Its V8 engines, particularly the HEMI, are generally strong but can be prone to specific issues like head gasket failures on the 4.7L and 4.7L, and cylinder deactivation problems on the 5.7L. Transmission issues, especially with the 5-45RFE, can include torque converter problems and overheating. Common non-powertrain concerns involve electrical gremlins, often linked to the TIPM, and suspension wear such as ball joints and tie rods. Rust can also be a significant concern depending on the vehicle's climate history. While capable, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas.
