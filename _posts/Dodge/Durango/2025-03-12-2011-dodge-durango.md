The 2011 Dodge Durango marked a significant redesign, moving to a unibody platform and offering a more refined driving experience. Engine options included a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 290 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L Hemi V8 generating 360 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Durango's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capability. Common dislikes included the relatively poor fuel economy, some early model-year reliability concerns, and the dated 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Electrical**

* **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems such as fuel pump relay failure (leading to stalling), starter motor issues, lighting problems, and other seemingly random electrical malfunctions. The TIPM is a known weak point.
    * Solution: Replacement of the TIPM.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found, but it was a target of class action lawsuits and extended warranty coverage.

* **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window not operating, slow window operation, grinding noise when operating the window.

**Summary**

The 2011 Dodge Durango is a versatile vehicle with a spacious interior and decent performance, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The TIPM and cylinder head problems on the 3.6L V6 can be expensive to repair, while the Hemi tick and exhaust manifold issues on the 5.7L V8 are also common concerns. Suspension issues and electrical glitches can add to the ownership costs. Pre-purchase inspections are recommended to assess the condition of these components. Overall, while not the most reliable vehicle in its class, a well-maintained 2011 Durango can still provide good value.
