The 2002 Dodge Durango was a popular SUV known for its truck-like capabilities and spacious interior. Available engine options included a 3.9L Magnum V6 (210 hp, 245 lb-ft of torque), a 4.7L Magnum V8 (235 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.9L Magnum V8 (250 hp, 345 lb-ft of torque). The Durango was generally well-received for its towing capacity and ruggedness. However, common complaints included relatively poor fuel economy, some electrical issues, and susceptibility to rust in certain climates.

**Engine**

**3.9L Magnum V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**4.7L Magnum V8**

*   **Engine Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, engine knocking, reduced performance, and potential engine failure. Can be caused by infrequent oil changes or using the wrong type of oil.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with the correct oil type (specified in the owner's manual). Engine flush may help in mild cases, but severe cases may require engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (engine flush), $3000 - $6000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.9L Magnum V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable decrease in oil level between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage due to low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Check for leaks. If none found, a possible cause is worn valve stem seals or piston rings. Replacing these components can be costly and may require engine removal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (leak check), $1500 - $4000+ (valve stem seal/piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**All Transmissions (42RE, 44RE, 46RE)**

*   **Slipping or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip between gears, hesitate to shift, or shift harshly. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, a clogged filter, or worn internal components.
    *   Solution: Check and top off transmission fluid. If the fluid is dark or burnt, a transmission service (fluid and filter change) is recommended. If the problem persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50 (Fluid), $100 - $300 (fluid and filter change), $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Loose steering and uneven tire wear can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. It's recommended to replace them in pairs (both upper or both lower) to ensure even wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 (per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Worn Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, wandering, and uneven tire wear. A rattling or clunking noise can also be heard from the front suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn tie rod ends. An alignment is required after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 (per tie rod end, plus alignment)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges may stop working intermittently or completely, including the speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gauge.
    *   Solution: Some people have had success resoldering the connections on the back of the instrument cluster. However, the most reliable fix is to replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (DIY resolder, if applicable), $200 - $500+ (instrument cluster replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power windows or door locks may stop working intermittently or completely. The driver's side switch panel is a common source of failure.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty switch panel or repair any broken wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (switch panel replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially Rocker Panels and Quarter Panels)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust develops on the rocker panels, quarter panels, and other areas of the body, especially in regions with road salt.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. This can range from minor spot repairs to extensive bodywork.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on severity and extent of rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner material detaches from the backing and sags down, obstructing the view and looking unsightly.
    *   Solution: Replace the headliner material or have it professionally repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2002 Dodge Durango has a mix of issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical problems and interior cosmetic issues to more significant engine and transmission concerns. Engine sludge buildup in the 4.7L V8 and excessive oil consumption in the 5.9L V8 can lead to costly repairs if not addressed promptly. Transmission slippage is also a common issue. Rust can be a major problem, especially in areas with harsh winters. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and thoroughly inspect any 2002 Durango before purchasing, paying particular attention to engine maintenance records, transmission condition, and the presence of rust. The cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the severity of the problem, but major engine or transmission work can be quite expensive.
