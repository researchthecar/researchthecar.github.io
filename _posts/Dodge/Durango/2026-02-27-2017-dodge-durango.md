### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Dodge Durango generally presents a solid reliability record, especially when equipped with the 3.6L V6 engine. The 5.7L HEMI, while powerful, has a higher propensity for oil-related issues and potential valvetrain wear. Transmission concerns, primarily with the 8-speed automatic, can manifest as shifting irregularities, often addressable with software or fluid services. Electrical gremlins, particularly within the Uconnect infotainment system and occasional battery drain issues, are the most commonly cited non-powertrain problems. Overall, the Durango is a dependable choice for those seeking a large SUV, with most potential issues being manageable and not indicative of systemic failure across the model range.
