The 2014 Dodge Durango is a three-row SUV that offers a blend of truck-like capability and family-friendly comfort. Engine options include the 3.6L Pentastar V6 (290 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque) and the 5.7L Hemi V8 (360 hp and 390 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Durango for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and relatively sporty handling for its size. Common dislikes include the fuel economy (especially with the V8) and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Cylinder Head Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2011-2014 3.6L engines, including those in the Durango, experienced cylinder head failures, typically on the left (driver's) side. Symptoms include misfires, rough idling, and check engine light illumination. The issue is often caused by overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Cooler Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil cooler adapter can crack and leak oil, leading to loss of oil pressure and potential engine damage. This can be identified by visible oil leaks near the oil filter housing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the oil cooler adapter with an updated design (aluminum).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **"Hemi Tick" (Exhaust Manifold Bolts)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or clicking noise, particularly noticeable at idle or low speeds, often emanating from the exhaust manifold area. This is commonly due to broken exhaust manifold bolts, leading to exhaust leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the extent of damage and if the manifold needs replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Multiple Displacement System (MDS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MDS system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can sometimes cause issues such as rough idling, hesitation, or a lack of power. The solenoids used to activate the MDS lifters can fail, or the lifters themselves can collapse.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty MDS solenoids or lifters, and in some cases, a complete camshaft replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (845RE)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or hesitation when accelerating. This can be due to valve body issues, solenoid failures, or internal transmission damage.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve the issue. However, more severe cases may require valve body replacement, solenoid replacement, or a transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) to $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls:
        *   Recall Number: 16V521000
        *   Recall Number: 16V240000

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This is sometimes attributed to worn sway bar bushings or links.
    *   Solution: Replacing the sway bar bushings and/or links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Wear of Front End Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear in front end components, like ball joints and tie rod ends, causing loose steering and noises.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn components, followed by an alignment.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system can experience a range of issues, including freezing, crashing, unresponsive touchscreens, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In more severe cases, the Uconnect module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $800+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls:
        *   Recall Number: 18V049000
        *   Recall Number: 17V500000
        *   Recall Number: 18V332000
        *   Recall Number: 17V824000
        *   Recall Number: 16V816000
        *   Recall Number: 15V789000
        *   Recall Number: 14V530000

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM is a central electrical hub that controls various vehicle functions. Failures can lead to a wide array of problems, including fuel pump relay failure (causing stalling or no-start conditions), wiper malfunctions, power window issues, and airbag warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power liftgate not operating correctly, or failure of the liftgate latch, preventing the liftgate from opening or closing properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate motor, latch assembly, or related wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Heated Seat Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Heated seats not working or overheating. This can be due to a faulty heating element or a problem with the control module.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Dodge Durango has some notable reliability concerns, particularly with the engine (both V6 and V8), electrical system (Uconnect and TIPM), and transmission. Cylinder head failures on the V6 and MDS issues on the V8 can be expensive. Electrical gremlins stemming from the TIPM can be frustrating and costly to diagnose and fix. Transmission issues, though less common, can also be a significant expense. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, and the cost to repair can vary widely. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect any used 2014 Durango before purchasing.
