The 2013 Dodge Durango is a mid-size SUV known for its rugged styling, comfortable ride, and available third-row seating. Engine options include a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 290 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, a 5.7L Hemi V8 producing 360 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, with the 3.6L V6 optionally equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Durango's spacious interior, towing capacity, and available all-wheel drive. Common complaints include reliability issues, particularly with electrical components, and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Cylinder Head Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2013 Durangos equipped with the 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine have experienced cylinder head failures, typically manifesting as a ticking noise from the engine, misfires, check engine light illumination, and rough running. This issue is often attributed to a specific casting flaw in certain cylinder heads.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected cylinder head is generally required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks in the oil filter housing, which is made of plastic in many of these vehicles, are a common issue. Symptoms include oil leaks, oil puddles under the vehicle, and the smell of burning oil.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing. Updated aluminum versions are available as aftermarket upgrades.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking sound coming from the engine, especially when cold. This can be caused by exhaust manifold bolts breaking, or collapsed lifters.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold bolts and gaskets, or replacement of the affected lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for manifold bolts; $1,500 - $4,000+ for lifters.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Multiple Displacement System (MDS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MDS system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, can sometimes cause issues such as rough idling, hesitation, and misfires.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the MDS system can involve replacing solenoids, lifters, or other components. A tuner to disable MDS altogether is another option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between gears. Slipping can also occur, where the engine revs up but the vehicle doesn't accelerate properly.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change may provide temporary relief. Rebuilding or replacing the transmission is often the ultimate solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid flush and filter; $2,500 - $5,000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Optional 3.6L V6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5-speed, some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between gears. Slipping can also occur, where the engine revs up but the vehicle doesn't accelerate properly.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change may provide temporary relief. Rebuilding or replacing the transmission is often the ultimate solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid flush and filter; $2,500 - $5,000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can be caused by worn bushings, sway bar links, or shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components, such as bushings, links, or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls many of the vehicle's electrical functions. Failures can manifest in a wide range of issues, including the vehicle not starting, fuel pump relay failure, stalling, power windows not working, lights malfunctioning, and wipers not working.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found, but there was a class action lawsuit settlement related to TIPM issues in Chrysler vehicles, potentially offering reimbursement for repairs.

*   **Uconnect System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, screen glitches, and Bluetooth connectivity problems with the Uconnect infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software updates, resetting the system, or replacing the Uconnect module.
