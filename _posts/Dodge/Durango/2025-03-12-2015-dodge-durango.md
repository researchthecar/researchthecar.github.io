Here's a breakdown of common problems and complaints associated with the 2015 Dodge Durango, categorized by major component and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2015 Dodge Durango is a popular SUV known for its spacious interior, strong towing capacity, and available V8 power. Engine options include a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 290 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L Hemi V8 producing 360 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Durango's comfortable ride and versatile cargo space but sometimes complain about fuel economy and electronic issues.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Faulty Rocker Arm**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The needle bearings within the rocker arms can fail, leading to excessive engine noise (ticking or clicking sound), rough idling, misfires, and potentially engine damage if not addressed. This issue seems more prevalent in earlier production runs of the Pentastar V6.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected rocker arms and potentially the camshaft if it has been damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the extent of the damage and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic oil filter housing can crack or warp, leading to oil leaks. These leaks can be messy and, if left unaddressed, can lead to low oil levels and engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing, often with an updated aluminum version to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+, depending on labor and whether an OEM or aftermarket part is used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **HEMI Tick**
    * Description/Symptoms: A distinct ticking noise coming from the engine, often described as a "tick" or "tap" that is most noticeable when the engine is warm or idling. The cause can vary, and its not a guarantee the engine will have problems.
    * Solution: Addressing the "HEMI tick" can range from oil additives to valve train adjustments, to more extensive repairs like camshaft or lifter replacement. In some cases, it may be deemed a normal characteristic of the engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for oil additives) - $3000+ depending on the diagnosis and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Manifold Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken or loosened exhaust manifold bolts that cause a ticking noise from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing broken bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8-speed automatic transmission can exhibit rough or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. Some owners also report hesitation when accelerating.
    *   Solution: A software update can sometimes resolve shifting issues. In other cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (for software update) - $4,000+ (for rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip out of gear or fail to engage properly, especially during acceleration or uphill climbs.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the cause of the slipping and repair, which may include replacing damaged clutches, valve body repair or replacement, or complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the severity of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure (Especially with Tow Package)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive noise from the rear suspension. This is more common in Durangos equipped with the tow package and those that are frequently used for towing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers. Upgrading to heavy-duty shocks may be a good option for those who tow regularly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ for parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the Uconnect infotainment system, including screen freezes, Bluetooth connectivity issues, navigation malfunctions, and unresponsive touch controls.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes fix these issues. In other cases, the Uconnect module may need to be replaced.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Failure**

**Summary**

The 2015 Dodge Durango has some common issues, but the severity varies. Engine problems, particularly with the rocker arms on the 3.6L and the "HEMI tick" on the 5.7L, can be costly to repair if left unaddressed. Transmission issues can also be significant expenses. Electrical gremlins, such as Uconnect problems and TIPM failures, are common and potentially frustrating. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others can run into the thousands of dollars. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used Durango before purchasing.
