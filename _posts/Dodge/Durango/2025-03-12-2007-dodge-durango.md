The 2007 Dodge Durango is a full-size SUV known for its ruggedness and towing capacity. Engine options included a 3.7L Magnum V6, a 4.7L Magnum V8, and a 5.7L HEMI V8. The 3.7L V6 produced around 210 hp and 235 lb-ft of torque. The 4.7L V8 put out 235 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque, and the 5.7L HEMI V8 generated 335 hp and 370 lb-ft of torque.
