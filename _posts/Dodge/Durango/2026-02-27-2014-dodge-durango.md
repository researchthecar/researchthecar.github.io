### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Dodge Durango, particularly with its available V6 and V8 engines, is generally a reliable vehicle. Common issues tend to be concentrated in areas like potential coolant and oil leaks from the V6 and V8 engines respectively, and some transmission-related concerns such as harsh shifting or torque converter problems, especially with the 8-speed automatic. Suspension components like ball joints can wear over time, leading to noise. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module or alternator, and infotainment system glitches are also noted. However, many of these issues are repairable and not indicative of systemic failure across the model. Regular maintenance and addressing early signs of trouble can significantly prolong the life and reliability of the 2014 Durango.
