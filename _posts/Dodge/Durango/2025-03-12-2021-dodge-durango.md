The 2021 Dodge Durango is a popular mid-size SUV known for its aggressive styling, powerful engine options, and surprising practicality. Available engines include the 3.6L Pentastar V6 (295 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), the 5.7L Hemi V8 (360 hp, 390 lb-ft of torque), and the monstrous 6.2L Supercharged Hemi V8 (710 hp, 645 lb-ft of torque) found in the SRT Hellcat variant. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Durango's towing capacity, spacious interior, and user-friendly infotainment system.
