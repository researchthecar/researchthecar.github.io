### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Dodge Durango presents a mixed reliability profile. The Pentastar V6 and HEMI V8 engines, while powerful, have documented issues like intake manifold leaks and oil consumption, respectively. The 5-speed automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting and torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the TIPM, are a notable concern. Suspension components like ball joints can wear prematurely. However, the exterior and interior generally hold up well. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in possible repair costs, especially for the engine and transmission, when considering a used 2011 Durango.
