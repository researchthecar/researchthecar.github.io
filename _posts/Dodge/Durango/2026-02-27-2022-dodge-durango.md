# 2022 Dodge Durango

### Overview
The 2022 Dodge Durango presents a mixed bag in terms of technical reliability. While it offers robust performance and a spacious interior, certain powertrain configurations and electronic systems have shown a propensity for specific issues. Owners have reported concerns primarily related to the engine and transmission in some variants, particularly those with higher mileage or under demanding use. Electrical gremlins and some interior component wear are also noted, though generally not to a degree that significantly impacts daily drivability for most users. The suspension and exterior components have generally held up well, indicating solid build quality in these areas. Overall, the Durango is a capable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific reliability trends associated with different engine and transmission choices.

### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Dodge Durango is a capable and powerful SUV, but its reliability can vary depending on the chosen powertrain. The 3.6L V6 and 6.4L V8 engines, along with their associated transmissions, generally exhibit good reliability. However, the 5.7L HEMI V8 has seen some reports of oil cooler line leaks, and the 8-speed automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit harsh shifting or hesitation, often addressable with software updates. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Interior components show typical wear for the model year. For those prioritizing reliability, the V6 or the high-performance V8 variants might be preferable, with awareness of potential transmission software needs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any reported leaks are advised.
