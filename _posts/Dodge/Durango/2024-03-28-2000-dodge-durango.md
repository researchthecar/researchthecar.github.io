**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

- **Shifting Problems:** Hard shifting, delayed shifting, or slipping gears can indicate a problem with the transmission control module (TCM), solenoids, or torque converter. Symptoms include inconsistent shifting patterns and decreased transmission performance. The solution involves replacing the faulty component. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

**Suspension**

- **Ball Joint Failure:** The ball joints can wear out, leading to loose steering and clunking noises when going over bumps. The solution is to replace the ball joints. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
- **Rear Axle Seal Leak:** The rear axle seal can leak, causing a loss of differential fluid. Symptoms include a whining or growling noise from the rear differential and fluid leaking onto the ground. The solution is to replace the rear axle seal. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Electrical**

- **Air Conditioner Compressor Failure:** The air conditioner compressor can fail, resulting in a loss of cool air from the vents. Symptoms include warm or no air from the vents, a humming or grinding noise from the compressor, and decreased fuel efficiency. The solution is to replace the compressor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+

**Summary:**
