The 2005 Dodge Durango is a full-size SUV that was offered with several engine and transmission options. Popular for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and rugged styling, the Durango also had its share of common problems. Engine options included a 3.7L Magnum V6 (210 hp and 235 lb-ft of torque), a 4.7L Magnum V8 (235 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.7L HEMI V8 (335 hp and 370 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options varied depending on the engine, primarily a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Durango's power and cargo space, but often dislike its fuel economy and some of its reliability issues.

**Engine**

**3.7L Magnum V6**

*   **Sluggish Performance**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.7L V6 engine can feel underpowered, especially when towing or carrying heavy loads. Drivers report slow acceleration and difficulty maintaining speed on hills.
    *   Solution: Ensure the engine is properly maintained with regular tune-ups, including spark plug replacement and cleaning the throttle body. Consider aftermarket performance upgrades, such as a cold air intake or performance exhaust, but results may vary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on maintenance or upgrades)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.7L Magnum V8**

*   **Valve Seat Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with valve seats becoming loose or dropping into the cylinder, leading to engine damage and misfires. Symptoms include rough idling, loss of power, and unusual engine noises.
    *   Solution: The only real solution is to remove the head, replace the valve seats, and inspect for any piston damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4.7L V8 can be prone to oil leaks, particularly from the valve cover gaskets and the oil pan gasket.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets with new ones. Ensure proper torque when tightening bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **HEMI Tick (Exhaust Manifold Bolts)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking noise, often described as the "HEMI tick," can be caused by broken exhaust manifold bolts. This allows exhaust gases to escape, creating the ticking sound, especially upon cold starts.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold bolts. In some cases, the exhaust manifold itself may need to be replaced if warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (42RLE / 45RFE)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. These issues can be caused by a failing solenoid pack, worn valve body, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the shifting problems. Common fixes include replacing the solenoid pack, rebuilding the valve body, or performing a transmission flush and filter change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the severity and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission (545RFE)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4-speed, the 5-speed can also experience hard or erratic shifting. Can also include slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. These issues can be caused by a failing solenoid pack, worn valve body, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the shifting problems. Common fixes include replacing the solenoid pack, rebuilding the valve body, or performing a transmission flush and filter change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the severity and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Clunking/Wandering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps, can indicate worn ball joints, tie rod ends, or sway bar links. Wandering steering can also be a symptom.
    *   Solution: Inspect the suspension components and replace any worn or damaged parts. A front-end alignment is recommended after suspension work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, especially if the vehicle is frequently used for towing or hauling heavy loads. This can lead to a rough ride and reduced handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs or add helper springs to increase load capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM controls various electrical functions, and failures can lead to a wide range of problems, including fuel pump issues, starting problems, erratic wiper operation, and malfunctioning lights.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the TIPM and replace it if necessary. Some electrical shops specialize in repairing TIPMs, which can be a cheaper alternative to replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to go up or down, often accompanied by clicking noises from the door.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the rocker panels and around the wheel wells, especially in areas with harsh winters or salty roads.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the rusted panels. This can involve cutting out the rusted sections and welding in new metal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates, due to exposure to sunlight and heat.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard (expensive) or install a dashboard cover to protect it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (cover) - $1,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to control the temperature of the air coming from the vents (e.g., only hot air blowing), caused by a faulty blend door actuator. A clicking sound behind the dash is often heard when the actuator is failing.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found
