The 2020 Dodge Durango is a popular SUV known for its muscular styling, powerful engine options, and impressive towing capacity. It appeals to those who need a family-friendly vehicle with truck-like capabilities. Engine options include the 3.6L Pentastar V6 (295 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), the 5.7L HEMI V8 (360 hp, 390 lb-ft of torque), and the beastly 6.4L HEMI V8 (475 hp, 470 lb-ft of torque) in the SRT model. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Durango's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include fuel economy, particularly with the V8 engines, and some reported issues with electronics.

**Summary**

The 2020 Dodge Durango, while offering impressive performance and practicality, is not without its potential issues. The engine-related problems, particularly the "HEMI tick" and exhaust manifold bolt failures, can be concerning for V8 owners. The electrical issues, particularly with the Uconnect system, are a common complaint. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, especially those involving the transmission or engine internals. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have a qualified mechanic inspect the vehicle before purchase.
