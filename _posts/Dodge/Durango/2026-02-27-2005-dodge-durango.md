### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Dodge Durango, particularly with its V8 engine options, can be a capable and durable SUV if well-maintained. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine's head gaskets (especially on the 4.7L and 3.7L), potential oil leaks, and transmission overheating or solenoid issues. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM, and interior comfort systems like HVAC blend doors are also noted. Rust can be a concern depending on climate. Despite these potential drawbacks, addressing them proactively can lead to a reliable ownership experience for this generation of Durango.
