The 2022 Dodge Durango is a popular SUV known for its aggressive styling, powerful engine options, and surprisingly good handling for its size. Engine options include the 3.6L Pentastar V6 (295 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), the 5.7L Hemi V8 (360 hp, 390 lb-ft of torque), and the monstrous 6.4L Hemi V8 (475 hp, 470 lb-ft of torque). For a limited time, the SRT Hellcat trim was available with a supercharged 6.2L V8, but that has since been discontinued. The Durango is generally liked for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and performance, particularly in the higher trim levels. Some common complaints include its relatively poor fuel economy, dated interior design compared to some competitors, and higher price point compared to other SUVs in its class. All engine options are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, check engine light illumination, diagnostic codes indicating misfires on specific cylinders. Can be caused by faulty ignition coils, fuel injectors, or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty ignition coil, fuel injector, or spark plug.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ depending on the cause and number of components that need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak from the oil filter housing area, oil pooling in the engine bay, low oil level warning. This issue is common on the earlier plastic oil filter housings, but can occur on the updated aluminum version as well.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ depending on labor and whether the updated aluminum housing is installed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise coming from the engine, especially when cold. Some report it dissipates with engine warm up. There's no widely accepted cause, but it may be caused by excessive valve train lash.
    *   Solution: There is no definitive solution. Some owners have tried using thicker oil or different oil filters, but results vary. In some cases, valve train components replacement may be attempted, though success is not guaranteed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $2000+ depending on the attempted solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing noise from the engine, especially upon startup. The noise may diminish as the engine warms up. This is due to broken exhaust manifold bolts, which allows exhaust gases to leak.
    *   Solution: Removal of the broken bolts and replacement of the exhaust manifold gasket and bolts. In some cases, the manifold itself may need to be replaced if it is warped.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.4L Hemi V8**

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, loss of power, check engine light illumination. Can be caused by valve spring failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of valve springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noises from the engine, loss of power, and possible engine misfires. This can be caused by collapsed lifters.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft if it is damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears. Transmission slipping, where the engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed. This issue can sometimes be attributed to software glitches or low transmission fluid levels.
    *   Solution: First, check and top off the transmission fluid level. Then, a software update may be required. If the issue persists, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid top-off) - $500 (software update) - $1500+ (valve body) - $3000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes and restarts unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, the Uconnect module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500 - $1500+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera image is distorted, blurry, or completely black.

**Summary**

The 2022 Dodge Durango, while offering a compelling blend of performance and practicality, does have its share of potential issues. The engine problems, particularly with the V8 options (Hemi Tick, valve spring failure, and lifter failure), can be costly and concerning. Transmission issues, although potentially resolvable with software updates, can sometimes require more significant repairs. Electrical glitches with the Uconnect system and backup camera are also common complaints. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
