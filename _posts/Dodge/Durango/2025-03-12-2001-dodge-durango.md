**Summary**

The 2001 Dodge Durango, while generally a capable vehicle, suffers from a range of age-related issues. Engine problems can range from relatively minor sensor replacements to more significant intake manifold leaks. Transmission issues, particularly slipping and erratic shifting, can be costly to address. Suspension components are prone to wear, requiring replacement of ball joints, tie rod ends, and leaf springs. Electrical problems, such as a faulty instrument cluster, can also be a nuisance. Exterior rust is common, and interior plastics are susceptible to cracking. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase.
