**Introduction:**

The 2000 Dodge Ram 3500 Van is a full-size van offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine is a 5.2L V8 producing 230 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine is a 5.9L V8 producing 245 horsepower and 345 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

Owners generally appreciate the vehicle's spacious interior, powerful engines, and towing capability. However, they have reported a range of issues with the vehicle, including engine and transmission problems, suspension issues, and electrical faults.

**Engine**

**5.2L V8**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** This issue causes coolant and oil to leak from the engine, leading to overheating and engine damage. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, coolant leaks, and reduced engine power. The solution involves replacing the intake manifold gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Exhaust manifold cracks:** This issue allows exhaust gases to escape, causing a loud noise and decreased engine performance. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. The solution involves replacing the exhaust manifold. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $600
* **Clogged fuel injectors:** This issue prevents fuel from being delivered to the engine properly, leading to rough idling, poor acceleration, and reduced power. Symptoms include difficulty starting, hesitation during acceleration, and black smoke from the exhaust. The solution involves cleaning or replacing the fuel injectors. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400 per injector

**5.9L V8**

* **Cylinder head gasket failure:** This issue occurs when the gasket between the cylinder head and engine block fails, allowing coolant and oil to leak. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, coolant leaks, and overheating. The solution involves replacing the cylinder head gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Valve train noise:** This issue is caused by worn valve train components, such as lifters or pushrods. Symptoms include a ticking or tapping noise from the engine. The solution involves replacing the worn components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,200+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** This issue occurs when the transmission is unable to properly engage gears, resulting in a loss of power. Symptoms include difficulty shifting, hesitation or slipping during acceleration, and increased RPMs. The solution involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,000 - $3,000+
* **Transmission fluid leaks:** This issue can occur due to a faulty gasket or seal in the transmission. Symptoms include fluid leaks, delayed shifting, and burnt fluid smell. The solution involves replacing the gasket or seal. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+
