The 2001 Dodge Ram 3500 Van, also known as the Ram Van or B-Van, was a full-size cargo and passenger van known for its utility and spacious interior. It was available with a range of engine options including the 3.9L Magnum V6 (around 175 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque), the 5.2L Magnum V8 (around 230 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque), and the 5.9L Magnum V8 (around 245 horsepower and 335 lb-ft of torque) which is our focus here. The 5.9L V8 was generally paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, although a manual transmission was available in some configurations. Owners often appreciate the van's reliability, ease of maintenance, and ample cargo space. Common dislikes include its fuel economy, relatively basic interior, and aging design.

**Engine**

**5.9L Magnum V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Plenum Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plenum gasket between the intake manifold and the lower intake (plenum) is prone to failure. This results in an engine vacuum leak, rough idle, poor fuel economy, and potential pinging or detonation. A hissing sound might be audible.
    *   Solution: Replace the plenum gasket with an updated, more durable gasket. Some owners also opt to replace the entire plenum with an aftermarket unit that addresses design flaws of the original.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on whether the entire plenum is replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crank Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The crank position sensor provides the engine control unit (ECU) with information about the engine's crankshaft position. Failure of this sensor can result in a no-start condition, stalling, or intermittent engine performance issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the crank position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Temperature Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The coolant temperature sensor sends a signal to the computer about the engines current coolant temperature. If this sensor fails, the computer does not know how hot the coolant is and can result in poor performance, rough idling, poor fuel economy, and overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the coolant temperature sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $75 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**46RE 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Overdrive Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 46RE transmission is known for overdrive clutch wear and eventual failure. Symptoms include slipping in overdrive (4th gear), delayed engagement, and shuddering.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission, paying particular attention to upgrading the overdrive clutch pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Solenoid Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The solenoid pack controls the fluid flow and shifting within the transmission. Failure can lead to erratic shifting, failure to shift into certain gears, or getting stuck in a gear.
    *   Solution: Replace the solenoid pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front ball joints are prone to wear, especially under heavy use or with larger wheel/tire combinations. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, wandering steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken Leafs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially when the van is frequently used for hauling heavy loads. This can reduce ride height, affect handling, and potentially lead to broken leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs, either with stock replacements or heavy-duty aftermarket options.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power window motors can fail due to age and heavy use, resulting in windows that are slow to operate or do not operate at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators can fail, causing the power door locks to malfunction. The door may not lock or unlock properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially around Wheel Wells and Rocker Panels)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: These vans are prone to rust, particularly in areas exposed to road salt and moisture. This can lead to structural damage.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. Rust prevention measures should be taken.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sliding Door Latch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding door latch mechanism can become worn or damaged, making it difficult to open or close the sliding door securely.
