### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Dodge Ram 3500 Van is a generally dependable vehicle, especially its powertrain when properly maintained. The gasoline V8 engines are robust but can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and distributor wear. The Cummins diesel, while powerful, is susceptible to lift pump and the notorious VP44 injector pump failures, which can be costly. Automatic transmissions may require attention to the torque converter and overdrive components. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items on heavy-duty vehicles. Electrical issues often stem from the BCM or alternator. Exterior rust is a concern for older models, and interior wear on seats and HVAC blower motors are also noted. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these potential issues, the Ram 3500 Van can remain a reliable work vehicle.
