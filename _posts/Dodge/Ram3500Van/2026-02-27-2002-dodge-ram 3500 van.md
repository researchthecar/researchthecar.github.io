### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Dodge Ram 3500 Van is a capable and generally reliable vehicle, especially when equipped with the robust 5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel. Common issues tend to be concentrated in areas like the fuel injection system, potential cylinder head cracks on the diesel, and intake manifold gaskets on the V10. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 47RE, can experience torque converter or internal wear. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are also noted for wear, as expected for a heavy-duty vehicle. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, and rust on body panels are also points to consider. Despite these potential issues, with proper maintenance and timely repairs, the Ram 3500 Van can continue to serve effectively for many years.
