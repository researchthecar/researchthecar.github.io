The 2013 Dodge Attitude is a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets. It was essentially a rebadged Hyundai Accent RB. The 2013 Attitude offered a 1.4-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing approximately 107 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Attitude for its affordability and fuel efficiency. Common complaints often revolve around its somewhat basic interior, limited features, and the performance limitations of the engine, especially when fully loaded or driving uphill.

**Engine**

**1.4L Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and use of high-quality oil may mitigate the issue. If consumption is severe, a mechanic may need to inspect for leaks, worn piston rings, or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change/top off), $500 - $2000+ (if internal engine repair is required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idling Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Random idling issues, mostly on cold starts, are being seen on this model. Some symptoms include stalling, misfiring and shuddering during idle
    *   Solution: Check and/or replace the idle control valve or idle air control solenoid
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience harsh or jerky shifting between gears, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may improve shifting. If the problem persists, it could indicate worn solenoids or valve body issues requiring professional diagnosis and repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $500 - $1500+ (if solenoids/valve body need replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission is slipping while changing gears, specifically from 3rd to 4th gear.
    *   Solution: Transmission replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported faster than expected wear of suspension components like struts, shocks, and bushings, leading to a rougher ride and potentially affecting handling. No specific version of a part can be confirmed.
    *   Solution: Replace worn components with quality aftermarket or OEM parts. Regularly inspect the suspension for signs of wear or damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on which components need replacement and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure or slow operation of power windows. This can be due to a faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component causing the issue and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS and Wheel Speed Sensors fail often, causing a loss of functionality in the antilock brakes, electronic brake distribution and traction control.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (depending on the sensors and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Poor Quality Plastics**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Interior plastics fade and crack easily, especially on the dash.
    *   Solution: Use protectant such as Armor All.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $20
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the bottom of the vehicle, and around body paneling.
    *   Solution: Proper rust preventative measures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2013 Dodge Attitude, while appreciated for its affordability, exhibits several common issues. Engine problems such as excessive oil consumption and idling issues can lead to moderate repair costs. Transmission issues, especially harsh shifting, can become costly if left unaddressed. Suspension and electrical problems are also frequently reported, contributing to potential maintenance expenses. Overall, while most issues are not catastrophic, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for repairs and maintenance, especially with older models.
