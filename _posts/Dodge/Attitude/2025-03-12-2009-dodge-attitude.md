The 2009 Dodge Attitude, a rebadged Hyundai Accent, was marketed as a fuel-efficient and affordable compact sedan. It came with a 1.4-liter inline-4 engine producing around 97 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciated its price point and fuel economy, while others disliked its relatively basic features and sometimes underwhelming performance.

**Engine**

**1.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, noticeable loss of power, check engine light illuminating, and the engine may shake excessively. Often caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cylinder misfiring, replace the faulty ignition coil or spark plug(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the extent of the repair and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, decreased fuel economy, rough idling, and potential issues with emissions testing.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor(s). May need upstream or downstream sensors replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ depending on the location and number of sensors replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling sound from underneath the vehicle, reduced engine performance, check engine light (often P0420 code), and failing emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ due to the cost of the part and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts between gears, especially 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 3rd. The transmission may also hesitate before engaging.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change may temporarily alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal wear could be the cause, requiring more extensive repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100- $200+ for fluid flush and filter. $500 - $1500+ for valve body work or transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs rise without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. The transmission might also unexpectedly shift into neutral.
    *   Solution: Inspect the transmission fluid level and condition. If low or contaminated, perform a fluid flush and filter change. If the slipping persists, internal damage to the clutch packs or other components may necessitate a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100- $200+ for fluid flush and filter. $1500 - $3000+ for transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Hard to Shift into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging specific gears, grinding noises during shifts, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust the clutch cable. If the problem remains, inspect the synchronizers and shift linkages for wear or damage. Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, or throw-out bearing might also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ for clutch cable adjustment or replacement. $500 - $1200+ for clutch replacement or internal transmission repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing after bumps, poor handling, increased body roll in corners, and premature tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shock absorbers/struts. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per axle, including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Stabilizer Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn stabilizer bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car is slow to start or doesn't start at all, especially after sitting for a while. May need to jump start the car regularly.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system to confirm proper voltage and amperage. Look for parasitic drains from aftermarket accessories or faulty electrical components. Could be caused by a failing alternator, or a component that is still drawing power when the car is off.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement. $200 - $500+ for alternator replacement. Diagnostic costs may vary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows operate erratically, move slowly, or fail to operate altogether.
    *   Solution: Check the power window switch and motor. Lubricate window tracks, and inspect wiring for damage.

**Summary**

The 2009 Dodge Attitude, while marketed as an economical option, faces typical issues associated with older vehicles in its class. Common problems include engine misfires, transmission issues (particularly harsh shifting or slipping), worn suspension components, and electrical malfunctions. While most of the issues are not considered catastrophic, the cost to repair them can add up over time, especially considering the age of the vehicle. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to assess the condition of the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems.
