### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Dodge Attitude is a budget-friendly option that offers decent reliability for its class. The 1.6L engine and manual transmission are generally robust. However, potential buyers should be aware of possible issues with the CVT transmission, which can exhibit hesitation or jerking. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and power windows, are also noted concerns. While the suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread technical defects, the CVT and electrical systems are the primary areas to monitor for potential repairs. Overall, it's a reliable choice if these specific potential issues are addressed or if the vehicle has a history of proper maintenance.
