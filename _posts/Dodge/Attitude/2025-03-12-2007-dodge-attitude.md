The 2007 Dodge Attitude was a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets. It was essentially a rebadged Hyundai Accent. The Attitude was known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. However, it wasn't particularly lauded for its performance or build quality. Common complaints included a lack of power, especially with the smaller engine, and the basic interior. Engine options included a 1.4-liter gasoline engine that produced 95 horsepower and a 1.6-liter gasoline engine that produced 110 horsepower. Transmissions were either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine.

**Engine**

**1.4L Gasoline Engine**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly, especially at idle or low speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: Check and clean the throttle body. Replace the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve if cleaning doesn't resolve the issue. Also, check for vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Gasoline Engine**

*   **Check Engine Light Due to Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, often accompanied by a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) indicating a problem with one or more of the oxygen sensors. Reduced fuel economy may also be noticed.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor(s). Usually it is the upstream or downstream sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts between gears, especially from 1st to 2nd.
    *   Solution: Begin by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. Perform a transmission fluid and filter change. If the issue persists, consider a transmission flush and adding a transmission additive designed to improve shifting. In some cases, valve body work or replacement might be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported faster than expected wear of front suspension components, such as ball joints, tie rod ends, and sway bar links. This can manifest as clunking noises, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Regularly inspect suspension components and replace worn parts as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Switch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working intermittently or completely. The switch itself is often the culprit.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $30 - $100+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The climate control fan only works on certain settings, or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handles Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exterior door handles are prone to breaking, particularly in cold weather or with frequent use.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per handle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light is illuminated on the dashboard. A diagnostic scan may reveal codes related to the clock spring in the steering wheel or other airbag system components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause using a scan tool. If the clock spring is faulty, replace it. Inspect and repair any other airbag system issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Dodge Attitude, while economical, has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine stalling and oxygen sensor failures can be frustrating, while transmission issues might require more extensive repairs. Premature wear of suspension components and electrical problems like window switch failures can also add to the ownership cost. The breaking exterior door handles can be an annoyance. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially more costly repairs.
