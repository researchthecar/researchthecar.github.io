The 2019 Dodge Attitude is a subcompact sedan primarily sold in the Mexican market. It's known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior relative to its size. However, some drivers find its performance underwhelming and its features basic. The 2019 Attitude typically comes with a 1.2-liter inline-4 engine producing around 76 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). This analysis will focus on common issues reported for this configuration.

**Engine**

**1.2L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the issue may be related to faulty valve stem seals or worn piston rings. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the root cause. Depending on the diagnosis, the solution could range from replacing valve stem seals to overhauling the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occasional engine misfires, particularly under load, have been reported. This can lead to rough idling, reduced power, and a blinking check engine light. The vehicle will run rough.
    *   Solution: Troubleshooting steps include checking the spark plugs, ignition coils, and fuel injectors. A faulty sensor, such as the crankshaft position sensor or camshaft position sensor, could also be the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience jerky shifting or hesitation, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. This is especially pronounced at low speeds.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and replacement may improve the situation. In more severe cases, the CVT may require a rebuild or replacement. Ensure the correct CVT fluid is used.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners find it difficult to shift into certain gears, often first or reverse. This can be accompanied by grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Inspect the clutch linkage, clutch cable, and clutch master cylinder for any signs of wear or damage. The clutch itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear in suspension components, particularly the front struts and stabilizer bar links, have surfaced. Symptoms include clunking noises over bumps and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn components with updated parts. Consider aftermarket upgrades for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, leading to a dead battery, especially if the vehicle sits unused for a few days.
    *   Solution: A parasitic draw test can help identify the source of the battery drain. Common culprits include faulty door switches, aftermarket accessories, or a malfunctioning electrical module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Power Windows**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure or slow operation of the power windows.
    *   Solution: Check the power window motor, regulator, and associated wiring. Replacement of faulty components is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poor Quality Door Handles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced door handles, particularly the exterior door handles, breaking prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replacement with new door handles, potentially opting for aftermarket options with improved durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight, is reported.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard, although often cost-prohibitive. Dashboard covers are a more affordable alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Dodge Attitude, while budget-friendly, has its share of common issues. Engine-related problems, such as excessive oil consumption, and transmission quirks, especially with the CVT, seem to be the most significant concerns. Suspension wear and electrical glitches also appear with some frequency. While the cost of repairs can vary, some of these issues can become relatively expensive to resolve. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used 2019 Attitude before purchase.
