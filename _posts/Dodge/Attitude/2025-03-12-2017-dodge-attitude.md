The 2017 Dodge Attitude, primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets, is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. The 2017 model year was available with a 1.2-liter inline-4 engine producing around 76 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque or a 1.4-liter inline-4 engine producing around 100 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often appreciate the vehicle's low running costs and compact size, making it suitable for urban environments. Common complaints revolve around the relatively low power output, basic interior features, and limited availability of parts and service outside its primary markets.

**Engine**

**1.2L Inline-4**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups. This can manifest as low oil level warnings, visible blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and use of the manufacturer-recommended oil type are important. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Inline-4**
* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can result in rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and a noticeable loss of power. The check engine light may illuminate with codes indicating misfires in specific cylinders.
    * Solution: Diagnose the cause of the misfire, which could include faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors. Replace the affected components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**
* **Difficulty Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported difficulty engaging gears, particularly first and second. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: Check and adjust the clutch cable. If the problem persists, inspect the shift linkage and the synchronizers within the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
* **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Uneven or jerky acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Hesitation or a delay in response when accelerating.
    * Solution: Ensure the correct CVT fluid is used and perform regular fluid changes as recommended by the manufacturer. If the issue persists, a CVT valve body issue or complete transmission replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Knocking or clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Uneven tire wear and poor handling. Common components affected include struts, shocks, and control arm bushings.
    * Solution: Inspect suspension components for wear or damage. Replace worn struts, shocks, and bushings as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Failure of Power Windows/Locks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows and/or door locks. This could affect one or multiple windows/locks.
    * Solution: Check the wiring and connections to the affected components. Replace faulty window motors, door lock actuators, or associated switches.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per component
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or over a short period, preventing the car from starting.
    * Solution: Test the battery and alternator. If both are good, check for parasitic draws in the electrical system. Common causes include faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or a malfunctioning charging system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture accumulates inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the bulbs.
    * Solution: Check the headlight housing seals for damage. Replacing the seals or the entire headlight assembly might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blows warm air or no air at all.
    * Solution: Check the refrigerant level, compressor, and other A/C components. Recharge the system, repair leaks, or replace faulty parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Dodge Attitude presents a mix of potential issues ranging from minor inconveniences to more significant repairs. Engine misfires, transmission issues (especially with the CVT), and suspension wear seem to be the most common complaints. While some repairs like replacing spark plugs or bushings are relatively inexpensive, CVT repairs or engine work can be considerably costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase.
