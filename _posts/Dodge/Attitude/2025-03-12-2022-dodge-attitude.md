The 2022 Dodge Attitude, primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets, is a subcompact sedan known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It's essentially a rebadged Mitsubishi Mirage G4. The most common engine is a 1.2-liter inline-3 cylinder engine producing around 76 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque. It is available with either a 5-speed manual or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners typically appreciate its low price point, compact size for city driving, and good gas mileage. Common dislikes include its underpowered engine, basic interior, and limited features compared to other vehicles in its class.
