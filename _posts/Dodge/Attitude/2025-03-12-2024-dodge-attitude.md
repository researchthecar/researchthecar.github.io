The 2024 Dodge Attitude, essentially a rebadged Mitsubishi Mirage G4, is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It comes standard with a 1.2-liter inline-3 engine producing 76 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While praised for its low price and good gas mileage, owners often find the performance lacking and the interior basic. Common complaints revolve around the small engine's lack of power, especially when accelerating or climbing hills, and the CVT's tendency to drone. The car is appreciated by those seeking inexpensive transportation, but those prioritizing performance or a refined driving experience may be disappointed.
