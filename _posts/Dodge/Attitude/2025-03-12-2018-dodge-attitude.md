The 2018 Dodge Attitude is a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets. It is essentially a rebadged Mitsubishi Mirage G4. The 2018 Attitude comes with a 1.2-liter inline-3 gasoline engine producing around 76 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque. It is available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Attitude for its fuel efficiency and affordability. However, it's often criticized for its lack of power, basic interior, and limited features. Due to its regional market focus, reliable and comprehensive data on common issues can be challenging to gather compared to vehicles sold in larger markets like the US or Europe. The following information is based on available data and user reports.

**Engine**

**1.2L Inline-3 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every few thousand kilometers and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels, use of the correct viscosity oil, and potentially inspection for leaks or engine wear by a qualified mechanic. In severe cases, engine repair or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported excessive vibration coming from the engine, especially at idle or low speeds.
    *   Solution: Inspect engine mounts and replace if necessary. Also check for any loose components around the engine bay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hesitation or jerking during acceleration, especially from a standstill or at low speeds. This can be due to issues with the CVT's control system or wear within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Check and replace the CVT fluid. If the problem persists, the CVT may need to be inspected by a transmission specialist for potential repairs or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear in suspension bushings, leading to noises (clunking, squeaking) and reduced handling precision.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings with new ones. Inspecting ball joints and tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the car is not driven regularly. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or a weak battery.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested and replace if necessary. Perform a parasitic draw test to identify any components that are draining the battery while the car is off.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+

**Summary:**

The 2018 Dodge Attitude, while appreciated for its fuel economy and affordability, can present owners with several potential issues. The most commonly reported problems revolve around the engine (oil consumption, vibration), transmission (CVT hesitation), suspension (bushing wear), and electrical system (battery drain). The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. Addressing these concerns with proactive maintenance and timely repairs can help maintain the reliability and longevity of the vehicle.
