The 2010 Dodge Attitude, primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets, is a sedan based on the Hyundai Accent/Verna platform. The most common engine option was a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 110 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Attitude for its fuel efficiency and affordability. Common complaints revolve around its basic features, somewhat unrefined driving experience, and relatively low power output.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage. Blue smoke from the exhaust is another indicator.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution can range from using a higher viscosity oil, replacing valve stem seals, or ultimately, a complete engine rebuild to address worn piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (high viscosity oil) - $2500+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter can fail prematurely, leading to a check engine light (typically P0420 code - Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold). This results in poor emissions and potential performance issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. It is also important to diagnose and fix any underlying issues that may have caused the failure, such as a faulty oxygen sensor or engine running rich.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission exhibits harsh or abrupt shifting between gears. This can be noticeable during both upshifts and downshifts, making the driving experience uncomfortable.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may help in some cases. If the problem persists, it could indicate a problem with the valve body or solenoids inside the transmission. Replacement or rebuild of the transmission may be needed in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $1500+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging certain gears, particularly first or reverse. This can be accompanied by grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Could be due to worn clutch components (clutch disc, pressure plate, throw-out bearing), or a linkage adjustment issue. Replacing the clutch assembly is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and longer stopping distances. Visible leaks from the shock absorbers/struts are also a sign.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn shock absorbers/struts. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear) for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 (per pair, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Sway Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (per pair, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows may stop working, move slowly, or make grinding noises. This is often due to a failing window regulator motor or damaged cables.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 (per window)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery frequently drains overnight or after the car has been sitting for a short period. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty electrical component.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various circuits and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture builds up inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlights and dry out the inside. Seal any cracks or openings in the housing to prevent moisture from re-entering. In severe cases, headlight replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (DIY sealing) / $100 - $300+ (headlight replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blows warm air or doesn't cool effectively. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a clogged evaporator core.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the air conditioning system. This may involve recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, or cleaning/replacing the evaporator core.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Interior Door Handles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Interior door handles break easily, making it difficult to open the doors from the inside.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the interior door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (per door)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Dodge Attitude, while economical, exhibits several common issues. Engine problems like oil consumption and catalytic converter failure can be costly. Transmission issues, particularly with harsh shifting in the automatic, affect drivability. Suspension wear is typical for a vehicle of this age. Electrical problems, such as faulty window regulators, and interior issues like weak AC and door handles, also contribute to owner complaints. The severity and cost of these issues range from minor repairs to potentially expensive engine or transmission work. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have a mechanic inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchase.
