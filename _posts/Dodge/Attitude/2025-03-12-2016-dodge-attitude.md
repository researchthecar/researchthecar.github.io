The 2016 Dodge Attitude is a subcompact sedan primarily sold in the Mexican market. It's known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. Engine options include a 1.2-liter inline-4 engine producing approximately 76 horsepower and 73 lb-ft of torque and a 1.4-liter inline-4 engine producing approximately 100 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque. The 1.2L engine is paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, while the 1.4L engine could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often appreciate its low price point and fuel economy, but common complaints revolve around its basic interior, lack of modern features, and somewhat underpowered engines, especially when fully loaded.

**Engine**

**1.2L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Signs include visible oil spots under the car and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Inline-4**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine light on, codes pointing to catalytic converter inefficiency (e.g., P0420), decreased fuel economy, and a sulfur smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Hard Shifting/Grinding Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting into gear, grinding noises when shifting, especially from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: Could be due to worn synchros, damaged shift forks, or low transmission fluid.  Replacement or repair of the affected components is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on severity
    * Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT may exhibit jerky acceleration, hesitation, or a lack of power, especially when trying to accelerate quickly.  "Rubber banding" feeling is also common.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid flush *may* resolve minor issues.  In more severe cases, the CVT may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 for fluid flush, $2,000 - $4,000+ for rebuild/replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps.  Poor handling and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures (Oxygen Sensors, Crankshaft Position Sensor)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine light on, poor fuel economy, rough running engine, stalling. Diagnostic codes will point to the specific sensor failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle won't start after sitting for a short period, requiring a jump start.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory). Repair or replace the offending component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlight assembly, resealing the existing assembly (less reliable).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per headlight assembly
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air blowing from the vents.  Possible causes include refrigerant leaks, compressor failure, or a faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Recharge the A/C system, repair leaks, replace the compressor, or replace the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2016 Dodge Attitude, while affordable and fuel-efficient, does present some common issues. The severity of these issues ranges from minor (sensor failures, bushing wear) to more significant (CVT problems, catalytic converter failure). The cost to address these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, particularly if the CVT requires replacement. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have a thorough inspection performed before purchasing a used 2016 Dodge Attitude.
