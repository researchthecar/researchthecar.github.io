### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Dodge Attitude, while an economical choice, presents a few common areas of concern that owners should be aware of. The 1.6L engine can experience ignition coil issues and oil leaks from the valve cover gasket. Automatic transmissions may develop slipping problems or TCM failures, while manual transmissions are susceptible to clutch wear. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical problems, particularly with window regulators and instrument clusters, are also reported. Exteriorly, headlight hazing is common. Interiorly, the HVAC blower motor is a frequent point of failure. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the Attitude to be a reliable vehicle when these common problems are addressed proactively.
