The 2011 Dodge Attitude is a subcompact sedan, primarily sold in Mexico and Latin America, and is essentially a rebadged Hyundai Accent. The Attitude was favored for its fuel efficiency and affordability, making it a practical choice for urban driving. However, it has been criticized for its relatively basic features and performance compared to some competitors. Engine options for the 2011 Attitude included a 1.4-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 97 horsepower and approximately 94 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**1.4L Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Check for leaks, replace PCV valve, perform compression test to evaluate the piston rings. If rings are worn, engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rough Idle**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine idles roughly, which can be caused by a faulty idle air control valve. Other potential causes can be vacuum leaks, dirty throttle body, or malfunctioning sensors.
    * Solution: Diagnose the root cause and replace the faulty component or clean the dirty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough or jerky shifting between gears, particularly from 1st to 2nd. This can indicate internal wear or issues with the valve body.
    * Solution: Fluid change, valve body repair or replacement, or complete transmission rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have noted accelerated wear of suspension bushings (especially control arm bushings), leading to clunking noises and imprecise handling.
    * Solution: Replace worn bushings with new ones, preferably high-quality aftermarket options.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sensor Failures (Oxygen Sensors, Crankshaft Position Sensor)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning sensors (specifically oxygen sensors and crankshaft position sensor) causing engine performance issues, such as poor fuel economy, stalling, or check engine light illumination.
    * Solution: Diagnose with an OBDII scanner, replace the faulty sensor with an OEM or equivalent aftermarket part.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Window Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent operation or failure of power windows. Sometimes the window motor fails or the regulator is not aligned properly.
    * Solution: Replace faulty window motor or regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight/Taillight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture build-up inside headlight and taillight housings, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the bulbs.
    * Solution: Remove the light housing, dry out the moisture, and reseal the housing with silicone sealant. Replacement may be needed if the housing is damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracking of the dashboard material, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement or using a dashboard cover to protect it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Dodge Attitude, while appreciated for its fuel efficiency and affordability, presents owners with several potential issues. Engine-related problems like excessive oil consumption and rough idle can be concerning and potentially costly to repair. The automatic transmission may exhibit harsh shifting, while suspension components can wear prematurely. Electrical issues with sensors and power windows are also common. Interior issues such as dashboard cracking may detract from the vehicle's overall appeal. The severity and cost of these repairs vary, but addressing them proactively can extend the life of the vehicle.
