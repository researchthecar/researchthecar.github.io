# 2009 Dodge Attitude

### Overview
The 2009 Dodge Attitude, a subcompact sedan, offered a generally reliable ownership experience for its segment. It was based on the Mitsubishi Lancer platform, inheriting some of its mechanical robustness. Common engine options provided decent fuel economy and adequate performance for daily commuting. While not a performance-oriented vehicle, its straightforward design contributed to fewer complex failure points. Owners generally reported satisfaction with its day-to-day usability and relatively low running costs. However, like many vehicles of its age, certain components could experience wear over time, particularly in the suspension and electrical systems, though widespread critical failures were not a dominant theme in owner feedback.
