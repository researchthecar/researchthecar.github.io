        * Solution: Replace valve cover gasket.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
        * Recalls: None Found
    * **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Defective intake manifold gasket can cause vacuum leaks, leading to poor engine performance, rough idle, and reduced fuel efficiency.
        * Solution: Replace intake manifold gasket.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
        * Recalls: None Found
    * **Timing Chain Guide Wear:** Premature wear on the timing chain guide can lead to a stretched timing chain, causing misfires, engine noise, and potential engine damage.
        * Solution: Replace timing chain guide and tensioner.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
        * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

* **5-Speed Manual Transmission**
    * **Clutch Slave Cylinder Failure:** Faulty clutch slave cylinder can result in loss of clutch pressure, making it difficult or impossible to shift gears.
        * Solution: Replace clutch slave cylinder.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
        * Recalls: None Found
    * **Shifter Linkage Issues:** Shifter linkage components can wear out, causing loose or difficult shifting.
        * Solution: Replace shifter linkage bushings or linkage components.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
        * Recalls: None Found
* **4-Speed Automatic Transmission**
    * **Transmission Fluid Leak:** Leaks can occur from various seals and gaskets in the transmission, leading to low fluid levels and transmission damage.
        * Solution: Repair or replace leaking components.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
        * Recalls: None Found
    * **Solenoid Failure:** Solenoids can fail, causing erratic shifting, transmission slipping, or inability to shift gears.
        * Solution: Replace faulty solenoids.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+
        * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Noises:** Noises from the rear suspension, such as squeaks, rattles, or clunks, can indicate worn suspension components.
    * Solution: Diagnose and replace worn suspension components, such as bushings, springs, or struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Front Strut Failure:** Premature failure of front struts can lead to poor handling, excessive tire wear, and reduced ride comfort.
    * Solution: Replace front struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Excessive battery drain can be caused by parasitic electrical devices or faulty charging system components.
    * Solution: Identify and disconnect or repair faulty electrical components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Electrical Shorts:** Short circuits in the electrical system can blow fuses or damage electrical components.
    * Solution: Locate and repair short circuits in the wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Door Handle Failure:** Door handles can break or malfunction, making it difficult or impossible to open the doors.
