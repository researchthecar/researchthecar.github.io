The 2006 Dodge Attitude, a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico, was known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It was offered with a 1.6L 4-cylinder engine that produced around 110 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, and a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the car's economical nature and easy maneuverability in urban environments. However, common complaints revolved around its somewhat lackluster performance, basic interior, and less refined ride compared to some competitors.
