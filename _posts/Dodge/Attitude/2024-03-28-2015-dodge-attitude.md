**Introduction**

The 2015 Dodge Attitude is a subcompact sedan that offers a choice of two engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 1.6-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder that produces 108 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque, paired with a five-speed manual transmission. The optional engine is a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that produces 138 horsepower and 142 lb-ft of torque, mated to a CVT.
