The 2014 Dodge Attitude is a subcompact sedan, primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets. It's known for its fuel efficiency and affordability, making it a popular choice for budget-conscious buyers. However, it has been criticized for its basic features, lackluster performance, and some reliability issues. The 2014 Attitude primarily came with a 1.6L four-cylinder engine, producing around 105 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil regularly, blueish exhaust smoke, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: In some cases, switching to a higher viscosity oil can help reduce consumption. More severe cases may require an engine rebuild or replacement of piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly while driving, especially at low speeds or when idling.
    *   Solution: The issue can be caused by a faulty idle air control valve, a dirty throttle body, or a malfunctioning crankshaft position sensor. Cleaning the throttle body, replacing the faulty sensor, or updating the engine control unit (ECU) software might solve the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed gear changes, slipping between gears, and overall poor shifting quality.
    * Solution: A transmission flush and fluid change may help in some cases. However, this issue can also be a sign of internal wear or damage, potentially requiring a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Complete loss of transmission function, inability to shift gears, or loud clunking noises from the transmission.
    * Solution: Requires full transmission replacement or rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that bushings, ball joints, and shock absorbers wear out more quickly than expected, leading to a bumpy ride and poor handling. Unusual noises from the suspension when driving over bumps can also occur.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components. This may involve replacing individual parts like bushings and ball joints or replacing entire assemblies.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per axle
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate or become stuck, often due to a failing window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain quickly, leading to difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve replacing a faulty sensor, module, or other electrical component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with headlights being too dim, flickering, or failing prematurely. This can be related to the headlight bulbs themselves, wiring issues, or problems with the headlight switch.
    * Solution: Replacement of the bulbs or repair of the wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may blow warm air or fail to cool the cabin effectively. This can be due to a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blower motor.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the faulty component. This may involve recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, or replacing the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
