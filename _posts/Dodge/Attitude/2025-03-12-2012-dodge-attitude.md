Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2012 Dodge Attitude, categorized by major component. The 2012 Dodge Attitude was primarily sold in Mexico and certain other markets and is mechanically similar to the Hyundai Accent of the same era. It offered a balance of affordability and fuel efficiency, making it a popular choice for budget-conscious buyers. However, some owners have reported concerns about its reliability and build quality. The available engines were a 1.4L I4 producing around 105 hp and 94 lb-ft of torque and a 1.6L I4 with around 110 hp and 106 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Drivers appreciated the car's fuel economy and compact size, but disliked its somewhat basic interior and perceived lack of refinement.

**Engine**

**1.4L I4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, check engine light illuminated. Often caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.

    *   Solution: In some cases, switching to a higher viscosity oil can help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
