# 2013 Dodge Attitude

### Overview
The 2013 Dodge Attitude, a subcompact sedan, generally presented a mixed bag of reliability. While its core mechanical components often proved durable for the price point, certain areas showed a propensity for issues that owners should be aware of. The vehicle's design, often shared with other global platforms, meant that some components were more robust than others. Owners reported a range of concerns, from minor electrical glitches to more significant powertrain-related problems, particularly as the vehicle aged. Maintenance history and driving conditions significantly influenced the long-term reliability of individual units. This analysis focuses on documented common failures beyond routine maintenance.

### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Dodge Attitude, while an economical choice, exhibits common reliability concerns typical of its segment and age. Engine oil leaks and cooling system issues are frequently reported for the 1.4L, while the 1.6L can experience timing chain problems. Automatic transmissions may develop harsh shifting or leaks. Suspension components like ball joints and struts are also noted wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster issues, can arise. Exterior rust, particularly in certain climates, and interior HVAC blower motor failures are also points of concern. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential issues and ensuring longevity.
