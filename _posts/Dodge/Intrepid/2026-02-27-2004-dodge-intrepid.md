### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Dodge Intrepid presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.7L V6 engine is a notable weak point, prone to head gasket issues and oil sludge, necessitating vigilant maintenance. The 3.2L and 3.5L V6 engines are generally more robust. Transmission issues, particularly with the 42LE, can manifest as harsh shifting or slipping. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Electrical problems, often linked to the BCM, can cause frustrating intermittent issues. Exterior paint and interior upholstery can show age-related wear. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential pitfalls, especially concerning the engine and transmission, and factor in potential repair costs.
