### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Dodge Intrepid, while offering a comfortable ride, presents several common reliability concerns typical of vehicles from this era. The 2.7L and 3.2L V6 engines are particularly susceptible to head gasket failures and oil sludge issues, necessitating diligent maintenance and potentially costly repairs. Automatic transmission problems, such as harsh shifting and torque converter issues, are also frequently reported. Suspension components like ball joints and struts can wear out, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or instrument cluster, can manifest as various system malfunctions. Exterior paint and headlight clarity can also degrade over time. Interior climate control issues, specifically blend door actuators, are a common annoyance. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in maintenance and repair costs.
