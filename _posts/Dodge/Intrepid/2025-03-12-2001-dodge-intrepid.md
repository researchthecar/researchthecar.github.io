The 2001 Dodge Intrepid was a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior and distinctive styling. Engine options included a 2.7L V6 and a 3.2L/3.5L V6, both paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 2.7L produced approximately 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.2L/3.5L generated around 225-250 horsepower and 235-250 lb-ft of torque. People generally liked the Intrepid's comfortable ride and roomy cabin. Common dislikes included reliability concerns, particularly with the 2.7L engine, and build quality issues.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Sludge Buildup and Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L engine is notorious for sludge buildup due to its oiling system design. This can lead to oil starvation, overheating, and ultimately, engine failure. Symptoms include a knocking noise from the engine, low oil pressure, and the "check engine" light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Prevention is key. Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and OEM filters are essential. If sludge buildup is already present, engine flushing may provide temporary relief, but engine replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+ for engine replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump is located internally and driven by the timing chain. If it fails, coolant can leak into the engine oil, causing severe damage. Symptoms include coolant loss, overheating, and a milky appearance in the oil.
    *   Solution: Replacing the water pump requires significant engine disassembly, often including the timing chain. Engine replacement might be more cost-effective if the engine is already damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L/3.5L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (42LE)**

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 42LE transmission can experience issues with hard shifting, slipping, or complete failure. These issues can stem from worn valve bodies, damaged solenoids, or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the transmission may require a valve body replacement, solenoid replacement, or a complete rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ for rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks can wear out over time, resulting in a bouncy or unstable ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks will restore the vehicle's ride quality and handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ for parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Coil Springs**
    * Description/Symptoms: The coil springs can corrode and break, especially in areas with harsh winters. This can cause the vehicle to sit unevenly and result in a rough ride.
    * Solution: Replacing the broken coil spring will restore the vehicle's ride height and handling. It is generally recommended to replace coil springs in pairs to ensure balanced suspension performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$700+ for parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working due to faulty window motors, regulators, or switches.
    *   Solution: Replacing the malfunctioning component will restore power window operation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster can experience issues such as flickering lights, inaccurate readings, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: The instrument cluster may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ for repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can occur on the body panels, especially in areas with harsh winters.
    *   Solution: Repair rust holes with new metal. Remove surface rust and seal the area with rust preventative paint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner material can detach from the backing board, causing it to sag.
    *   Solution: The headliner will need to be replaced or repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack and warp due to prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat.
    *   Solution: The dashboard will need to be replaced or covered with a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Dodge Intrepid is plagued by a number of issues, the most significant being the engine problems, particularly with the 2.7L V6. Sludge buildup can lead to catastrophic engine failure, resulting in high repair costs. The 42LE transmission is also prone to issues, potentially requiring costly rebuilds or replacements. Other common problems include suspension wear, electrical issues, and interior degradation. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from moderate to severe, and the cost to repair them can be substantial.
