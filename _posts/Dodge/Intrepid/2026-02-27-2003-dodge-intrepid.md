### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Dodge Intrepid presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.7L V6 engine is a notable weak point, prone to head gasket issues and oil sludge, necessitating careful maintenance or avoidance. The 3.2L and 3.5L V6 engines are generally more robust. Transmission issues, particularly with the 42LE, can include harsh shifting and overheating. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Exterior paint degradation and interior HVAC resistor failures are also reported. Despite these potential problems, many issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, especially for those with the more reliable engine options.
