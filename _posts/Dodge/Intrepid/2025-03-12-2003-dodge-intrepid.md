The 2003 Dodge Intrepid, a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride, offered three engine options. The 2.7L DOHC 24-valve V6 engine produced 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, the 3.2L SOHC 18-valve V6 engine produced 225 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.5L SOHC 24-valve V6 engine produced 242 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciated the Intrepid's roomy cabin and smooth highway cruising. Common complaints included reliability issues and subpar fuel economy.

**Engine**

**2.7L DOHC 24-Valve V6**

* **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks, engine knocking, and potentially catastrophic engine damage. The water pump is driven by the timing chain, and failure can lead to timing chain failure and internal engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the water pump and timing chain components. If engine damage has occurred, a complete engine replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ depending on the extent of the damage
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Sludge Buildup**
    * Description/Symptoms: Due to a design flaw with the oiling system, the 2.7L engine is prone to oil sludge buildup, especially if oil changes are not performed regularly. This can lead to clogged oil passages, oil starvation, and engine failure. Symptoms include engine knocking, rough idling, and low oil pressure.
    * Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil can help prevent sludge buildup. If sludge is already present, an engine flush may help, but in severe cases, engine disassembly and cleaning or engine replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (engine flush) - $2500+ (engine replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.2L SOHC 18-Valve V6**
    * No Issues Found

**3.5L SOHC 24-Valve V6**
    * No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (42LE)**

* **Shifting Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. The transmission may also make unusual noises.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the transmission, which may involve replacing solenoids, valve body components, or rebuilding the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (solenoid replacement) - $2500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and uneven tire wear. Leaking fluid from the struts or shocks may also be visible.
    * Solution: Replace worn struts or shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    * Solution: Replace worn sway bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Instrument Cluster Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gauges may stop working, flicker, or display inaccurate readings. The odometer or trip meter may also fail.
    * Solution: Replacement or repair of the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Window Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate, move slowly, or make grinding noises.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the power window motor, regulator, or switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the lower body panels, wheel wells, and undercarriage.
    * Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard due to sun exposure and age.
    * Solution: Dash replacement or a dash cover to conceal damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the complexity and labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2003 Dodge Intrepid presents some reliability concerns. The 2.7L engine is particularly susceptible to oil sludge and water pump failures, which can lead to expensive repairs. Transmission issues and suspension wear are also common. While other complaints are less severe, overall maintenance costs can be substantial, especially for models with the 2.7L engine. The severity of the issues range from moderate to critical, with the most costly issues related to engine failure.
