The 2002 Dodge Intrepid was a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior and distinctive styling. Engine options included a 2.7L V6 producing around 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 offering approximately 242 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the car's comfortable ride and roomy cabin, while common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the smaller 2.7L engine, as well as electrical problems.
