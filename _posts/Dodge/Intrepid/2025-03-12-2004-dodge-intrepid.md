Here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2004 Dodge Intrepid, organized by category and component, with specific details on symptoms, solutions, and estimated costs.

The 2004 Dodge Intrepid was a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior and sleek design. It offered a comfortable ride and decent handling for its class. The base engine was a 2.7L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Optional engines included a 3.2L V6 (234 hp, 232 lb-ft) and a 3.5L V6 (250 hp, 250 lb-ft). All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Intrepid's roomy cabin and distinctive styling. Common dislikes included reliability concerns and somewhat underwhelming fuel economy.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Sludge Buildup and Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L engine is notorious for sludge buildup due to its tight oil passages and a cooling system design that can cause overheating. Symptoms include ticking noises, oil pressure light illumination, rough running, and eventual engine failure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes (every 3,000 miles) with high-quality synthetic oil can help prevent sludge. If sludge is already present, engine flush treatments (with caution) or complete engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Engine replacement: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump is known to fail prematurely in the 2.7L engine, leading to overheating. Symptoms include coolant leaks, temperature gauge rising, and engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump. It's often recommended to replace the timing chain as well since the water pump is driven by it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L and 3.5L V6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets. Symptoms include burning oil smell, visible oil leaks on the engine, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **4-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping, harsh shifts, or failure to shift into certain gears. These can be caused by a failing transmission solenoid pack or worn valve body.
    *   Solution: Diagnose with a scanner to check for transmission codes. Replace the solenoid pack or valve body as needed. A complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be required in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Solenoid pack replacement: $300 - $600. Valve body replacement: $500 - $1000. Transmission rebuild/replacement: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut/Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Excessive bounce and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the front struts and strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (for both sides)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, and clunking noises from the rear.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (for both sides)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows that stop working or move slowly. Often caused by a broken or damaged window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to control the temperature of the air blowing from the vents, or air blowing from the wrong vents. This is often caused by a faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace the blend door actuator. This can be difficult due to its location.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding/Yellowing**
