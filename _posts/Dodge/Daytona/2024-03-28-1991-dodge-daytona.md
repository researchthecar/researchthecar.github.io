## 1991 Dodge Daytona

The 1991 Dodge Daytona was a front-wheel drive sports car offered in two trim levels: base and IROC. The base model was powered by a 2.5L inline-four engine producing 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, while the IROC model featured a 3.0L V6 engine producing 174 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Daytona was praised for its stylish design, handling, and performance, but it was also criticized for its cramped interior, poor fuel economy, and limited rear visibility.
