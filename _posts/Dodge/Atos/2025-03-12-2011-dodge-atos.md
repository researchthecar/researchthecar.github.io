Okay, I can provide you with a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2011 Dodge Atos, categorized by major components and adhering to your specified format.

The 2011 Dodge Atos, while sold under the Dodge brand in some markets (specifically Mexico), is essentially a rebadged Hyundai i10. It was designed as a small, fuel-efficient city car. The primary engine option was a 1.1-liter inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 62 horsepower and 72 lb-ft of torque. Some of the things people like about the car are the small size making it easy to drive in tight city environments and its fuel efficiency. Dislikes include the extremely small size, the anemic power output and handling. The only transmission option available for the 2011 Dodge Atos was a 5-speed manual.
