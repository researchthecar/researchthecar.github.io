### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Dodge Atos, while a budget-friendly option, exhibits common reliability concerns for its age and class. Owners should be aware of potential issues with the cooling system, ignition components, and clutch wear on manual transmissions. Automatic transmissions may experience harsh shifting. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also noted areas for potential wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly alternator failure and window regulators, can arise. Exterior rust is a significant concern, especially in certain climates, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor can fail. Despite these points, many Atos models have served reliably with proper maintenance, but buyers should factor in potential repair costs for these known issues.
