### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Dodge Atos, while economical, exhibits some common reliability concerns, particularly within its powertrain and electrical systems. Engine issues like cooling system leaks and oil leaks are frequently reported for the 1.0L and 1.1L variants, with the timing belt on the 1.1L being a critical failure point. Transmission problems, such as clutch wear in manuals and harsh shifting in automatics, also require attention.
