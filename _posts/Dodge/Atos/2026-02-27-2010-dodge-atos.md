The manual transmission is also a reliable choice. However, the automated manual transmission has been noted for potential clutch actuator failures, which can be a significant repair. Electrical issues, particularly alternator failures and power window malfunctions, are also areas to monitor. Exterior and interior components appear to be relatively trouble-free from a technical reliability standpoint, excluding normal wear. Overall, while the Atos can be an economical choice, potential buyers should be aware of the specific transmission and electrical concerns.
