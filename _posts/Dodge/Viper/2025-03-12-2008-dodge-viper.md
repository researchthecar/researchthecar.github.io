The 2008 Dodge Viper is a powerful sports car known for its raw performance and iconic styling. It came equipped with a single engine option: an 8.4-liter V10 engine producing a staggering 600 horsepower and 560 lb-ft of torque. A defining characteristic of the Viper is its aggressive handling and visceral driving experience, often praised by enthusiasts. However, its stiff ride, limited practicality, and high running costs are often cited as drawbacks. The 2008 Viper was offered exclusively with a Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission.
