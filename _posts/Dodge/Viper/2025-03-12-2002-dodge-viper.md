The 2002 Dodge Viper is a high-performance sports car known for its powerful engine and aggressive styling. The 2002 model year was part of the second generation (commonly referred to as the SRII or Gen 2). The Viper came with a single engine option: an 8.0-liter V10 engine producing around 450 horsepower and 490 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission offered was a six-speed manual. People loved the Viper for its raw power, distinctive looks, and thrilling driving experience. However, some disliked its lack of driver aids, challenging handling, and somewhat crude interior.
