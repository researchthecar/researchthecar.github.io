### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Dodge Viper, while a marvel of automotive engineering, demands specialized attention. Its 8.4L V10 engine is generally robust but can suffer from cooling system and oil cooler leaks, requiring significant repair costs. The 6-speed manual transmission, while a purist's delight, can experience issues with clutch actuators and internal synchronizers, leading to costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or infotainment system, are not uncommon and can be frustrating. Exterior carbon fiber panels may show wear on their clear coat, and interior upholstery, particularly Alcantara, can degrade with aggressive use. These issues, while not universal, are characteristic of a high-performance, low-volume exotic vehicle and necessitate a budget for potential specialized maintenance and repairs.
