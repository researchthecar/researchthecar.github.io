The 2004 Dodge Viper is a raw and powerful sports car known for its aggressive styling and exhilarating performance. The only engine option was an 8.3L V10 engine producing 500 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option was a Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise the Viper for its iconic design, incredible acceleration, and visceral driving experience. However, some common complaints include the car's extreme heat management, challenging handling, and limited practicality as a daily driver.
