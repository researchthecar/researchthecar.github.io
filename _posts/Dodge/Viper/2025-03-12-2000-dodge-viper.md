The 2000 Dodge Viper RT/10 and GTS are iconic American sports cars, known for their raw power and aggressive styling. The heart of the beast is an 8.0-liter V10 engine, producing a staggering 450 horsepower and 490 lb-ft of torque. All models came exclusively with a Tremec T-56 six-speed manual transmission. People are drawn to the Viper's visceral driving experience, its bold design, and its status as a true performance icon. Common dislikes include the lack of modern amenities, a somewhat unforgiving ride, and, depending on the owner, the cost of ownership and maintenance.

**Engine**

**8.0L V10**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks often develop from various points on the engine, including valve covers, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil spots under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and seals is the standard fix. Properly torquing bolts during reassembly is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the source and complexity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Issues (Early Production)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some early production 8.0L V10s (specifically those from the first couple of years) experienced valve spring failures. This could lead to rough running, misfires, and potentially more serious engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve springs with updated parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ depending on labor and if any further damage occurred.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Compartment Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine bay has a tendency to get excessively hot. This can damage components over time and result in performance loss.
    *   Solution: Installation of hood vents, improving cooling system, or heat wrapping exhaust components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Tremec T-56 6-Speed Manual**

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Tremec T-56 transmission, while robust, is prone to synchro wear, especially in 2nd and 3rd gear. Symptoms include grinding when shifting into these gears, difficulty engaging the gear, or popping out of gear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn synchros and potentially other associated components like sliders and hubs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the damage and if a complete rebuild is required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Original clutch assemblies may wear prematurely, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping, difficulty shifting, and clutch chatter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+ depending on the clutch kit used and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Bushings Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The suspension bushings, especially those in the control arms and sway bar, can wear and deteriorate over time. This results in loose handling, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings with new OEM or aftermarket polyurethane bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on how many bushings need replacement and the type of bushings used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as the crank position sensor, cam position sensor, and oxygen sensors, are prone to failure. This can lead to poor engine performance, check engine lights, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the sensor and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Module Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABS module can fail, resulting in the ABS light illuminating and the ABS system not functioning.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the ABS module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+ depending on whether the module can be repaired or needs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Hazing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlight lenses can become hazy and yellowed over time, reducing visibility.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the HVAC system, including blower motor failure, blend door actuator issues (resulting in inconsistent temperature), and refrigerant leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty components or repairing leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the specific issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Dodge Viper, while a thrilling performance car, has its share of potential issues. Engine oil leaks and synchro wear are common and can be relatively expensive to address.
