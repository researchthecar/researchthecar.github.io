The 2016 Dodge Viper is a raw, powerful, and iconic American sports car. The sole engine option is an 8.4-liter naturally aspirated V10 engine producing 645 horsepower and 600 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with a Tremec TR6060 six-speed manual transmission. Owners love the Viper for its incredible performance, unique styling, and visceral driving experience. Common dislikes include the car's harsh ride, limited practicality, and challenging handling.
