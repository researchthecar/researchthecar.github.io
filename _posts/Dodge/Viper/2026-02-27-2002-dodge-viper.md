### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Dodge Viper is a high-performance machine where reliability is often secondary to its driving experience. While the core powertrain is robust, owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil and coolant leaks, and the specific 'spark plug blowout' problem common to V10 engines of this era. Transmission components, particularly the clutch and synchronizers, can require attention due to the car's performance nature.
