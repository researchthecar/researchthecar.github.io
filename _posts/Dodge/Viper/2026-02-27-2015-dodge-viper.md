### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Dodge Viper, while a potent performance machine, exhibits a reliability profile consistent with its high-strung nature. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the powertrain, specifically the cooling system and potential wear on the clutch and transmission internals due to its manual-only, high-torque application. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, can also arise. However, for a vehicle of this caliber, these issues are not necessarily indicative of poor build quality but rather the demands placed upon specialized performance components. Regular, diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly are key to maintaining the Viper's reliability and performance.
