### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Dodge Viper, while a performance icon, exhibits some common issues typical of high-performance vehicles of its era. The V10 engine, though powerful, can be prone to oil leaks and spark plug issues, requiring attention. The manual transmission, while robust, may eventually need clutch replacements or internal repairs. Electrical components like window regulators and headlight switches can also present minor annoyances. However, the suspension and exterior generally hold up well. Interior wear, particularly on seat bolsters, is also a common cosmetic concern. Owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with these specific issues, especially if purchasing a higher-mileage example.
