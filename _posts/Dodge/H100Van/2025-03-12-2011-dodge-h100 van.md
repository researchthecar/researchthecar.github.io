The 2011 Dodge H100 Van, also known as the Hyundai H100 or Starex in some markets (as Dodge rebadged it), is a light commercial vehicle offering practicality and versatility for cargo and passenger transport. It was available with a 2.4L gasoline engine and a 2.5L diesel engine. The 2.4L gasoline engine produced around 110-125 horsepower and torque depending on the specific market. The 2.5L diesel engine produced around 80-100 horsepower and torque depending on the specific market. Owners generally appreciate its spacious interior and affordability, but some common dislikes include its basic features, somewhat underpowered engines, and ride quality.
