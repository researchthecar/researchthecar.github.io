Okay, here's the requested breakdown of common issues for the 2000 Dodge Ramcharger.

It's crucial to remember that the 2000 Dodge Ramcharger *was not sold in North America*. Production for North America ended in 1993. You are most likely referencing the Ramcharger sold in Mexico. These models, while bearing the Ramcharger name, share many components with the Dodge Ram pickup trucks of the era. The information below assumes the Mexican-market 2000 Ramcharger. Common engine options include the 5.2L Magnum V8 (approximately 220 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque) and the 5.9L Magnum V8 (approximately 245 hp and 335 lb-ft of torque). Owners generally appreciate the Ramcharger's ruggedness, off-road capability, and simplicity. Common dislikes include poor fuel economy and dated interior.

**Summary**

The 2000 Dodge Ramcharger, specifically the Mexican-market version, is generally a reliable vehicle but suffers from common issues related to its age. Engine issues, particularly the plenum gasket leak and PCM problems, are prevalent and can lead to performance issues. Transmission problems can range from minor shifting issues to major rebuilds. Suspension components wear with age, and electrical issues are common. Rust is a concern, especially in areas with road salt. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs like transmission overhauls or extensive rust repair can be costly. Careful inspection and preventative maintenance are essential for maintaining these vehicles.
