Okay, here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2017 Dodge Vision, organized as you requested.

**Important Note:** The Dodge Vision is not a real vehicle. The closest vehicles would be the Dodge Dart, or the Dodge Neon (depending on the market). Because this is not a real vehicle, I have provided information for the 2017 Dodge Dart, as it is the closest existing vehicle. I have attempted to follow your exact formatting guidelines and provided information based on publicly available sources.

The 2017 Dodge Dart was a compact car offered in several trims and with a choice of three engines: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque, a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 184 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L and 2.4L engines were primarily paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.4L turbo engine could be had with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Dart's stylish exterior, comfortable ride, and available technology features. However, some criticized its sluggish acceleration, fuel economy that didn't always match expectations, and reported issues with reliability.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, decreased power, check engine light illumination. Can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. Diagnosis may require a mechanic to isolate the affected cylinder and component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the number of components needing replacement and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant level, overheating, coolant smell, visible coolant leaks around the engine. Can be caused by leaks in the coolant reservoir, hoses, or water pump.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak. This may involve replacing hoses, the coolant reservoir, or the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+ depending on the component needing replacement and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the turbocharger, loss of power, check engine light. This can be due to a failing turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil levels, the need to frequently add oil, blue smoke from the exhaust. This is often associated with piston ring issues.
    *   Solution: In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement of the piston rings may be necessary. In less severe cases, switching to a higher viscosity oil may help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (oil change) - $3000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting after refueling, rough idling, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (for 2.0L and 2.4L Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, the transmission slipping out of gear. This can be due to low transmission fluid, a faulty valve body, or worn clutches.
    *   Solution: Check and top off transmission fluid. If the problem persists, further diagnosis and repair may be needed, potentially involving valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic (for 1.4L Turbo Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky shifts, especially at low speeds, hesitation when accelerating from a stop. These symptoms are common complaints with dual-clutch transmissions.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) may improve shift quality. In some cases, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $2000+ (clutch replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, uneven tire wear, poor handling. Worn components may include struts, shocks, control arm bushings, and ball joints.
    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner, depending on the components needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent flickering or failure of the instrument cluster, incorrect readings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the instrument cluster may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows not operating, only operating intermittently or with a delay.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window motor, window regulator, or window switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.

    * Solution: Center console replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Dodge Dart, while offering a stylish design and comfortable ride, appears to have some common issues, especially related to its engine and transmission options. The 2.4L engine seems to be susceptible to excessive oil consumption, while the 1.4L turbo can have coolant leak and turbocharger failure problems. The transmissions, both the traditional automatic and the dual-clutch, can exhibit rough shifting and slipping. Suspension components may wear prematurely, and electrical issues with the instrument cluster and power windows have also been reported. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like spark plug replacement to more significant expenses like engine rebuilds or transmission replacements, making it important to thoroughly inspect any potential purchase.
