### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Dodge Vision demonstrates average reliability, with its diesel engine variants being the primary source of reported concerns, particularly regarding the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and EGR system. The Dualogic automatic transmission can also present issues with its actuator and control module. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module or infotainment system, are another area to monitor. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components generally hold up well. For gasoline models with the 1.4L turbo engine and manual transmission, reliability appears to be stronger. Regular maintenance, especially for diesel models, is crucial for mitigating potential problems.
