### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Dodge Vision presents a mixed reliability profile. The manual transmission variants are generally robust. However, the Dualogic automated manual transmission has been a source of concern, particularly with its clutch actuator and control module. Diesel engines, while efficient, can encounter issues with the turbocharger and EGR valve. Petrol engines with the MultiAir technology may experience problems with the MultiAir unit itself. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Interior electronics, especially the Uconnect system, can be prone to software glitches. While the chassis and exterior are typically solid, potential buyers should be aware of these specific powertrain and electrical vulnerabilities, especially when considering models with the Dualogic transmission or the MultiAir petrol engine.
