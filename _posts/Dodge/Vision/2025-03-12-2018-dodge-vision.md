While the "Dodge Vision" isn't an actual vehicle model produced by Dodge, let's assume you meant to ask about the **2018 Dodge Journey**, which is a similarly named vehicle from that era. The 2018 Dodge Journey is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its affordability and available third-row seating. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission for the 2.4L and a 6-speed automatic transmission for the 3.6L. People often appreciate the Journey's value for money and spaciousness, but common criticisms include its outdated design, lackluster fuel economy, and less-than-stellar performance compared to competitors.
