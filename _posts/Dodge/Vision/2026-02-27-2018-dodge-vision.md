### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Dodge Vision offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly with its manual transmission variants. The diesel engines, while efficient, can be prone to DPF and EGR issues, common in many diesel applications. The petrol turbo engine's MultiAir system and turbocharger are potential points of concern. Automatic transmission issues, especially with the Dualogic system, are the most frequently cited mechanical problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and infotainment, can occur but are not pervasive. Overall, for a budget-conscious compact car, the Vision's reliability is adequate, with most issues being manageable and repairable, though proactive maintenance on diesel systems is recommended.
