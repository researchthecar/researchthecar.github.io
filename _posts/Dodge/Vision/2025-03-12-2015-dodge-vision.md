The 2015 Dodge Dart, marketed as the Dodge Vision in Mexico, is a compact sedan that aims to offer a blend of sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and modern technology. Engine options include a 2.0L Tigershark I4 producing 160 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque, a 1.4L MultiAir Turbo I4 generating 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L Tigershark MultiAir 2 I4 delivering 184 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices consist of a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a 6-speed dual clutch automatic (DCT) available only with the 1.4L Turbo. Many owners appreciate the Dart's distinctive styling and available technology features. However, some criticisms include concerns about reliability, fuel economy not always meeting expectations, and a somewhat cramped rear seat.
