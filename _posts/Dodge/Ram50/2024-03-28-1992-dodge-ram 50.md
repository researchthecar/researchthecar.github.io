**Introduction**

The 1992 Dodge Ram 50 is a compact pickup truck that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that produced 110 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 3.0-liter V6 was also available, which produced 141 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a five-speed manual and a three-speed automatic.

Owners of the Ram 50 generally praise its reliability, affordability, and off-road capabilities. However, some common issues have been reported with the vehicle, including:

**Engine**

**2.4L Four-Cylinder**

* **Engine Overheating:** Head gasket failure can cause the engine to overheat. Symptoms include a high engine temperature gauge reading, loss of coolant, and white smoke from the exhaust pipe. Repair involves replacing the head gasket, which costs around $1,000-$1,500.
* **Valvetrain Noise:** Worn valve lifters can cause a ticking noise from the engine. Replacement lifters cost around $200-$300 for parts and labor.

**3.0L V6**

* **Ignition Coil Failure:** Faulty ignition coils can cause misfires and poor engine performance. Symptoms include a rough idle, hesitation during acceleration, and reduced fuel economy. Replacing all six ignition coils costs around $500-$700.
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A leaking intake manifold gasket can cause a vacuum leak, which can lead to rough idling, stalling, and reduced power. Repair involves replacing the gasket, which costs around $200-$300.

**Transmission**

**Five-Speed Manual**

* **Shifting Problems:** Worn or broken shift linkage can cause difficulty shifting gears. Symptoms include grinding gears and difficulty finding gears. Repair involves inspecting and replacing the shift linkage, which costs around $200-$400.

**Three-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slippage:** Worn transmission clutch packs can cause the transmission to slip, resulting in a loss of power and difficulty shifting gears. Repair involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission, which costs around $1,500-$2,500.

**Suspension**

* **Front Ball Joint Failure:** Worn ball joints can cause the front suspension to become unstable, leading to uneven tire wear and potential loss of control. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front of the vehicle and excessive play in the steering wheel. Replacement ball joints cost around $200-$300 per side.
* **Rear Leaf Spring Wear:** Worn leaf springs can cause the rear suspension to sag, reducing ride height and affecting suspension performance. Symptoms include a lower rear ride height and a rough ride. Repair involves replacing the leaf springs, which costs around $500-$700 per side.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** A failing alternator can reduce charging capacity, leading to a dead battery and electrical problems. Symptoms include dim headlights, difficulty starting the vehicle, and battery warning lights on the dashboard. Replacing the alternator costs around $500-$700.
* **Starter Failure:** A worn starter can cause difficulty starting the engine. Symptoms include a slow or hesitant start, or a clicking noise when trying to start the engine. Replacing the starter costs around $300-$500.
