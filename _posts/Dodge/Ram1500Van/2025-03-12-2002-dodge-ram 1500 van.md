The 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 Van is a full-size cargo and passenger van known for its utilitarian design, spacious interior, and robust build. Engine options included a 3.9L V6, a 5.2L V8, and a 5.9L V8. The 5.2L V8 produced approximately 230 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, and was the most common V8 option selected. Transmission options were primarily a 4-speed automatic (42RE/46RE) and, less frequently, a 5-speed manual. Owners typically appreciate the van's cargo capacity, reliability (when well-maintained), and straightforward mechanical design. Common dislikes include fuel economy, ride quality, and dated interior features.

Engine issues, such as cracked exhaust manifolds and intake manifold gasket failures, can be moderately expensive to repair. Transmission problems, like slipping or harsh shifting, could potentially lead to costly rebuilds or replacements. Suspension issues typically involve replacing worn components, which are relatively affordable but contribute to overall maintenance. Electrical problems can range from minor fixes to more involved repairs. Exterior and interior issues, such as rust and sagging headliners, can affect the van's appearance and value. Generally, owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with an older vehicle. The severity of the problems varies, but proactive maintenance and addressing issues promptly can help mitigate expenses.
