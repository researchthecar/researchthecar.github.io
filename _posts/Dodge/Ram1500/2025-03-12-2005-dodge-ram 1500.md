The 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its ruggedness and bold styling. Engine options included the 3.7L Magnum V6 (215 hp, 235 lb-ft of torque), the 4.7L Magnum V8 (235 hp, 300 lb-ft of torque), and the 5.7L Hemi V8 (345 hp, 375 lb-ft of torque). Transmission choices were primarily a 5-speed manual (NV3500/NV4500, depending on engine and configuration) and a 5-speed automatic (545RFE). Owners often appreciate the Ram's powerful engines, spacious cab, and towing capacity. Common dislikes include fuel economy, certain reliability issues (especially with specific years/engines), and interior material quality.

**Summary**

The 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 can be a reliable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine problems like exhaust manifold bolts and the "Hemi Tick" in the 4.7 and 5.7, transmission issues with the 545RFE automatic, and electrical gremlins related to the TIPM are the most concerning. Suspension wear (ball joints, tie rod ends) is typical for a truck of this age. Rust can be a significant issue, especially in colder climates. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like valve seat repairs or TIPM replacement, can be costly. A thorough inspection before purchasing is highly recommended.
