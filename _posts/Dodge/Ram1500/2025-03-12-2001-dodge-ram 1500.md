**Summary**

The 2001 Dodge Ram 1500, while a capable truck, faces some common issues, primarily due to its age. Engine issues like plenum gasket leaks and PCM failures (5.2L) can lead to performance problems. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, can be costly to repair. Suspension components wear out, and rust is a significant concern, especially in certain regions. Interior issues such as dashboard cracks and headliner sagging are also common. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or extensive rust repair, can be quite costly.
