**Engine**

**3.7L Magnum V6**

*   **Cracked Exhaust Manifolds**

**4.7L Magnum V8**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 4.7L engines, especially those with infrequent oil changes, are prone to developing sludge buildup, leading to reduced oil pressure and potential engine damage. Symptoms include engine knocking, rough idling, and oil pressure warning lights.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and engine flush treatments may help prevent or mitigate sludge buildup. In severe cases, engine disassembly and cleaning or engine replacement may be necessary.
