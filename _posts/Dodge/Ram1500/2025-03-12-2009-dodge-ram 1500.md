The 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 represents the first year of the fourth generation of this popular pickup truck. This year brought a significant redesign, focusing on ride quality, interior comfort, and updated styling. While praised for its comfortable ride (thanks in part to a coil-spring rear suspension) and more refined interior compared to previous generations, the 2009 Ram 1500 does have some common issues. Engine options include the 3.7L V6 (215 hp, 235 lb-ft of torque), the 4.7L V8 (310 hp, 330 lb-ft of torque), and the 5.7L Hemi V8 (390 hp, 407 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options are primarily the 4-speed automatic (with the 3.7L and some 4.7L models) and the 5-speed automatic. The 2009 Ram 1500 is generally liked for its car-like ride and comfort, as well as the power of the Hemi engine. Common dislikes include fuel economy and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**4.7L V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, especially noticeable on a cold start. This noise is due to an exhaust leak. Broken exhaust manifold bolts are a common cause.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold gasket. In some cases, the exhaust manifold itself may need replacement if warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether the manifold needs replacing).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or tapping noise, especially at idle. This is often attributed to issues with the lifters or valve train. Can worsen over time.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial. It could be a faulty lifter, rocker arm, or exhaust manifold leak. Repair ranges from replacing individual lifters/rocker arms to a complete valve job or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (for exhaust manifold leak) - $3000+ (for internal engine repairs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, especially noticeable on a cold start. This noise is due to an exhaust leak. Broken exhaust manifold bolts are a common cause.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold gasket. In some cases, the exhaust manifold itself may need replacement if warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether the manifold needs replacing).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft and Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A very noticeable ticking or knocking sound from the engine, misfires, rough idle, loss of power, and potentially stalling. This is a more serious issue than the typical "Hemi tick."
    *   Solution: Requires replacing the camshaft and potentially all lifters. In some cases, the roller lifters can fail and damage the camshaft lobes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+ (depending on the extent of damage).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **No Issues Found**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at highway speeds.  Can also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.  It's often recommended to flush the transmission and replace the filter at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or jerky shifts between gears, slipping out of gear, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Can be caused by low transmission fluid, a faulty solenoid pack, or more serious internal damage. Diagnosis is crucial. May require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for fluid change) - $3500+ (for rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Coil Spring Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, uneven ride height, and potential for increased wear on other suspension components.  Can be caused by broken or weakened coil springs.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear coil springs. It is recommended to replace them in pairs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front end, especially over bumps.  Loose or wandering steering.  Uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacing worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends.  A wheel alignment is recommended after replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side (depending on the part and labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A wide range of electrical problems, including fuel pump relay failure (leading to stalling or no start), intermittent starting, power window/door lock malfunctions, and lighting issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the TIPM. However, diagnosis is crucial to confirm the TIPM is the root cause. Some mechanics can attempt to repair the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on repair vs. replacement and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Uconnect Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Radio not working, freezing, or randomly shutting off. Uconnect system failing to connect to Bluetooth or freezing.
    *   Solution: Software updates, radio replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software Update) - $800 (Radio Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The tailgate handle breaks or becomes difficult to use, making it hard to open the tailgate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the tailgate handle assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard, especially in sun-exposed areas. This is a common problem with the 2009 Ram 1500 and can detract from the interior's appearance.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Dashboard Cover) - $1500+ (Dashboard Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noises behind the dashboard when adjusting the temperature or vent settings.  Inconsistent temperature output from the vents (e.g., cold air on one side, hot air on the other).
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on location and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Dodge Ram 1500, while offering a more comfortable ride and refined interior compared to its predecessors, does present owners with a range of potential issues. Engine problems, especially with the Hemi V8, can be costly due to potential lifter or camshaft failures. Electrical issues stemming from the TIPM are also a common concern. Suspension and interior problems, while generally less severe, can still contribute to overall ownership costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances like a broken tailgate handle to major mechanical problems like engine or transmission failure. The estimated cost to fix these problems ranges from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major overhauls or replacements. Buyers should carefully inspect any potential 2009 Ram 1500 for these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
