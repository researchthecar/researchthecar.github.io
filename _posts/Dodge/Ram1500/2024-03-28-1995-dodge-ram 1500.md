The most common issues include intake manifold gasket failure, valve cover gasket leaks, and piston ring failure in the 5.2L V8 engine; cylinder head gasket failure, fuel injector failure, and exhaust manifold cracking in the 5.9L V8 engine; torque converter failure and transmission slipping in the 4-speed automatic transmission; clutch failure and shift fork wear in the 5-speed manual transmission; ball joint failure and leaf spring failure in the front suspension; shock absorber failure in the rear suspension; alternator failure and starter failure in the electrical system; tail light failure and headlight failure in the exterior; and power window failure and radio failure in the interior. While many of these issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, some, such as engine and transmission problems, can be more severe and costly to repair.
