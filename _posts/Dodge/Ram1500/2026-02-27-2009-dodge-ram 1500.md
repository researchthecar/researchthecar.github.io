### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 offers a generally dependable ownership experience, particularly with the HEMI V8 engine, though it's not without its potential issues. Owners should be aware of common problems such as cylinder head issues on the 4.7L, MDS complications on the 5.7L, and potential transmission shifting problems. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and premature alternator failure are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. While suspension components like ball joints and sway bar links may require attention over time, and interior items like the HVAC blower motor can fail, these are often manageable repairs. Proactive maintenance and addressing early symptoms can significantly mitigate these reliability concerns.
