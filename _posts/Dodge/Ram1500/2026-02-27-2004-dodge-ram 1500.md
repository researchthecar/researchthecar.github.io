### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Dodge Ram 1500, across its various engine and transmission options, presents a mixed reliability profile. The 4.7L V8 is prone to head gasket issues and spark plug blow-out, while the 5.7L HEMI can experience MDS problems. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 45RFE/545RFE, may require attention for torque converter or solenoid pack issues. Manual transmissions are generally more robust but clutch wear is a common factor. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are typical wear items for a truck of this age and usage. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster and window motor failures, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. Overall, while capable, potential buyers should be aware of these specific issues and factor in potential repair costs.
