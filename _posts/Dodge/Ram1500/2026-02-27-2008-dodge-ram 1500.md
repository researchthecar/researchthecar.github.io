### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Dodge Ram 1500 offers a generally dependable ownership experience, particularly with its HEMI V8 engine. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as the Multi-Displacement System (MDS) on the 5.7L HEMI, which can lead to lifter and internal engine problems if not addressed. Transmission issues, particularly with the 5-speed automatic, can arise, with torque converter shudder being a notable concern. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and exterior rust are also points to inspect. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Ram 1500s continue to serve reliably with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
