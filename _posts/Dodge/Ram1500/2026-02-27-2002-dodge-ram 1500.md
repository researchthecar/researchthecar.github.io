### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 presents a mixed reliability profile. The 5.9L Magnum V8 is generally considered the most robust engine option with fewer widespread issues. The 4.7L V8, while powerful, is more prone to significant problems like head gasket failures and spark plug blow-out. The V6 has its own set of common leaks. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 42RE, can experience torque converter issues, while the 45RFE/545RFE may have solenoid pack problems. Manual transmissions are typically more reliable. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster and window motor failures, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on climate. Interior issues like sagging headliners and HVAC resistor failures are also reported. Overall, while capable, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and factor in potential repair costs.
