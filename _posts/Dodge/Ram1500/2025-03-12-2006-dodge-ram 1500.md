The 2006 Dodge Ram 1500 has a range of potential issues, with the severity varying depending on the engine and transmission configuration. The 5.7L HEMI's valve seat issue is potentially the most severe, requiring expensive engine work. The 4.7L's sludge buildup is also concerning. Electrical issues like instrument cluster failures and power window motor problems can be annoying and costly. Rust is a common problem on older trucks, so that is worth noting. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be substantial, so it's important to have a thorough inspection before purchasing this truck.
