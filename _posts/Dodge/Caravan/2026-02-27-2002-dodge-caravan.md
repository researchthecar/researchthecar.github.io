### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Dodge Caravan is a functional minivan with common issues for its age and class. Engine reliability varies by specific motor, with the V6 engines being more prone to head gasket issues than the 4-cylinder. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic units, often involve slipping or harsh shifting, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and instrument cluster, are not uncommon. Suspension components like ball joints and springs are typical wear items that may require attention. While exterior rust can be a concern, especially in certain climates, and interior wear is expected, these are generally manageable. Overall, the 2002 Caravan can be a reliable vehicle if well-maintained and potential issues are addressed promptly.
