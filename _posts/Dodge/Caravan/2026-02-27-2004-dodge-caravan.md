### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Dodge Caravan is a functional minivan with several common issues to monitor. Engine reliability can be a concern, particularly with head gasket failures on the 2.4L and intake manifold leaks on V6 models. Transmission problems, such as slipping and overheating, are also frequently reported. Suspension components like ball joints and springs can wear out, and electrical issues, especially with the BCM and power windows, are not uncommon. Exterior rust and interior wear, particularly the dashboard, are also points to consider. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the Caravan to be a practical and affordable vehicle when properly maintained.
