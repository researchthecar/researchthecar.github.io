The 2004 Dodge Caravan is a popular minivan known for its practicality and affordability. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder (150 hp, 165 lb-ft torque), a 3.3L V6 (180 hp, 210 lb-ft torque), and a 3.8L V6 (215 hp, 245 lb-ft torque). Transmission options were primarily a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Caravan's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and ample storage. However, common complaints include electrical issues, transmission problems (especially in higher mileage vehicles), and some engine-related concerns. Rust can also be a significant problem, particularly in areas with road salt.
