The 2003 Dodge Sprinter 3500 is a workhorse van known for its impressive cargo capacity and fuel efficiency compared to other vans of its time. This model year was available with either a 2.7L inline-5 cylinder turbocharged diesel engine producing 154 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.3L Inline-4 gasoline engine that produces 141 hp and 154 ft-lbs of torque. Both engine options were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter's tall roof, which allows for comfortable standing inside, and its relatively narrow width, which makes it easier to maneuver in urban environments. However, some common complaints include the van's age-related maintenance needs, potential for rust, and the relatively high cost of replacement parts, especially for diesel engine components.

**Summary**

The 2003 Dodge Sprinter 3500 is a capable van, but its age means that certain issues are more prevalent. Engine and transmission problems, particularly with the diesel engine and the automatic transmission, can be costly to repair. Rust is a common concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Suspension and electrical issues also contribute to the overall maintenance burden. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like turbocharger or valve body replacement, can quickly add up. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for rust, engine noises, and transmission performance before making a purchase.
