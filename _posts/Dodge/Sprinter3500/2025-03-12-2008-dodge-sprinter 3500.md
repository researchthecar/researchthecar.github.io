The 2008 Dodge Sprinter 3500 is a versatile cargo van popular for its spacious interior and diesel engine options. The 2008 model year offered two engine choices: a 3.0L V6 diesel engine producing 154 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a less common 3.5L V6 gasoline engine, which we will omit due to it's scarcity. The only transmission option was a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Sprinter's high roof and cargo capacity, making it ideal for commercial use and camper van conversions. However, some common complaints include higher maintenance costs associated with the diesel engine, electrical gremlins, and rust issues.

**Summary**

The 2008 Dodge Sprinter 3500, while appreciated for its utility, faces common issues typical of vans in its class and age, especially those equipped with diesel engines. Engine-related problems, particularly with the EGR valve, DPF, turbocharger, and oil cooler can be costly. Transmission issues can also occur. Electrical problems and rust are concerns as well. Suspension issues and door issues can become problematic for a vehicle with this high of miles, given it is now over 15 years old. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the extent of the damage, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. The diesel engine, while offering good fuel economy, tends to be more expensive to maintain than gasoline engines.
