The 2009 Dodge Sprinter 3500 is a popular cargo and passenger van known for its versatility and fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel engine). The primary engine option for the 2009 Sprinter 3500 was the 3.0L V6 Turbo Diesel engine. This engine produced around 154 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. The 2009 Sprinter 3500 did not have many engine options. Owners generally appreciate the Sprinter's cargo capacity, fuel economy (for a large van), and maneuverability. Common complaints often revolve around repair costs, specific component failures (especially related to emissions systems on the diesel), and some electrical gremlins.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6 Turbo Diesel (OM642)**

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light. Codes related to EGR flow or performance are common.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve. Cleaning may provide a temporary fix, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF, designed to trap particulate matter from the exhaust, can become clogged, especially with frequent short trips. Symptoms include reduced power, increased fuel consumption, and warning lights on the dashboard. Regeneration cycles may fail.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration (performed by a mechanic), DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (for cleaning) to $2000+ (for replacement)

*   **Oil Cooler Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks appearing near the oil filter housing or underneath the engine. Can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil cooler seals or the entire oil cooler assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (NAG1/WA580)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shaking or shuddering during light acceleration or cruising, especially at lower speeds. Often felt in the seat.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush using the correct fluid spec (Shell ATF 134 or equivalent), or torque converter replacement if the flush doesn't resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (fluid flush) to $1000 - $2000+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifting, delayed engagement, slipping between gears, or complete loss of gear engagement. Can also cause the transmission to get stuck in one gear (limp mode).
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate (also called the valve body plate) can develop electrical faults or cracks. This can lead to erratic shifting, getting stuck in gear, or transmission codes related to solenoids or speed sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transmission conductor plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging or Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the van sitting lower than normal, especially when loaded. Can also cause a rough ride and reduced load-carrying capacity. Visible cracks in the leaf springs.

**Summary:**

The 2009 Dodge Sprinter 3500 is generally a reliable van, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the diesel engine and transmission. The most common problems involve the EGR valve, DPF, turbocharger, and oil cooler on the engine side, and torque converter shudder and valve body problems on the transmission side. Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are also areas to watch. Repair costs can be significant, especially for diesel-related components. Inspecting for rust and properly maintaining the vehicle can help prevent more serious problems down the road.
