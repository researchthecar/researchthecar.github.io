The 2005 Dodge Sprinter 3500 is a popular cargo van known for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency (for its size), and versatility. The North American version of this vehicle has some differences from other markets as it was built in Germany and shipped to the US as a "knock-down kit." The 2005 Dodge Sprinter 3500 was available with a 2.7L Inline-5 Turbo Diesel engine, producing 154 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate its utilitarian design and high roof options, allowing for customization and ample cargo space. Common complaints often revolve around the cost of maintenance and repairs, particularly due to the van's European design and specialized parts. While the Sprinter offers decent fuel economy for a vehicle of its size, some find the ride quality to be less refined than more modern vans.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline-5 Turbo Diesel**

*   **Black Death (Leaking Injector Seals)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injector seals fail, causing combustion gasses to leak past the injectors. This leads to a buildup of carbon around the injector base, often referred to as "black death." Symptoms include a strong diesel smell, hissing or chuffing sound from the engine bay, and eventual injector failure.
    *   Solution: Remove the injectors, clean the injector bores, and replace the copper injector seals with updated versions. In some cases, the injectors themselves may need replacement if they are damaged or seized.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ depending on the number of injectors affected and the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbo Resonator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbo resonator, a plastic component designed to reduce turbo noise, is prone to cracking and failing. This results in a loss of boost pressure, leading to reduced power and fuel economy. A whistling or hissing sound may also be present during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbo resonator with a new unit or, preferably, an aftermarket aluminum resonator delete kit. The aluminum delete is recommended as it completely removes the part that causes the issue and is more robust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for a replacement resonator. $200 - $400+ for an aluminum delete kit.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. Cleaning is sometimes possible if the valve isn't too damaged, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**NAG1 5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body, which controls the flow of transmission fluid, can experience wear and sticking valves. This can lead to harsh shifting, slipping, delayed engagement, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. Replacing the conductor plate (TCM) on the valve body may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, causing shuddering, stalling, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Often, this is done in conjunction with a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+ (depending on whether it's part of a larger transmission repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs are prone to sagging over time, especially with heavy loads. This leads to a lower ride height, reduced load capacity, and poor handling. Cracking or broken leaves are also possible.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the van is frequently used for carrying heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per side, depending on the type of springs used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ball joints wear out over time, leading to loose steering, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side, depending on labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wiring harness, particularly in areas exposed to the elements, can suffer from corrosion and chafing. This can lead to a variety of electrical problems, including intermittent lights, sensor malfunctions, and starting issues.
    *   Solution: Inspect the wiring harness for damage and repair any broken or corroded wires. In severe cases, sections of the harness may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the issue and the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Glow plugs are used to heat the combustion chamber to aid in starting. Over time, the glow plugs can fail. Symptoms include hard starting, especially in cold weather, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed glow plugs. It is recommended to replace all glow plugs at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Roller Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rollers on the sliding door can wear out or break, making the door difficult to open and close.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or broken rollers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per roller, depending on labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2005 Sprinter can be prone to rust, particularly in areas with harsh winter weather and road salt. Common areas for rust include the rocker panels, wheel wells, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Repair the rusted areas and apply rustproofing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor can fail, resulting in a lack of airflow from the vents. This can be caused by a faulty motor, a resistor failure, or a blockage in the system.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor, resistor, or clear any blockages in the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door lock actuators can fail, causing the door locks to not function properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Dodge Sprinter 3500, while a capable and versatile van, can be prone to several issues. The most common problems revolve around the diesel engine, particularly leaking injector seals and turbo resonator failures. Transmission issues, suspension wear, and electrical problems are also frequently reported. The cost of repairs can be relatively high due to the van's European design and specialized parts. Rust is also a concern, especially in colder climates. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the van for these issues and factor in the potential cost of repairs before making a purchase.
