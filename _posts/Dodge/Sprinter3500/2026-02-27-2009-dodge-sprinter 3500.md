### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Dodge Sprinter 3500 is a capable commercial vehicle with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly its diesel powertrains. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and turbochargers on the OM642 engine, and glow plug reliability on the older OM647. Transmission issues, while not rampant, can involve the torque converter or TCM. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints may require attention due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical gremlins and exterior door mechanisms are also noted areas. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning emissions systems and regular fluid checks, is crucial for maximizing the lifespan and reliability of this workhorse van.
