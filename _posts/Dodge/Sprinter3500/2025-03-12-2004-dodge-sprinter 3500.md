Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2004 Dodge Sprinter 3500, structured as requested.

The 2004 Dodge Sprinter 3500 is a full-size van known for its impressive cargo capacity and fuel efficiency compared to other vans of its era. It was popular with businesses and those looking for a base for camper conversions. Engine options included a 2.7L inline 5-cylinder diesel engine producing 154 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 gasoline engine producing 230 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter's high roof and spacious interior, but common complaints revolve around maintenance costs, electrical issues, and rust.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline 5-Cylinder Diesel**

*   **Black Death (Injector Seal Leaks)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injector seals fail, allowing combustion gases to escape, forming a black, tar-like deposit around the injectors. This can lead to injector malfunction and engine bay fire hazards. The most noticeable symptom is a chuffing or hissing sound coming from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the injector seals and cleaning the affected area. Sometimes, the injectors themselves need to be replaced if they have been damaged by the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the number of injectors affected and any consequential damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger, which boosts engine power, can fail due to oil starvation, wear, or foreign object damage. Symptoms include a loss of power, excessive smoke, and unusual noises from the turbo area.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger. It's crucial to diagnose the root cause of the failure to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+ including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor relays vital engine speed information to the ECU. Failure leads to stalling, difficulty starting, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the crankshaft position sensor, failure leads to stalling, difficulty starting, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Both Engine Options (5-Speed Automatic)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail due to wear or internal damage. Symptoms include slipping, shuddering, and difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter, and potentially rebuilding the transmission if there's consequential damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body, which controls fluid pressure within the transmission, can experience wear or clogging, leading to harsh shifting, slipping, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding or replacing the valve body. A transmission flush and filter change may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the Sprinter's load-carrying capacity, the rear leaf springs are prone to sagging or even breaking over time. This results in a lower ride height, poor handling, and potential safety issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if the vehicle is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ per spring, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ball joints in the front suspension are subject to wear, leading to clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wiring harnesses in the Sprinter can experience chafing, corrosion, and connector failures, leading to various electrical problems, including malfunctioning lights, sensors, and other components.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the damaged wiring harness sections or connectors. This often requires meticulous diagnosis to pinpoint the exact location of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the complexity and location of the damage.
