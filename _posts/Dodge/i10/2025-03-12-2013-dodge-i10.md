The 2013 Dodge i10, more accurately known as the Hyundai i10, was not sold in North America. It was primarily sold in Europe and Asia. It was offered with a few different engine options, the most common of which include a 1.0L inline 3-cylinder petrol engine producing around 68 horsepower and 70 lb-ft of torque and a 1.2L inline 4-cylinder petrol engine producing around 85 horsepower and 88 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the car for its fuel efficiency, compact size making it ideal for city driving, and affordability. However, common dislikes include limited rear passenger space, relatively basic interior features, and modest performance, especially with the smaller engine.

**Summary**

The 2013 Hyundai i10 (marketed as the Dodge i10 in some regions) generally suffers from issues typical of small, budget-oriented cars. Engine issues, such as rough idling or timing chain wear in the 1.0L engine and valve noise/oil leaks in the 1.2L engine, can be moderate in severity and cost. Transmission problems, while not extremely common, can be expensive if major repairs or replacements are needed. Suspension wear and electrical problems are also present, but the biggest issues are related to the engine and transmission. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for maintaining the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
