### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Dodge Journey presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline engines (2.4L and 3.6L V6) are generally considered robust with no widespread major issues. However, the 2.0L turbo diesel variant is more prone to specific diesel-related problems like DPF and EGR issues, requiring more specialized maintenance and potentially higher repair costs. The 6-speed automatic transmission can experience shifting problems and hesitation, often necessitating costly repairs. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the TIPM and battery drain, are also notable concerns. While the exterior and interior are generally free from significant technical defects, potential buyers should be aware of the powertrain and electrical system's common issues.
