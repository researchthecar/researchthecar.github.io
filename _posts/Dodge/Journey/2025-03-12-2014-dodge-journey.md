Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2014 Dodge Journey, categorized by major components. The 2014 Dodge Journey is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its affordability and available third-row seating. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.6L Pentastar V6 generating 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission (with the 2.4L) or a 6-speed automatic transmission (with the 3.6L). Drivers often appreciate the Journey's spaciousness and versatility, but criticize its fuel economy, dated interior, and relatively unrefined driving experience.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls unexpectedly, especially at low speeds or when idling.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a mechanic to identify the root cause, which could range from a faulty sensor (crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor), vacuum leak, or issues with the throttle body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause and required parts/labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes oil at a higher than normal rate, requiring frequent oil additions between changes. Can lead to engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks. Diagnosis to rule out leaks. Potential repairs include valve stem seals or piston ring replacement (more extensive and costly).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the plastic oil filter adapter housing, often dripping onto the exhaust manifold and causing a burning smell. The plastic housing is prone to cracking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter adapter housing, preferably with an updated aluminum version to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rocker Arm/Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or tapping noise from the engine, rough running, misfires. Can be caused by worn or damaged rocker arms or lifters.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected rocker arms and lifters. This can be a labor-intensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the damage and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, especially between gears. Transmission may slip or fail to engage properly.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush/change (if condition is not severe). More extensive repairs may involve valve body repair/replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 3.6L)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or rough shifts between gears, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. Hesitation when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, further diagnosis may reveal problems with the valve body, solenoids, or internal transmission components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Worn control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, or strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings or complete control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ per corner, depending on which components need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Spring Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower in the rear than the front, especially when loaded with passengers or cargo. Weak or sagging rear coil springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Multiple electrical problems, including the vehicle not starting, fuel pump not operating correctly, lights malfunctioning, wipers not working, and other seemingly unrelated electrical issues. The TIPM is a known weak point in many Chrysler vehicles of this era.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM. Some shops specialize in repairing TIPMs, which can be a more cost-effective option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (replacement or repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window/Lock Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows or door locks. Can be caused by faulty switches, wiring issues, or failing door lock actuators.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the source of the problem. Replacement of the faulty switch, wiring repair, or door lock actuator replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per window/door.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (update) - $500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Dodge Journey has a range of potential issues that buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly oil leaks and excessive consumption in both engine options, can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, though not universal, are a concern, especially with the earlier 4-speed automatic. Electrical problems, particularly with the TIPM, can be frustrating and expensive to diagnose and fix. The suspension and interior components also have their weaknesses. Overall, while the Journey offers affordability and practicality, potential owners should factor in the possibility of these repairs when considering a purchase. The severity and cost of these issues can vary significantly, so a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
