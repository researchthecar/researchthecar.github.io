The 2019 Dodge Journey is a mid-size crossover SUV that offers seating for up to seven passengers. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6L engine came with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Journey's affordability and spacious interior. Common complaints include the outdated design, lackluster fuel economy, and reliability concerns.
