Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2012 Dodge Journey, organized as requested.

The 2012 Dodge Journey is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its affordability and available third-row seating, making it a popular choice for families. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 generating 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6L is mated to a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Journey's spaciousness and value, but common complaints include its lackluster fuel economy, especially with the 2.4L engine, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the 2.4L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke, and engine knocking.
    *   Solution: The issue is often related to piston ring failure and/or worn valve stem seals. In severe cases, engine replacement or a major overhaul including piston ring replacement and valve stem seal replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the engine randomly stalling, typically at low speeds or while idling. This can create a dangerous situation in traffic.
    *   Solution: The cause can vary, ranging from a faulty throttle body to issues with the crank position sensor or camshaft position sensor. Diagnosis requires professional inspection, and the solution depends on the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil filter adapter/housing, often made of plastic, is prone to cracking and leaking oil. Symptoms include visible oil leaks near the oil filter and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter adapter/housing with an updated design (sometimes metal) is the common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L engine)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or delayed shifts, especially between gears. Hesitation when accelerating is also a common complaint.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can help. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 3.6L engine)**

*   **Shifting Problems/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 6-speed automatic transmission, including slipping, rough shifting, and complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair depend on the specific problem. Issues can range from a faulty solenoid pack to a worn torque converter or internal damage requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (solenoid) - $4,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report premature wear of suspension components, including struts, shocks, and control arm bushings. This can lead to a bumpy ride, poor handling, and excessive noise.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn components. It's often recommended to replace struts/shocks in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per component (depending on location and whether you DIY or go to a shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM is a common source of electrical problems. Symptoms include the vehicle not starting, fuel pump relay failure, intermittent stalling, power window malfunctions, and erratic behavior of various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM is the usual solution. In some cases, the fuel pump relay can be bypassed with an external relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ (TIPM replacement)
    *   Recalls:
        *   13V-252: THE FUEL PUMP RELAY INSIDE THE TOTALLY INTEGRATED POWER MODULE (TIPM) MAY FAIL, CAUSING THE ENGINE TO STALL WITHOUT WARNING
        *   14V-530: THE SOFTWARE ON THE TIPM CAN BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SOFTWARE INSTALLED ON THE REST OF THE VEHICLE.
        *   15V-467: THE POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE (PCM) IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY, PREVENTING THE WARNING CHIMES FROM SOUNDING WHEN THE KEY IS IN THE IGNITION AND THE DRIVER'S DOOR IS OPEN.

*   **Power Window Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some users report that the power windows will stop working, sometimes intermittently, due to faulty window motors or regulators.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty window motor or regulator is the best solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500 per window.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear wiper motor is prone to failure, leaving the rear window obscured in wet conditions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear wiper motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks, particularly in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is the most complete solution, though expensive. Dashboard covers are a less expensive alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Heater and AC Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the heating and air conditioning systems, including inconsistent temperatures, weak airflow, or complete failure.
    * Solution: The cause can vary, ranging from a faulty blower motor resistor to issues with the blend door actuator or refrigerant leaks. Diagnosis requires professional inspection, and the solution depends on the root cause.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Dodge Journey has several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, especially oil consumption in the 2.4L and oil filter housing leaks in the 3.6L, can be costly to repair. Electrical problems with the TIPM are also a frequent concern. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive to fix, making it important to carefully inspect a used Journey before purchase and factor potential repair costs into the overall value.
