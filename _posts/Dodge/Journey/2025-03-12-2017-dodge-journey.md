Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2017 Dodge Journey, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options where applicable. The 2017 Dodge Journey is a mid-size SUV known for its affordability and available third-row seating, making it a practical choice for families. However, it's also criticized for its dated design, lower fuel economy compared to competitors, and some reliability concerns. The 2017 model year offered two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6L engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the 2.4L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, engine knocking, and potentially engine damage if not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and potentially replacing valve stem seals or piston rings if the consumption is severe. A compression test can help diagnose the source of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the source and severity of the problem.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls randomly, especially at low speeds or when idling.
    *   Solution: Check the fuel system, ignition system, and sensors. The issue could be with the idle air control valve, throttle position sensor, or crank position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the failed part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks from the oil filter housing are a common issue with the Pentastar V6. The plastic housing can crack or warp over time, leading to oil leaks.
