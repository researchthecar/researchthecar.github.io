### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Dodge Journey presents a mixed reliability profile. Owners have reported common issues primarily related to the powertrain, particularly with the automatic transmissions, which can exhibit harsh shifting or hesitation. Engine oil and coolant leaks are also noted for both the 2.4L and 3.6L engines. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts can wear prematurely. Electrically, the Body Control Module and infotainment system have been sources of concern, leading to various malfunctions. Exterior and interior components, such as door handles and HVAC blower motors, have also seen reported failures. While not universally problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these recurring issues and factor in potential repair costs.
