Some owners appreciate the Journey's affordable price point and spacious interior, while others criticize its outdated design, lackluster fuel economy, and reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L I4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating, engine noise, and potentially engine damage if left unaddressed.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the oil consumption (e.g., worn piston rings, valve stem seals) is crucial. Repair or replacement of the affected components is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ depending on the source of the oil consumption and required repairs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

* **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: The plastic oil filter housing is prone to cracking and leaking, causing oil loss.
    * Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing with an updated aluminum version is the most common and permanent fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.4L I4)**

No Issues Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 3.6L Pentastar V6)**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation when accelerating can also occur.
    * Solution: Often, a software update/reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) can improve shifting performance. In some cases, valve body issues or internal damage may require repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reflash) to $1,500 - $3,500+ (transmission repair/replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report needing to replace struts/shocks at relatively low mileages. Symptoms include excessive bouncing, poor handling, and noise over bumps.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn struts/shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per axle (pair of struts/shocks).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The TIPM is a common source of electrical problems. Issues can manifest as fuel pump relay failure (leading to stalling or no-start conditions), power window malfunctions, horn failure, or other seemingly random electrical glitches.
    * Solution: Replacement of the TIPM. In some cases, a fuel pump relay bypass can be performed, but this is generally considered a temporary fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ (TIPM replacement).
    * Recalls: Recall Number 14V530000 was issued for the fuel pump relay issue.

**Exterior**

* **Rear Wiper Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear wiper motor can fail, rendering the rear wiper inoperable.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear wiper motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Uconnect System Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with the Uconnect infotainment system, including freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation malfunctions.
    * Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve Uconnect issues. In more severe cases, the Uconnect module may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $500 - $1,000+ (module replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Dodge Journey has several commonly reported issues. The most significant and potentially costly issues revolve around the TIPM, oil filter housing leaks (3.6L), and potential transmission problems. While some problems are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly. The severity of these issues ranges from inconveniences (Uconnect problems) to potentially dangerous situations (fuel pump relay failure). Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect any 2013 Journey before purchase. It's crucial to check the vehicle's maintenance history and look for signs of any of these common issues.
