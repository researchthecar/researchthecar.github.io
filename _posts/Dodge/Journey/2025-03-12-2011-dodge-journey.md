The 2011 Dodge Journey is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its available third-row seating and affordable price point. Engine options for this year include a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine that produces 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6L is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Journey's spacious interior and versatility. However, common complaints include less-than-stellar fuel economy (especially with the V6), some reliability concerns, and a somewhat dated interior design.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly, especially at idle or low speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: The issue may be related to a faulty throttle body, a malfunctioning crankshaft position sensor, or vacuum leaks. Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is recommended. Cleaning or replacing the throttle body, replacing the crankshaft position sensor, and sealing vacuum leaks are potential solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks originating from the oil filter housing. This can result in oil consumption and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing, which is often made of plastic and prone to cracking. An updated aluminum version is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L engine)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting between gears. This can be more pronounced when cold.
    *   Solution: Fluid change may help. However, if the issue persists, valve body wear or internal damage may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) to $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 3.6L engine)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, especially at low speeds or during light acceleration. Often described as feeling like driving over rumble strips.
    *   Solution: A fluid flush using a specific type of fluid, such as an updated formulation from the manufacturer may resolve the issue. In some cases, torque converter replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid flush) to $500 - $1200+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll during turns, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn or broken sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per link (depending on location and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A wide range of electrical problems, including issues with the fuel pump relay (resulting in stalling or no-start conditions), power windows, door locks, headlights, and wipers.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on repair vs. replacement and parts/labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) Module**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminating on the dashboard, loss of ABS functionality, and potential brake issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm the issue and then replacement of the ABS module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch (liftgate) failing to stay open on its own and slamming shut.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (for a pair of struts, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in sun-exposed areas.

**Summary**

The 2011 Dodge Journey has a variety of potential issues, ranging from relatively minor annoyances to more significant problems. Engine and transmission issues, particularly those related to the 3.6L engine's oil filter housing and the 6-speed automatic transmission's torque converter, can be costly to repair. Electrical problems related to the TIPM are also a common concern. Suspension issues are typical for a vehicle of this age. While the Journey offers affordability and versatility, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
