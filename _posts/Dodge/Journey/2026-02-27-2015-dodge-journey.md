### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Dodge Journey presents a mixed reliability profile. While its engines (2.4L and 3.6L V6) are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential oil and cooling system leaks, which are common across many vehicles of this age. The 6-speed automatic transmission can experience shifting issues and overheating, often requiring fluid services or more extensive repairs. Suspension components like struts and ball joints may need replacement due to wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module and alternator, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior issues like blend door actuators and infotainment glitches are not uncommon. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, the Journey requires attention to fluid maintenance and proactive addressing of reported component weaknesses to maintain optimal reliability.
