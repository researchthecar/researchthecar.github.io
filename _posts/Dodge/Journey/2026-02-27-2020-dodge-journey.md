### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Dodge Journey, while offering a budget-friendly option, exhibits a reliability profile that reflects its age. Common issues tend to center around the powertrain (engine oil leaks, transmission shifting problems) and electrical systems (BCM glitches, infotainment issues). Suspension components like struts and ball joints can also require attention. Exterior rust and interior wear are also noted concerns. While not universally problematic, owners should be prepared for potential repairs beyond standard maintenance, particularly as the vehicle ages. It is advisable to thoroughly inspect any pre-owned 2020 Journey for these specific issues before purchase.
