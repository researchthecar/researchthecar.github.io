The 2015 Dodge Journey is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its affordability and available third-row seating. It's generally appreciated for its spaciousness and value, but criticized for its dated design, below-average fuel economy, and unrefined driving experience. Engine options for the 2015 Journey include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 generating 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6L V6 is mated to a 6-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, leading to the need for frequent oil top-offs. Can result in low oil level warnings, engine knocking, and potentially engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels frequently and top off as needed. In severe cases, engine repairs or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Adapter Housing Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the oil filter adapter housing. This can cause a burning oil smell, low oil pressure, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter adapter housing, often including new gaskets and seals. Updated aluminum housings are available that are more durable than the original plastic version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L engine)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifts, slipping between gears, failure to shift at all. Often accompanied by warning lights on the dash.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include low transmission fluid, faulty solenoids, or internal damage. Diagnosis required. Could require a simple fluid flush, solenoid replacement, or a transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement)

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 3.6L engine)**

*   **Harsh/Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, hesitation when accelerating, or difficulty finding the correct gear.

    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts/shocks. Replacing in pairs (both front or both rear) is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per pair, depending on the struts/shocks used and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Reduced stability and handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sway bar links. Replacing both links at the same time is recommended.

**Summary**

The 2015 Dodge Journey presents a mixed bag for potential buyers. While it offers practicality and affordability, it is also prone to some significant issues. Engine problems like oil consumption (especially in the 2.4L) and oil filter adapter leaks (3.6L), as well as transmission issues, can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues related to the TIPM are also a common concern. Suspension components such as struts/shocks and sway bar links are known to wear prematurely, adding to the maintenance costs. Although some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like TIPM or transmission replacement, can be quite costly. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used 2015 Journey before purchase, paying close attention to its maintenance history and overall condition.
