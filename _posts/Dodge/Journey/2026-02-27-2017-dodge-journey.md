### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Dodge Journey presents a mixed reliability profile. While its powertrains, particularly the 3.6L V6, are generally robust, owners have reported common issues such as oil and coolant leaks across both engine options. The automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting and overheating. Suspension components like struts and ball joints may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, are also noted. Exterior concerns include potential rust, and interior issues can arise with the HVAC blend doors and infotainment system. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential problems and ensuring the longevity of the vehicle.
