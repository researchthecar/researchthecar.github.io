The 2022 Dodge Journey is a compact SUV, originally praised for its spacious interior and affordability. However, the 2022 model is actually the China-market GAC GS5, rebadged as a Journey for the Mexican market. The sole engine option is a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing approximately 166 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Journey's price point and practicality, but common complaints revolve around its somewhat outdated technology, lack of advanced safety features, and relatively unrefined driving experience.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that their 1.5L turbo engine is consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust pipe can also be a symptom.
    *   Solution: The solution can vary from replacing the PCV valve to replacing the piston rings, or in some cases, engine replacement.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifts, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation during acceleration or when downshifting can also occur.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, the solution could involve a transmission fluid flush, valve body replacement, or in severe cases, a complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear of struts/shocks, ball joints, and control arm bushings leading to clunking noises, uneven tire wear, and compromised handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per component, depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a restart.
    *   Solution: Software updates, resetting the system, or potentially replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. Can be caused by parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw, or replacing the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (battery replacement), or higher depending on the parasitic draw issue.

**Summary**

The 2022 Dodge Journey (rebadged GAC GS5) generally experiences a mix of issues, ranging from minor annoyances to more significant concerns. The excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failure on the 1.5L engine, along with the transmission shifting issues, represent potentially costly repairs. Electrical glitches and suspension wear can also add to the ownership expense. While the Journey's initial price point might be attractive, it's important to factor in the potential repair costs and overall reliability concerns when considering this vehicle. The severity of the issues varies, with some being easily resolved while others could lead to substantial repair bills.
