### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Dodge Journey presents a mixed reliability profile. While the gasoline engines (2.4L, 2.7L, 3.5L) and general exterior/interior components are generally robust, potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 2.0L CRD diesel engine can experience turbocharger and EGR valve problems. Transmission issues, particularly with the 6-speed automatic, such as hesitation and shuddering, are not uncommon and can be costly to repair. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts may require attention. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or premature alternator failure, are also reported. Addressing these potential issues proactively can contribute to a more reliable ownership experience.
