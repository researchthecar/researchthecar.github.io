### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Dodge Journey presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.4L engine is prone to oil leaks and cooling system issues, while both transmission options can experience problems like harsh shifting or hesitation. Suspension components, particularly control arm bushings and strut mounts, are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, are also noted. The 3.6L V6 engine and exterior/interior components generally fare better. Addressing these potential issues proactively can contribute to a more reliable ownership experience.
