**Introduction:** The 2017 Dodge Journey is a midsize SUV available in a variety of trim levels. It comes standard with a 2.4L four-cylinder engine that produces 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. A 3.6L V6 engine producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque is also available, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The Journey has been praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordable price, but it has also received criticism for its lackluster performance and fuel economy.

**Engine**

* **2.4L Four-Cylinder Engine**

    * **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Intake manifold gaskets may fail, causing vacuum leaks and engine performance issues. Symptoms include rough idle, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. The solution involves replacing the failed gaskets. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400
    * **Timing Belt Failure:** Timing belts may fail prematurely, causing catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include engine knocking or rattling, and reduced power. The solution involves replacing the timing belt, tensioner, and water pump. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * **Cylinder Head Failure:** Cylinder heads may crack or warp over time, causing coolant leaks and engine overheating. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and engine knocking. The solution involves replacing the cylinder head. Estimated cost to fix: $2,500 - $4,000+

* **3.6L V6 Engine**

    * **Valve Train Noise:** Valve train components may wear prematurely, causing excessive noise. Symptoms include ticking or clattering sounds from the engine. The solution involves replacing the affected components. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+
    * **Oil Leaks:** Rear main seals or oil pan gaskets may fail, causing oil leaks. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle or low oil levels. The solution involves replacing the failed gaskets or seals. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+
    * **Water Pump Failure:** Water pumps may fail prematurely, causing coolant leaks and engine overheating. Symptoms include coolant loss, engine overheating, and squealing noises. The solution involves replacing the water pump. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $600+

**Transmission**

* **Four-Speed Automatic Transmission**

    * **Gear Slipping:** Gears may slip or shudder during shifting, causing erratic shifting and reduced power. Symptoms include difficulty accelerating or maintaining speed. The solution involves replacing the transmission. Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    * **Torque Converter Failure:** Torque converters may fail, causing shuddering or slipping during acceleration. Symptoms include reduced power, transmission overheating, and delayed shifts. The solution involves replacing the torque converter. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

* **Six-Speed Automatic Transmission**

    * **Shift Solenoid Failure:** Shift solenoids may fail, causing transmission shifting issues. Symptoms include hard shifts, delayed shifts, or slipping gears. The solution involves replacing the affected shift solenoid. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $600+
    * **Clutch Pack Failure:** Clutch packs may wear prematurely, causing slipping or shuddering during shifts. Symptoms include reduced power, transmission overheating, and delayed shifts. The solution involves rebuilding the transmission. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension Strut Failure:** Front suspension struts may fail prematurely, causing a rough ride and poor handling. Symptoms include excessive bouncing, nose diving during braking, and difficulty steering. The solution involves replacing the failed struts. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $800+
* **Rear Suspension Spring Failure:** Rear suspension springs may break or sag over time, reducing ride height and handling. Symptoms include a sagging rear end, reduced ground clearance, and uneven tire wear. The solution involves replacing the failed springs. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Batteries may drain prematurely due to a parasitic draw from the electrical system. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle or a dead battery after駐車ing overnight. The solution involves diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $600+
* **Alternator Failure:** Alternators may fail prematurely, causing insufficient electrical power to the vehicle. Symptoms include dim lights, difficulty starting the vehicle, or a battery warning light on the dashboard. The solution involves replacing the failed alternator. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $800+

**Exterior**

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure:** Door lock actuators may fail, causing difficulty locking or unlocking the doors. Symptoms include inoperable door locks, intermittent locking or unlocking, or a door that remains unlocked. The solution involves replacing the failed actuator. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** Climate control systems may malfunction, causing inconsistent temperature or air flow. Symptoms include difficulty adjusting the temperature, fluctuating air flow, or a lack of air conditioning or heat. The solution involves diagnosing and repairing the faulty component, such as the HVAC control module or blend door actuator. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $800+
* **Dashboard Rattling:** Dashboard panels may rattle or squeak due to loose fasteners or poor assembly. Symptoms include annoying noises while driving on rough roads or over bumps. The solution involves identifying and tightening the loose fasteners or adjusting the dashboard panels. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $300+

**Summary:**

The 2017 Dodge Journey has a variety of potential issues, ranging from minor to severe. Engine and transmission problems can be costly to repair, while electrical and suspension issues are generally less expensive. The cost of repairs will vary depending on the specific issue, parts availability, and labor rates. It's important to factor in the potential cost of repairs when considering purchasing a used Journey, as some issues may be common and expensive to fix.
