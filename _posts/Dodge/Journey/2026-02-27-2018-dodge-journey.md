### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Dodge Journey exhibits a moderate reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly the transmission's shifting behavior and potential overheating. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also frequently reported. While the engines are generally robust, oil and coolant leaks can occur. Suspension components like struts and sway bar links may require replacement over time. The interior can also present minor issues with HVAC and seat heating. Despite these potential drawbacks, the Journey remains a budget-friendly option, but prospective buyers should factor in potential repair costs for these known problem areas.
