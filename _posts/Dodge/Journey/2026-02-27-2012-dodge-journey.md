### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Dodge Journey presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.6L V6 Pentastar engine and the 6-speed automatic transmission are generally considered more robust than the older 2.0L diesel option, which is prone to DPF and EGR issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with power windows and the Uconnect system, are not uncommon. While the suspension, exterior, and interior components tend to be reliable, potential buyers should be mindful of the specific powertrain and be prepared for potential transmission issues with the 62TE automatic. Regular maintenance is crucial for mitigating many of these potential problems.
