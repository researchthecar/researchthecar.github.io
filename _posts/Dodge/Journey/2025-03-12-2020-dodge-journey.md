Here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2020 Dodge Journey, organized by category. The 2020 Dodge Journey is a mid-size SUV known for its affordability and spacious interior. It comes with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine that produces 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. While offering a budget-friendly option for families needing a larger vehicle, the Journey has faced criticisms for its dated design, subpar fuel economy, and overall performance compared to its competitors. Some owners appreciate its ease of use and available third-row seating, while others express concerns about reliability and safety ratings.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.4L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil warning light, unusual engine noises, or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address any leaks promptly. If consumption is excessive, a compression test can help determine the source. Repairs might range from replacing valve stem seals to more extensive engine work, such as piston ring replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can occur, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating. These can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific cylinder(s) misfiring and replace the faulty components (ignition coil, spark plug, fuel injector). A thorough diagnostic scan can pinpoint the cause.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between gears. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds.
    * Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter change may improve shifting. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal wear may require professional diagnosis and repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (fluid flush); $500 - $2000+ (valve body/internal repairs)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping occurs when the engine revs without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This can be accompanied by delayed engagement or a general lack of power.
    * Solution: Similar to harsh shifting, start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. Transmission slipping often indicates more significant internal wear or damage, potentially requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension components such as ball joints, tie rod ends, and struts. This can result in clunking noises when driving over bumps, uneven tire wear, and diminished handling.
    * Solution: Regular inspections of the suspension system are crucial. Replace worn components as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the component and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report premature battery drain or failure, leading to starting problems. This can be exacerbated by frequent short trips or parasitic draws.
    * Solution: Have the battery tested to determine its condition. Check for any parasitic draws draining the battery when the vehicle is off. Consider upgrading to a higher-capacity battery if needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (battery replacement); $100 - $500+ (diagnosing/fixing parasitic draw)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Uconnect System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system can experience glitches, such as freezing, slow response times, or failure to connect to Bluetooth devices.
    * Solution: Try restarting the Uconnect system or performing a factory reset. Check for available software updates. If the problem persists, the Uconnect module may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software updates/reset); $300 - $1000+ (module replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: In some climates, the dashboard material can be prone to cracking, especially when exposed to prolonged sunlight.
    * Solution: Use a dashboard protectant regularly. Repair or replacement of the dashboard is an option but can be costly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (repair); $500 - $1500+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Dodge Journey presents several potential issues that buyers should be aware of. The most prevalent problems seem to revolve around the engine and transmission, including oil consumption, misfires, and shifting issues. Suspension components are also prone to premature wear, while electrical glitches with the battery and Uconnect system can be frustrating. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission work can easily exceed several thousand dollars. Due to the cost, it is very important to have the car inspected by a trusted mechanic.
