The shifting problems and torque converter failures on the six-speed automatic transmission can also result in expensive repairs. Rust formation on the lower body is another common complaint, while other issues such as battery drain, alternator failure, and dashboard rattle are less severe but can still be annoying. Overall, the 2014 Dodge Journey has a mixed reliability record, and potential buyers should be aware of the potential issues before making a purchase decision.
