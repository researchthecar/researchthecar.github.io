### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Dodge Journey presents a mixed reliability profile. While the powertrain options are generally understood, common issues like oil leaks and cooling system problems can arise with both the 2.4L and 3.6L engines. The 6-speed automatic transmission is a frequent source of complaints, with shifting issues and overheating being notable concerns. Suspension components, particularly struts and ball joints, may require attention as the vehicle ages. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also reported. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates, and interior wear is typical for a vehicle of this age. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs and prioritize vehicles with a well-documented service history.
