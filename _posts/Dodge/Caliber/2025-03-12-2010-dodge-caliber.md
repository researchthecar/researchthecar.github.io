Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2010 Dodge Caliber, formatted as requested.

The 2010 Dodge Caliber is a compact hatchback that aimed for a blend of affordability and versatility. Available engine options included a 1.8-liter inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter inline-4 making 158 hp and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter inline-4 generating 172 hp and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices consisted of a 5-speed manual (depending on the engine) and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Drivers often appreciated the Caliber's distinctive styling and cargo space, while common criticisms revolved around its lackluster fuel economy, engine performance, and interior quality.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes. This may be indicated by low oil level warnings or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing piston rings or valve seals may be necessary. In severe cases, engine replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling/Rough Idling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly or exhibit a rough idle, often accompanied by a check engine light. This could be due to issues with the throttle body or mass airflow sensor.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the throttle body or mass airflow sensor. Diagnosing and repairing any vacuum leaks can also resolve this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Slipping/Jerking/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission may exhibit slipping, jerking, or hesitation during acceleration. In severe cases, the transmission may fail altogether, resulting in a loss of drive.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change may help in some cases. However, complete CVT replacement or rebuild is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $400 for fluid changes, $2500 - $5000+ for replacement/rebuild
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A loud whining noise coming from the transmission, especially during acceleration. This often indicates internal wear or damage within the CVT.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid change may temporarily alleviate the noise. However, complete CVT replacement or rebuild is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $400 for fluid changes, $2500 - $5000+ for replacement/rebuild
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. This can be caused by worn-out struts, shocks, ball joints, or control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 per component, depending on the specific part and labor costs
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM can cause a variety of electrical problems, including fuel pump relay failure (leading to stalling or no-start conditions), intermittent starting issues, and malfunctioning accessories.
    *   Solution: Replacing the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found. (Note: There have been class-action lawsuits regarding TIPM issues in Chrysler vehicles, but not necessarily specific recalls for the 2010 Caliber.)

*   **Windshield Wiper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The windshield wipers may stop working intermittently or completely, often due to a faulty wiper motor or linkage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the wiper motor or repairing the linkage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch latch may fail, making it difficult or impossible to open the hatch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hatch latch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard may develop cracks, especially in warmer climates. This is a cosmetic issue but can detract from the vehicle's appearance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard (expensive) or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $30 - $150 for a cover, $500 - $1500+ for replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner may begin to sag or detach from the roof of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Re-gluing the headliner or replacing it entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Dodge Caliber, while offering a unique design and practicality, is prone to several issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the CVT transmission, which can suffer from slipping, jerking, and eventual failure, potentially leading to costly repairs. Engine issues such as excessive oil consumption and electrical problems related to the TIPM are also common. Suspension wear and tear is typical for a vehicle of this age. The severity and cost of these issues range from minor cosmetic problems to major mechanical failures. Buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic before making a decision.
