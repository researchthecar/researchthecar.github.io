Transmission options were a 5-speed manual or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT).

**Summary**

The 2008 Dodge Caliber, while offering a unique style and affordable price point, is plagued by several reliability issues. The most significant concern is the high failure rate of the CVT transmission, which can be a very costly repair. Electrical issues, particularly with the WIN and TIPM modules, are also common. While some issues, such as sway bar bushings and the rear wiper motor, are relatively inexpensive to fix, others like the dashboard cracking are more cosmetic and might be ignored. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the potential cost of repairs when considering purchasing a 2008 Dodge Caliber, especially those equipped with a CVT.
