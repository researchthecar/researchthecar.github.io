### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Dodge Caliber presents a mixed reliability profile. While its engines (1.8L, 2.0L, 2.4L) can be prone to oil and cooling system leaks, and the CVT transmission is a common source of concern with hesitation and overheating, other areas show more promise. The manual transmissions are generally more robust. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear prematurely, and electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior paint can be susceptible to rust, and interior components like the blower motor may fail. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
