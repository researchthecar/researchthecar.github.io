Here is a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2011 Dodge Caliber, categorized by major components.

The 2011 Dodge Caliber is a compact hatchback that was offered with several engine and transmission options. Engine choices included a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine generating 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciated the Caliber's affordability and cargo space, but often cited its lackluster performance, cheap interior materials, and reliability issues as major drawbacks.

**Engine**

**2.0L I4 Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can cause rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light to illuminate. Common causes include faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors. Diagnosis may require a scan tool to identify the affected cylinder.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or crankshaft seal. Visible oil spots under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Thorough cleaning of the affected area is often necessary to confirm the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L I4 Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.0L engine, misfires can cause rough idling, reduced fuel economy, and illumination of the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors. Diagnosis may require a scan tool to pinpoint the problematic cylinder.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from areas like the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or crankshaft seal are common. Look for oil spots, a burning oil smell, and check oil levels regularly.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Clean the area to verify the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT is known for issues. Common symptoms include slipping, jerking, hesitation, whining noises, and complete failure. The transmission may enter limp mode, restricting vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or fluid change might temporarily alleviate the issue. However, complete replacement or a costly rebuild of the CVT is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $7000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT can overheat, especially under demanding conditions (e.g., towing, prolonged high-speed driving). This can lead to reduced performance and potential damage to the transmission.
    *   Solution: Install an aftermarket transmission cooler to help regulate CVT temperature. Ensure regular CVT fluid changes with the correct type of fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (cooler installation)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and uneven tire wear are indicators of worn struts or shocks.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks. Consider replacing them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Bushings (Control Arms, Sway Bar)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps, can indicate worn bushings. This can affect handling and stability.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings. In some cases, it may be more cost-effective to replace the entire control arm or sway bar link assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (per component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TIPM is a common source of electrical problems. Symptoms can include difficulty starting, stalling, fuel pump relay failure, intermittent headlight or taillight operation, and malfunctioning power windows or locks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM is often necessary. Some repair shops specialize in rebuilding TIPMs, which can be a more affordable option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (replacement or rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Speed Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the ABS, traction control, or speedometer can be caused by a faulty wheel speed sensor. The ABS warning light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the defective wheel speed sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on various body panels, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust repair can range from sanding and painting to replacing entire body panels.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack, particularly in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard is an option but can be expensive. A dashboard cover is a more affordable alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate, often due to a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the defective window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Dodge Caliber presents a mixed bag. While affordable, it suffers from notable reliability issues, particularly with the CVT transmission and TIPM. Engine oil leaks and suspension wear are also common. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but CVT repairs can be very expensive. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the cost of potential repairs when considering this vehicle.
