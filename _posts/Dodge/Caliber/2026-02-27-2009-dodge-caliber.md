### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Dodge Caliber presents a mixed reliability profile. While the gasoline engines (1.8L, 2.0L, 2.4L) are generally straightforward, they can be prone to oil and coolant leaks. The CVT transmission is a notable weak point, with reports of shuddering and outright failure, making manual transmissions a potentially more robust choice. The diesel engine, while offering better fuel economy, introduces potential issues with the turbocharger and DPF system. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear out, and electrical gremlins such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster problems are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs, especially if considering a model with the CVT.
