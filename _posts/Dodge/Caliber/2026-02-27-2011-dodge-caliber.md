### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Dodge Caliber exhibits a range of reliability concerns, with the CVT transmission being a notable area for potential issues such as shuddering and overheating. Engine oil and coolant leaks are also commonly reported across all engine options. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear prematurely, leading to ride quality and safety concerns. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and instrument clusters, add to the potential repair list. While the exterior generally holds up well, interior components like the HVAC blower motor and door lock actuators are also prone to failure. Prospective buyers should carefully consider these potential maintenance costs and prioritize vehicles with a documented service history.
