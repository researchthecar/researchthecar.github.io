The 2007 Dodge Caliber was a compact hatchback offered in various trims, including SE, SXT, R/T, and SRT4. It was somewhat popular for its distinctive styling and relatively affordable price point. However, it received mixed reviews regarding its performance and reliability. Some drivers appreciated its cargo space and unique design, while others criticized its lackluster engine performance, cheap interior materials, and numerous reliability issues. Available engines included a 1.8L inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque (available in some markets), a 2.0L inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, a 2.4L inline-4 producing 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque (R/T model), and a turbocharged 2.4L inline-4 producing 285 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque (SRT4 model). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT).
