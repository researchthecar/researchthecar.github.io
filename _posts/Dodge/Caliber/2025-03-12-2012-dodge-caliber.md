The 2012 Dodge Caliber is a compact hatchback that offered a mix of practicality and affordability. The base engine was a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque. An optional 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine produced 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual transmission and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Caliber's spacious interior and cargo area for its class. However, common complaints revolve around the CVT's performance, the engine's lackluster power, and overall build quality. The Caliber was discontinued after 2012 and replaced with the Dodge Dart.
