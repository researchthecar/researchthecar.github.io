### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Dodge Caliber presents a mixed reliability profile. While its gasoline engines (1.8L, 2.0L, 2.4L) and manual transmission are generally robust, the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) has been a notable weak point, with reports of leaks and overheating issues that can be costly to repair. Suspension components, specifically strut mount bearings, can also develop problems leading to noise. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster issues, are also documented. Owners should pay close attention to the CVT's health and be prepared for potential electrical and suspension repairs. Overall, it's a budget-friendly vehicle, but potential buyers should factor in the possibility of these specific repairs.
