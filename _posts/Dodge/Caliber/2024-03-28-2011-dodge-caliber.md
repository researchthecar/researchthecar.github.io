**Introduction**

The 2011 Dodge Caliber is a compact crossover SUV known for its affordability and practicality. It comes with two engine choices: a 2.0L I-4 producing 158 hp and 141 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4L I-4 producing 172 hp and 165 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine is paired with either a 5-speed manual or a CVT, while the 2.4L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. While the Caliber has received positive feedback for its spacious cabin and comfortable ride quality, it has also faced criticism for its lack of power and poor fuel economy.
