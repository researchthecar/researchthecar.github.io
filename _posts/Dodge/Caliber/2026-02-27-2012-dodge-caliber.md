### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Dodge Caliber exhibits a moderate level of reliability, with several common issues that owners should be aware of. The powertrain, particularly the CVT transmission, is a frequent source of concern, with potential for slipping and overheating. Engine oil leaks and cooling system problems are also noted across various engine options. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear prematurely, leading to ride quality issues and potential safety concerns. Electrical problems, especially related to the Body Control Module and alternator, can cause a range of frustrating malfunctions. While the exterior can be susceptible to rust, and interior upholstery may show early wear, these are generally less critical than mechanical or electrical failures. Prospective buyers should factor in potential repair costs for these common issues.
