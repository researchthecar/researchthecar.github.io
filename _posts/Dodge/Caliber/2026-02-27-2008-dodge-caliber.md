### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Dodge Caliber presents a mixed reliability profile. While its engines (1.8L, 2.0L, 2.4L) are generally robust, common issues like oil leaks and cooling system problems can arise. The performance-oriented 2.0L Turbo engine in the SRT-4 models introduces potential turbocharger and clutch wear concerns. The CVT transmission is a notable weak point, with reports of hesitation, jerking, and overheating, often requiring costly repairs. Manual transmissions are more straightforward but can experience clutch wear. Suspension components like struts and sway bar links are typical wear items. Electrical issues, particularly with window regulators and instrument clusters, are also reported. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor can fail. Overall, the Caliber can be an economical choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific transmission and electrical vulnerabilities.
