### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Dodge Stratus presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine (head gaskets, timing belts, oil leaks), transmission (slipping, torque converter problems), and certain electrical components like the Body Control Module and alternator. Suspension wear, particularly ball joints and tie rods, is also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the blower motor and dashboard materials may degrade over time. While not inherently unreliable, potential buyers should be aware of these common problem areas and factor in potential repair costs for a vehicle of this age.
