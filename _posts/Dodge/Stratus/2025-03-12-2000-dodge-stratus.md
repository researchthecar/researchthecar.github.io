The 2000 Dodge Stratus was a mid-size sedan known for its affordability and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4, a 2.4L inline-4, and a 2.7L V6. The 2.0L engine produced around 132 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual (only with the 2.0L) and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally liked the Stratus' spacious interior and decent fuel economy for its class, but common complaints included build quality issues, electrical problems, and the unrefined nature of some of the engines.
