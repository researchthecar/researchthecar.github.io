### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Dodge Stratus, while offering an economical entry into car ownership, presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly head gasket failures on the 2.0L and timing belt concerns on the 2.4L. The V6 engines can also experience intake manifold leaks. Automatic transmissions are prone to slipping and torque converter issues. Beyond the engine and transmission, suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and window regulators, can also arise. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior wear, particularly on seats, is typical for its age. Prospective buyers should budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the engine and transmission, and thoroughly inspect any vehicle for these known issues.
