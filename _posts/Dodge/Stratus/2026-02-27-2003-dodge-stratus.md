### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Dodge Stratus, while offering accessible transportation, presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly oil leaks across all engine variants and potential transmission problems like slipping or harsh shifting. Suspension components, such as ball joints and tie rods, can also wear prematurely. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module or alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate, and interior components like the HVAC blower resistor and dashboard materials may require attention. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect any 2003 Stratus for these potential issues and factor in possible repair costs.
