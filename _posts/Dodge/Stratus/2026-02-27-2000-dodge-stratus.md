### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Dodge Stratus can be a budget-friendly vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 2.4L engine is more prone to timing belt issues and oil sludge if not maintained, while the 2.0L can suffer from head gasket problems. Automatic transmissions may develop slipping or torque converter issues. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also known to wear out. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on the vehicle's climate history. While interior wear is typical, HVAC blower motor failure is a notable issue. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a commitment to regular maintenance are highly recommended for this model.
