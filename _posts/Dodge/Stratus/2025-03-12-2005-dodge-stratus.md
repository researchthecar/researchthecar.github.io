The 2005 Dodge Stratus, available as both a sedan and a coupe, offered a mix of affordability and reasonable comfort for its time. Engine choices included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 hp and 167 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 making 200 hp and 190 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 generating 210 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options varied depending on the engine. Owners often appreciated the Stratus's spacious interior and relatively smooth ride, but common criticisms included lackluster build quality, uninspired handling, and some reliability concerns.
