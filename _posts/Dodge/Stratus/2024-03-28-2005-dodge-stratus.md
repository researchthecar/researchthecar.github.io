**Introduction:**

The 2005 Dodge Stratus is a mid-size sedan that was offered with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The base engine was a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that produced 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine was a 3.0-liter V6 that produced 200 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual transmission.

Owners of the 2005 Dodge Stratus generally praise the vehicle for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and affordable price. However, the Stratus has also been criticized for its lack of power, particularly with the base four-cylinder engine.
