### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Dodge Stratus presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.4L engine is generally more reliable than the 2.7L V6, which is prone to head gasket issues and oil sludge. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic, can lead to costly repairs. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and power windows, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, potential buyers should be aware of the powertrain and suspension vulnerabilities, especially with higher mileage vehicles.
