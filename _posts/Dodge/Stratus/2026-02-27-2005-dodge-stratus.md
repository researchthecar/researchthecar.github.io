### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Dodge Stratus presents a mixed bag of reliability. While the core structure and basic operation are generally sound, owners should be aware of potential issues with the automatic transmission, particularly concerning gear slipping and torque converter problems. Engine-wise, the 2.4L and 2.0L engines can be prone to head gasket and timing belt issues respectively, while the V6 may experience intake manifold leaks. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Regular maintenance, especially for the engine and transmission, is crucial for mitigating these potential problems and ensuring a longer lifespan for the vehicle.
