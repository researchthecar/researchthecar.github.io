The 2002 Dodge Ram 4000, also known as the Ram 3500 in the US market, is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse nature. While engine options varied, the 5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel inline-6 was a popular choice, delivering around 235-245 horsepower and 460-505 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific year and calibration. Other engine options included the 5.9L Magnum V8 and the 8.0L Magnum V10. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Ram 4000 for its towing capacity and ruggedness, but some common complaints centered around reliability issues, particularly with the automatic transmission and some engine components.

**Engine**

**5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel**

*   **Lift Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The lift pump, responsible for supplying fuel to the injection pump, is prone to failure. Symptoms include hard starting, stalling, loss of power, and excessive engine knocking. A failed lift pump can starve the injection pump of fuel, leading to further damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the lift pump. Upgrading to an aftermarket, higher-flow lift pump mounted closer to the fuel tank is a common solution to improve reliability and prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VP44 Injection Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VP44 injection pump is a complex electronic fuel injection pump. Common symptoms of failure include hard starting, stalling, loss of power, rough idling, and a check engine light. A failing VP44 can also cause excessive smoke.
    *   Solution: Replace the VP44 injection pump. This is a complex repair that often requires specialized tools and knowledge.
