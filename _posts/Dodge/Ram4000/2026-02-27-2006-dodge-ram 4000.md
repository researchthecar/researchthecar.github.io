### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Dodge Ram 4000, particularly with the 5.9L Cummins engine, is known for its robust powertrain but is not immune to specific issues. Common problems include injector failures, turbocharger wear, and potential head gasket issues on the diesel engines, which can be costly to repair. The manual transmissions, while generally durable, can suffer from clutch wear and input shaft bearing problems. The automatic transmission may experience torque converter or solenoid issues. Suspension components like leaf springs can break under heavy load, and frame rust is a concern in corrosive environments. Electrical issues like alternator failure are also reported. Interior wear is typical for a work vehicle. Overall, the Ram 4000 is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of these potential reliability concerns and budget for maintenance and repairs, especially on higher-mileage units.
