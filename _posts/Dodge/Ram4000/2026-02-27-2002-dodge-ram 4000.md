### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Dodge Ram 4000, particularly with the 5.9L Cummins engine, is known for its durability in heavy-duty applications. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as injector and fuel pump problems with the diesel, and head gasket or ignition issues with the V10. Manual transmissions can experience synchronizer wear, while automatics may have torque converter or solenoid pack issues. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can wear over time. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and alternator failures are also noted. Exterior rust, especially on lower body panels, and interior HVAC blend door failures are other areas to inspect. Despite these points, with proper maintenance and addressing these specific issues, the Ram 4000 can remain a reliable workhorse.
