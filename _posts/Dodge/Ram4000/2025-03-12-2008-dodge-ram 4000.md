The 2008 Dodge Ram 4000, also known as the Ram Chassis Cab, is a heavy-duty truck designed for commercial applications. It was available with a few engine options, most commonly the 5.7L Hemi V8 producing 345 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included a 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel inline-6 and a 4.7L V8. Transmission options included a 5-speed automatic and a 6-speed manual, depending on the engine choice. Owners often appreciate the Ram 4000's robust build, towing capacity, and overall workhorse capabilities. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially with the gas engines), ride quality (inherent in a heavy-duty truck), and some reliability concerns.
