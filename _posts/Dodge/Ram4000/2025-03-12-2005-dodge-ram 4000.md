The 2005 Dodge Ram 4000 was available with several engine options, including the 3.7L Magnum V6, the 4.7L Magnum V8, and the 5.7L HEMI V8. The 3.7L V6 produced around 215 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (depending on the engine). Owners often praised the Ram 4000 for its powerful engine options (especially the HEMI), its comfortable ride, and its truck-like capabilities. Common complaints included issues with fuel economy, some reliability concerns, and potential for rust.

**Engine**

**3.7L Magnum V6**

*   **Cracked Exhaust Manifolds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, especially on cold starts, exhaust leak smell, reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked exhaust manifold(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ (depending on whether you replace both manifolds and use aftermarket parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.7L Magnum V8**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine knocking, reduced oil pressure, potential for engine failure. Often caused by infrequent oil changes.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil, engine flush (proceed with caution), or in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil change) - $300 (engine flush) - $3,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup. Potential for serious engine damage if the timing chain jumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, guides, and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **HEMI Tick (Exhaust Manifold Bolts)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A distinct "tick" sound, especially noticeable at idle and low speeds. Often caused by broken exhaust manifold bolts, leading to exhaust leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold bolts with updated, stronger bolts. Sometimes, the exhaust manifold itself needs to be replaced if warped or cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on whether the manifold needs replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Seat Failure**

    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change, valve body repair or replacement, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (flush) - $500 (valve body) - $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual (NV3500)**

*   **Gear Grinding/Difficulty Shifting**

**Summary**

The 2005 Dodge Ram 4000 has several known issues, with the engine and transmission being primary areas of concern. Exhaust manifold issues on both V6 and V8 engines, sludge buildup in the 4.7L V8, and potential valve seat issues in the 5.7L HEMI are significant. Transmission slipping and hard shifting can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical problems such as ball joint failure and instrument cluster issues are also common. Rust, particularly in areas with road salt, is a major concern. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to substantial repair bills, so a thorough inspection is essential before purchasing a used 2005 Dodge Ram 4000.
