### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Dodge Ram 4000 demonstrates a mixed reliability profile, with its heavy-duty diesel engine (6.7L Cummins) being a common source of potential issues such as fuel injector problems and EGR system clogging. The automatic transmission (68RFE) can also present challenges with torque converter and fluid leak issues. Manual transmissions are generally more robust but can experience clutch wear. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs and ball joints, may require attention due to the truck's work-oriented nature. Electrical issues like alternator failure are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. Overall, while capable, owners should be prepared for potential maintenance on powertrain and suspension elements, especially with high mileage or heavy usage.
