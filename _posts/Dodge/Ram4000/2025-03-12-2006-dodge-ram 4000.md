The 2006 Dodge Ram 4000, also known as the Ram Chassis Cab, is a heavy-duty work truck designed for commercial use. While primarily equipped with a 5.7L Hemi V8 producing 345 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque or a 5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel engine, offering substantial towing and payload capabilities, the 2006 Ram 4000 also offered a 8.0L Magnum V10 engine. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic, and a 6-speed manual (diesel only). Owners often appreciate the Ram 4000's robust build and towing capacity. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engines), and the cost of maintaining a heavy-duty work truck.

**Engine**

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or tapping sound emanating from the engine, often more pronounced at idle and low RPM. The noise is usually attributed to worn rocker arms, lifters, or exhaust manifold bolts breaking.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty rocker arms, lifters, or exhaust manifold bolts. Addressing the underlying cause of the ticking sound is crucial to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, especially on cold starts, caused by exhaust leaks. Broken or cracked exhaust manifold bolts are a common issue.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken exhaust manifold bolts and possibly the exhaust manifold if it's warped. Upgrading to stronger bolts is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel**

*   **Lift Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, hard starting, or stalling. The lift pump, responsible for delivering fuel to the injection pump, can fail prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replacing the lift pump. Upgrading to an aftermarket, higher-flowing lift pump is a common solution to improve reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, excessive smoke (white or black), reduced fuel economy. The Cummins engine is sensitive to fuel quality, and injectors can become clogged or damaged over time.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the fuel injectors. Using a fuel additive to improve fuel quality can help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic or harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to engage gears. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low fluid level.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission service, including fluid and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnosis and repair of the valve body or clutch packs may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (service) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints and tie rod ends. A front-end alignment is necessary after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging or Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced load-carrying capacity, sagging rear end, and rough ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs or adding helper springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, including fuel pump relay failure, starting issues, and malfunctioning accessories.

**Summary**

The 2006 Dodge Ram 4000, while a capable work truck, exhibits several common issues. Engine-related problems, especially with the 5.7L Hemi V8 and 5.9L Cummins, and electrical issues involving the TIPM are prevalent. Suspension wear and rust are also significant concerns. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but owners should be prepared for potentially expensive maintenance, particularly if the vehicle has seen heavy use or is located in a region with harsh weather conditions.
