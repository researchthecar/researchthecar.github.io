The 2000 Dodge Ram 4000, also known as the Ram 3500 in some markets, is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its ruggedness and towing capabilities. The 2000 model year offered several engine options, including the 5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel inline-six, the 5.9L Magnum V8, and the 8.0L Magnum V10. The 5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel produces approximately 235 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options generally included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Ram 4000 for its powerful engines, especially the Cummins diesel, and its ability to handle heavy loads. Common complaints include issues with front-end components and general wear and tear associated with a heavy-duty truck of that age.
