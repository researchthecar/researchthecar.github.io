The 2010 Dodge Ram 4000 is a heavy-duty chassis cab truck designed for commercial use. The 2010 model year offered three engine options: a 5.7L Hemi V8 producing 330 hp and 375 lb-ft of torque, a 5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6 producing 350 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6 producing 350 hp and 650-800 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed automatic and a 6-speed automatic, depending on the engine. Owners appreciate the Ram 4000's robust capabilities and workhorse nature, but often complain about its rough ride, lower fuel economy, and potential for costly repairs associated with heavy-duty components.

**Engine**

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick/Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold, and exhaust leaks. This is often caused by broken exhaust manifold bolts or failing exhaust manifold gaskets.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken manifold bolts and/or exhaust manifold gasket(s). Some opt for aftermarket headers to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6**

No Issues Found

**6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, whistling noises from the turbocharger, and potentially turbocharger failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Proper maintenance, including regular oil changes, can help prevent this.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, engine stalling, and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. Also, inspect the EGR cooler for leaks or blockage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Dodge Ram 4000, while a capable work truck, presents owners with several potential issues. Engine problems on both gas and diesel models can be costly, particularly turbocharger failures and fuel injector replacements on the Cummins. Transmission issues, primarily with the 6-speed automatic, can also lead to significant repair bills. Electrical problems stemming from the TIPM can be frustrating and difficult to diagnose. Suspension wear is common, given the truck's heavy-duty nature. Rust, dashboard cracking are also present. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can require considerable investment, making careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection crucial.
