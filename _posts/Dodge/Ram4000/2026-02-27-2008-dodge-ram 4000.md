### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Dodge Ram 4000, particularly with its Cummins diesel engines, is generally considered a robust workhorse. However, common issues tend to revolve around the complex emissions systems (DPF, EGR) on the 6.7L engine, and potential wear on injectors and turbochargers for both diesel variants. Transmission reliability is decent, but manual clutches and automatic torque converters/valve bodies can require attention. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are subject to wear due to the truck's intended use. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, and body corrosion are also points to monitor. Overall, while capable, owners should be prepared for maintenance related to heavy-duty operation and diesel engine specifics.
