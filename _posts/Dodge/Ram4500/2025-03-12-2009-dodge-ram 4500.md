The 2009 Dodge Ram 4500 is a heavy-duty truck designed for commercial applications, offering robust capabilities for towing and hauling. Engine options for this model year include the 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel, producing around 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. A gasoline engine was also available but less common, and for this analysis, we will focus on the diesel powertrain due to its prevalence. Owners generally appreciate the Ram 4500 for its workhorse capabilities, sturdy build, and towing capacity. Common complaints include the rough ride, fuel economy (especially when towing), and some reliability concerns related to emissions equipment and certain electronic components. Transmission options were primarily automatic, usually an Aisin AS69RC transmission or a 68RFE transmission.

**Engine**

**6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel**

* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and a check engine light may illuminate. The EGR cooler is prone to cracking, leading to coolant leaks into the exhaust system.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty EGR cooler with an updated or aftermarket unit. Some owners opt for EGR delete kits (check local regulations).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine knocking. Fuel injectors can become clogged or fail due to fuel contamination or general wear.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) and replace them. Ensure the fuel system is clean and the fuel filter is regularly replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per injector (including labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the turbo, loss of power, excessive smoke, and potentially a check engine light. Turbochargers can fail due to oil starvation, contamination, or general wear.
    * Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Inspect the oil supply line for blockages.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin AS69RC**

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, especially at lower speeds. Can lead to complete transmission failure if not addressed.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter. Flush the transmission fluid and replace the filter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping gears, or failure to shift at all.
    * Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**68RFE**
* **Overdrive Clutch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping in overdrive, inability to shift into overdrive, or harsh shifting. This can be caused by overheating or wear.
    * Solution: Replace the overdrive clutches, steels, and seals.  A complete rebuild may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Ball Joint Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, excessive tire wear, and loose steering. The heavy-duty nature of the Ram 4500 puts stress on the ball joints, leading to premature wear.
    * Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty ball joints for improved durability.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load capacity, and potential leaf spring cracking. Heavy loads can cause the leaf springs to weaken over time.
    * Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty leaf springs for increased load capacity and durability.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500 per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting problems, fuel pump relay failure, power window/door lock malfunctions, and other electrical gremlins. The TIPM is a common source of electrical issues in many Chrysler/Dodge vehicles.
    * Solution: Replace the TIPM. Some owners attempt to repair the fuel pump relay internally, but replacement is generally recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Wiring Harness Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as lights not working, sensors malfunctioning, or communication errors.
    * Solution: Inspect and repair damaged wiring harnesses. Replace corroded connectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and location of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Cab Corners and Rocker Panels**

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Dodge Ram 4500 is a capable work truck that may present several common issues as it ages. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine (EGR cooler, fuel injectors, turbocharger) and transmission (torque converter, valve body), which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues related to the TIPM are also a frequent complaint. Suspension wear is typical for a heavy-duty truck, and rust can be a problem in certain climates. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major failures. The estimated cost to fix these issues varies widely, from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the problem and the repair shop. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and address any known issues before purchasing.
