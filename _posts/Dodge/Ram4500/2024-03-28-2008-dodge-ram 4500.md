**Introduction:**

The 2008 Dodge Ram 4500 is a heavy-duty pickup truck that is available in regular cab, crew cab, and mega cab configurations. It is powered by a standard 5.9L Cummins Turbo Diesel inline-6 engine that produces 325 horsepower and 610 lb-ft of torque when paired with the manual transmission, or 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque with the automatic transmission. The Ram 4500 is also available with a 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel Inline-6 engine that generates 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque with either transmission. Both engines are mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission.

Owners often praise the Ram 4500 for its powerful engines, comfortable interior, and towing and hauling capabilities. However, it has received some criticism for its outdated design and limited fuel economy.
