The 2008 Dodge Ram 4500 is a heavy-duty truck designed for commercial and demanding applications. Engine options included a 6.7L Cummins turbodiesel inline-six, producing 305-350 horsepower and 610-650 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L Hemi V8 gasoline engine that generated 330 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were typically a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Ram 4500 for its towing capacity and robust build, while common complaints include its fuel economy, turning radius, and overall size, which can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Summary**

The 2008 Dodge Ram 4500 can be a capable work truck, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. Engine-related problems, especially with the 6.7L Cummins, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the Aisin automatic, are also a concern. Electrical problems stemming from the TIPM can be frustrating and require professional diagnosis. Suspension components are prone to wear, given the truck's heavy-duty nature. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant expenses. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
