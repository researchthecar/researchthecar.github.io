The 2003 Dodge SX 2.0, also known as the Neon in some markets, was a compact car aimed at fuel efficiency and affordability. The most common engine was a 2.0L Inline-4 engine that produced roughly 130 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. A less common engine, a 2.4L Inline-4 engine produced 150 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. People generally liked the SX 2.0 for its affordability, decent fuel economy, and relatively sporty handling for its class. Common dislikes included the somewhat bland interior, potential for rust, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2003 Dodge SX 2.0 has several common issues. The 2.0L engine is prone to sensor failures, while the 4-speed automatic transmission can experience torque converter and shift solenoid problems. Suspension issues like strut mount and sway bar link failures are also reported. Electrical problems, such as instrument cluster malfunctions and window regulator failures, can occur. Rust is a common issue. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues vary. Addressing these problems can range from relatively inexpensive sensor replacements to more costly transmission or suspension repairs, which can impact the overall ownership experience.
