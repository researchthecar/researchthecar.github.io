### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Dodge SX 2.0 is a vehicle that, while offering affordability, presents several common reliability concerns. Owners should be aware of potential issues with oil and coolant leaks from the engine, as well as transmission problems like harsh shifting or clutch wear, especially on higher mileage examples. Suspension components such as ball joints and strut mounts can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the HVAC blower resistor and dashboard materials may degrade over time. Proactive maintenance and addressing these specific issues promptly can help mitigate larger repair costs and ensure continued serviceability.
