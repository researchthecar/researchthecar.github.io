The 2018 Dodge Neon, while not officially sold in North America under the Dodge nameplate, is a rebadged Fiat Tipo sold primarily in Mexico and the Middle East. It's known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and relatively affordable price point. However, some common complaints include the somewhat bland styling, limited availability of advanced technology features compared to competitors, and potentially lackluster performance from the base engine. For the 2018 model year, the primary engine option was a 1.6L E.torQ inline-4 producing around 110 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms can include the low oil light illuminating on the dashboard, and visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings has been reported to solve the issue, however this is a very involved repair. A leak-down test can help determine the health of the cylinders and rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the catalytic converter. Symptoms include a check engine light, decreased engine performance, and potentially failing emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears.
    *   Solution: Some have reported that a transmission fluid flush and filter change alleviates the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300 (Fluid/Filter), $800 - $1500+ (Valve Body), $2500 - $4500+ (Rebuild/Replace)

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, leading to clunking noises, imprecise handling, and potential alignment issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings. In some cases, replacing the entire control arm assembly might be more cost-effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per bushing/control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**Summary**

The 2018 Dodge Neon, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, appears to have a few potential issues owners should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around excessive oil consumption in the 1.6L engine and potential rough shifting with the 6-speed automatic transmission. Premature suspension bushing wear and infotainment system glitches are also noted. While none of these issues appear to be universally prevalent, the potential costs for repairs, particularly those involving the engine and transmission, could be significant. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and inquire about maintenance history to mitigate risks.
