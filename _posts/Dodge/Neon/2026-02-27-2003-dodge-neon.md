### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Dodge Neon presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues revolve around the engine, particularly head gasket failures and oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, can experience wear and tear leading to shifting problems or clutch/torque converter issues. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on the climate. While the SRT-4 variant offers performance, it introduces its own set of potential turbo and cylinder head issues. Overall, the Neon can be an economical choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these recurring problems and budget for potential repairs.
