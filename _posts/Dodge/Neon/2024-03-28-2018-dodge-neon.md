**Introduction:**

The 2018 Dodge Neon is not available in the United States. It was only produced for sale in Mexico, Canada, and South America. It was offered with two engine options: a 1.6-liter four-cylinder and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Transmission options included a six-speed manual, a CVT, and a six-speed automatic. The 1.6-liter engine produces 110 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.0-liter engine produces 148 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque. The Neon has a reputation for being a reliable and fuel-efficient vehicle, with a comfortable interior and a spacious trunk. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of power and its somewhat bland exterior design.
