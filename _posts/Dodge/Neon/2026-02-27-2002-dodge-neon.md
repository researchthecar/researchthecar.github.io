### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Dodge Neon, while offering an engaging driving experience for its class, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of its age and segment. Engine issues, particularly head gasket failures and oil leaks, are notable. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic variant, can lead to costly repairs. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, can cause frustration. Exterior rust and interior wear, such as HVAC blower motor issues and dashboard cracking, are also points to consider. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential weaknesses and factor in maintenance costs.
