The 2002 Dodge Neon was a compact car known for its relatively sporty handling and peppy performance, especially in the R/T trim. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0L SOHC inline-4 producing 132 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L DOHC inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 3-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the Neon's fuel economy and affordability, but common complaints revolved around its build quality, reliability issues, and somewhat noisy cabin.
