### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Dodge Neon is a budget-conscious choice that, while generally functional, exhibits some common reliability concerns. The powertrain, particularly the automatic transmission, can experience shifting issues, and engine components like seals and gaskets are prone to leaks. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also reported. Exterior paint and interior upholstery may show accelerated wear. While no single issue is overwhelmingly prevalent, a combination of these factors suggests that potential buyers should be prepared for moderate maintenance costs and potential repairs beyond routine servicing. Thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
