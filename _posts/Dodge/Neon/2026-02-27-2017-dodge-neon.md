### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Dodge Neon, while offering a range of engine and transmission choices, exhibits some common reliability concerns. The smaller E.torQ engines are more prone to oil and timing chain issues, whereas the 2.0L Tigershark appears more robust. The DDCT automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting and actuator problems, making the manual a potentially more reliable choice. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. The suspension, exterior, and interior generally hold up well, with only minor issues like climate control blower motor resistors being a recurring problem. Overall, careful maintenance and awareness of these specific potential issues are key for owners of the 2017 Neon.
