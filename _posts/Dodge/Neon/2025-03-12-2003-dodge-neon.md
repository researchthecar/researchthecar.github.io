The 2003 Dodge Neon was a compact car known for its sporty handling and relatively spacious interior for its class. While appreciated for its affordability and peppiness, it also had its share of drawbacks. Owners often lauded its fuel efficiency and ease of parking in urban environments. However, common complaints included build quality issues, frequent repairs, and a somewhat unrefined driving experience compared to competitors. The 2003 Neon came with a single engine option: a 2.0L SOHC 4-cylinder engine producing 132 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**2.0L SOHC 4-Cylinder**

*   **Cylinder Head Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine overheating, coolant loss with no visible leaks, white smoke from the exhaust, and potentially engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden engine stalling, inability to start, and potential internal engine damage if the valves collide with the pistons.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt and potentially repair any valve or piston damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ (more if internal damage occurred)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket, Oil Pan Gasket)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the engine, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket.
