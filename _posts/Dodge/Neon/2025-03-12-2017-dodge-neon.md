The 2017 Dodge Neon is a compact sedan primarily sold in the Mexican market, also known as the Fiat Tipo in other regions. It was offered with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing around 110 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Neon for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior, but some criticisms include the somewhat lackluster performance and basic interior features.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms can include the need to add oil every 1,000-2,000 miles, and blue smoke from the exhaust in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Regularly check and maintain proper oil levels. In cases of extreme consumption, a mechanic should inspect for leaks, piston ring issues, or valve seal problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil top-up) - $1500+ (engine repair/rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires causing rough idling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light illuminated. The OBDII code might indicate a specific cylinder misfiring.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors. Check for vacuum leaks as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6-speed automatic transmission can exhibit harsh or jerky shifting, especially during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Begin with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, a mechanic may need to diagnose and repair valve body issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front suspension bushings (specifically control arm bushings) can wear out faster than expected, leading to clunking noises over bumps and reduced handling precision.
    *   Solution: Replace worn bushings. In some cases, replacing the entire control arm assembly may be more cost-effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensor failures, which trigger the check engine light. Can also cause issues with fuel economy and engine performance.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Infotainment system may freeze, lag, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset, or seek software update from the dealer. In severe cases, replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/update) - $500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: AC blowing warm air, often due to refrigerant leaks or compressor failure.
    *   Solution: Recharge refrigerant after repairing leaks. Replace the compressor if it has failed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Dodge Neon, while generally reliable, can be subject to some common issues. Engine-related problems such as excessive oil consumption and misfires, along with harsh shifting from the automatic transmission, tend to be the most prevalent concerns. Suspension bushing wear and electrical gremlins in the infotainment system can also arise. While most of these problems are not catastrophic, they can lead to unexpected repair costs ranging from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars, depending on the severity of the issue. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
