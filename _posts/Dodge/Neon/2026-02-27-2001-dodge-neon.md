### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Dodge Neon can be a budget-friendly vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine reliability is a concern, particularly with head gasket failures and oil leaks, especially on the 2.0L variants. Both manual and automatic transmissions have their own sets of potential problems, ranging from clutch wear to torque converter issues. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module and power windows, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be an issue depending on climate, and interior components like HVAC blend doors and seat fabric may require attention. Overall, while not inherently unreliable, the Neon requires diligent maintenance and awareness of its common weak points to ensure continued serviceability.
