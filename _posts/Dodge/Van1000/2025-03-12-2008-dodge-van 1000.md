The 2008 Dodge Ram 1500 Van (also known as the Ram Cargo Van, and previously as the B-Series Van), while a workhorse appreciated for its spacious cargo area and relative simplicity, is also known for a few common problems as it ages. Available engine options included the 3.7L Magnum V6 producing around 215 hp and 235 lb-ft of torque, and the 5.7L Hemi V8 producing around 345 hp and 375 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the van's robust build and utility, but often report issues with rust, electrical problems, and some drivetrain components. Common complaints revolve around the cost of maintenance for older vehicles and some parts availability.
