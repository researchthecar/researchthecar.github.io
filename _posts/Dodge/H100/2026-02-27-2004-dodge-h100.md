### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Dodge H100 is a capable commercial vehicle, but its age means certain components are prone to wear and failure. The diesel engine, while generally robust, can suffer from glow plug and turbocharger issues. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, may require attention to clutch wear or fluid leaks. Suspension components like leaf springs can fatigue under heavy use. Electrical systems, particularly wiring harnesses and alternators, are common points of failure. Exterior rust is a significant concern depending on climate. Interior HVAC blower motors can also fail. Proactive maintenance and inspection of these areas are recommended for owners.
