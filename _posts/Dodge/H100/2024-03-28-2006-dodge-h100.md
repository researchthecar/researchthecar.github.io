* **Synchronizer failure:** The synchronizers can wear out or fail, causing the transmission to grind when shifting gears. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, a grinding noise, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the synchronizers. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $700.

**4-speed Automatic**

* **Transmission fluid leak:** The transmission fluid can leak from the transmission pan or other seals, causing the transmission to lose fluid and overheat. Symptoms include a leak under the transmission, a loss of transmission fluid, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the leaking seals or gaskets. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $700.
* **Solenoid failure:** The solenoids can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or not at all. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, a slipping transmission, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the failed solenoid. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400.

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension failure:** The front suspension components, such as the control arms, ball joints, and tie rods, can wear out or fail, causing the vehicle to pull to one side or the other, or to handle poorly. Symptoms include a pulling or drifting sensation, uneven tire wear, and a clunking or knocking noise from the front of the vehicle. The solution is to replace the failed suspension components. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000 per side.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the vehicle to lose electrical power. Symptoms include a loss of electrical power, a dimming or flickering of the headlights, and a check battery light. The solution is to replace the alternator. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $700.
