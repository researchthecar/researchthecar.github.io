Engine-specific problems range from minor ticking noises to more severe issues like sludge buildup and valve seat failures, varying significantly in cost. Transmission issues can be expensive to repair. Suspension problems related to ball joints and steering knuckles should be addressed promptly to prevent accidents. Electrical issues, while potentially annoying, are generally less severe.
