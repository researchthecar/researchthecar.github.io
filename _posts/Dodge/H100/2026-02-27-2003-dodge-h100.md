### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Dodge H100, particularly with its diesel engine options, is generally a workhorse vehicle. Common issues tend to revolve around components subject to high mileage and stress, such as suspension parts (leaf springs, ball joints), and wear items in the drivetrain like clutches and turbochargers. Electrical gremlins, often due to age and environmental exposure, can also surface. Rust is a significant concern, especially in certain climates. While not immune to problems, most issues are repairable and related to the vehicle's age and commercial application. Regular inspections and proactive maintenance can mitigate many of these potential reliability concerns.
