The 2003 Dodge H100, also known as the Hyundai Porter in some markets, is a cab-over-engine light truck primarily used for commercial purposes. It was offered with a 2.5-liter diesel engine producing around 78 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.4-liter gasoline engine producing around 118 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions are a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine and market. Owners appreciate its compact size and maneuverability, especially in urban environments, as well as its utility for hauling goods. Common dislikes include its relatively low power, basic interior, and ride quality, which is typical for a work truck.

**Summary**

The 2003 Dodge H100, being a work truck, is prone to issues related to wear and tear, particularly in the suspension and drivetrain. The 2.5L diesel engine tends to suffer from fuel injector and turbocharger problems, while the 2.4L gasoline engine is known for catalytic converter failures. Common transmission issues involve the clutch in the manual version, and harsh shifting with the automatic. Electrical problems due to wiring harness damage are also prevalent. Exterior rust and interior dashboard cracking are common cosmetic concerns. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, major issues such as turbocharger or catalytic converter replacement can become costly. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of wear, corrosion, and previous repairs, and budget accordingly for potential maintenance costs.
