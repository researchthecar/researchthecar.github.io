The 2014 Mini Cooper Paceman is a quirky and stylish subcompact crossover known for its distinctive design and sporty handling. Engine options included a 1.6-liter inline-4 producing 121 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque in the base model, and a turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 generating 181 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque in the S model. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Paceman's unique styling, nimble handling, and well-appointed interior. However, some common complaints include a firm ride, limited rear passenger space, and potentially higher maintenance costs compared to more mainstream vehicles.
