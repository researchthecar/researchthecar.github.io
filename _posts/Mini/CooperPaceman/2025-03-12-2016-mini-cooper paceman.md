The 2016 Mini Cooper Paceman is a quirky, sporty subcompact SUV known for its distinctive styling and fun driving dynamics. Engine options include a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing 121 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, a turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing 181 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque in the S model, and a more potent turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 producing 208 hp and 192 lb-ft in the John Cooper Works (JCW) variant. All trims are available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Paceman's agile handling and unique design, but some dislike the limited rear passenger space and firm ride.
