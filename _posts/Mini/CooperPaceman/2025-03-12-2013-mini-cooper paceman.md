The 2013 Mini Cooper Paceman is a quirky, sporty subcompact crossover coupe known for its distinctive styling and fun driving experience. It was available with a 1.6L inline-4 engine that produced 121 hp and 114 lb-ft of torque, or a turbocharged version of the same engine that produced 181 hp and 177 lb-ft of torque. A more potent John Cooper Works version of the turbo engine boosted performance to 215 hp and 207 lb-ft. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. Owners typically appreciate the Paceman's unique look, nimble handling, and well-appointed interior, but common complaints revolve around its limited rear passenger space, firm ride, and potential for costly repairs.
