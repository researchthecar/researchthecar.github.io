**2022 Mini Cooper Countryman**

The 2022 Mini Cooper Countryman is a subcompact crossover SUV that offers a unique blend of style, practicality, and performance. It is available with two engine options: a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine that produces 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. The three-cylinder engine is paired with a six-speed manual transmission or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, while the four-cylinder engine is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission.

Drivers appreciate the Countryman's fun-to-drive nature, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. However, it has also been criticized for its cramped back seat, limited cargo space, and lack of advanced safety features.
