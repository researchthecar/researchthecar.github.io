The 2012 Mini Cooper Countryman is a subcompact crossover known for its quirky styling, sporty handling, and available all-wheel drive. It came with several engine options. The base model featured a 1.6-liter inline-4 producing 121 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. The S model was equipped with a turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 generating 181 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally like the Countryman's unique character, agile handling, and fuel efficiency (especially with the base engine). Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space, a firm ride, and potentially high repair costs.

**Summary**

The 2012 Mini Cooper Countryman, particularly the S model with the turbocharged engine, can present owners with several potential issues. Engine problems, especially related to the timing chain and HPFP, can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission is also prone to issues.
