The 2015 Mini Cooper Countryman offers a blend of Mini's iconic styling and hatchback practicality with available all-wheel drive. It's generally praised for its unique design, nimble handling (especially for its size), and customizable options. However, some owners find the ride a bit stiff, the rear seats somewhat cramped, and the fuel economy not as stellar as expected. Engine options include a 1.6L inline-4 producing 121 hp and 114 lb-ft of torque, a turbocharged 1.6L inline-4 producing 181 hp and 177 lb-ft of torque (S model), and a more powerful turbocharged 1.6L inline-4 producing 208 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque (JCW model). Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic.
