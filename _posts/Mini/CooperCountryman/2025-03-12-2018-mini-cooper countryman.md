The 2018 Mini Cooper Countryman is a subcompact crossover SUV that offers a blend of Mini's iconic styling and practicality. The standard engine is a 1.5L turbocharged three-cylinder producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. A 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine is also available, delivering 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque in the Cooper S and 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft in the John Cooper Works variant. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and an 8-speed automatic, depending on the engine.
