The 2023 Mini Cooper Countryman is a quirky and fun subcompact SUV that offers a unique blend of style and practicality. The standard engine is a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine is also available, delivering 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque in the Cooper S Countryman and 301 horsepower and 331 lb-ft in the John Cooper Works Countryman. Transmission options include a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic and an 8-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level.
