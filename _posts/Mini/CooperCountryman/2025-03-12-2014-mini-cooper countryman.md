The 2014 Mini Cooper Countryman is a subcompact crossover known for its distinctive styling and fun driving dynamics. Engine options included a 1.6-liter inline-4 producing 121 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque in the base model, a turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 producing 181 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque in the S model, and a higher-output turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 producing 208 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque in the JCW model. Transmission options consist of a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Countryman's unique design, agile handling, and available all-wheel drive. Common dislikes include the firm ride, cramped rear seating (relative to other crossovers), and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**1.6L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4 (Base Model)**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the thermostat housing or water pump. This can lead to overheating and engine damage. Visible coolant puddles may be present under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty thermostat housing or water pump and any damaged hoses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4 (S and JCW Models)**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. Potential for engine misfires and eventual engine failure if the timing chain breaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, hesitation during acceleration, reduced fuel economy, and potential engine misfires. The direct injection system on the turbocharged engines does not wash the intake valves with fuel, leading to carbon deposits.
    *   Solution: Perform an intake valve cleaning service (e.g., walnut blasting).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Long crank times, engine misfires, stalling, and potential for the engine to not start.
    *   Solution: Replace the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, especially between certain gears. The transmission may slip out of gear or hesitate during acceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement can resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven for a few days. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair parasitic draws in the electrical system. Common causes include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (diagnosis and repair)
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Power Window Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working intermittently or completely.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator or motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may leak, get stuck, or make excessive noise during operation.
    *   Solution: Clean and lubricate sunroof tracks. In some cases, the sunroof motor or mechanism may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattles and Squeaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various rattles and squeaks emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear hatch area.
    *   Solution: Tighten loose trim pieces, add insulation to reduce noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Difficult to estimate, depends on the severity and location of the noise.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Mini Cooper Countryman has some notable issues to be aware of, particularly with the turbocharged engines and automatic transmissions. Timing chain issues and carbon buildup are significant concerns for the turbocharged models, potentially leading to costly repairs. Electrical problems and sunroof malfunctions can also be troublesome. While some issues may be relatively minor, others can be expensive to fix.
