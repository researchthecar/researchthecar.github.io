The 2017 Mini Cooper Countryman is a subcompact crossover known for its quirky styling, fun-to-drive nature, and surprisingly spacious interior. Engine options include a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine making 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, and a plug-in hybrid powertrain combining the 1.5-liter engine with an electric motor for a total output of 221 horsepower. Transmission choices include a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and an 8-speed automatic, depending on the engine. Owners often praise the Countryman's distinctive design, agile handling, and premium feel. However, some criticisms include its relatively small cargo area, firm ride, and potential for higher repair costs compared to other subcompact crossovers.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Three-Cylinder Engine**
*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can develop from various points in the cooling system including hoses, the water pump, or the coolant reservoir. The most obvious sign is a low coolant level and the presence of coolant on the ground. Overheating can also occur.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty component. This could involve replacing hoses, the water pump, or the coolant reservoir.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $700+ depending on the component that failed.

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder Engine**
*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to rough running, a check engine light, and potential engine damage if not addressed promptly. Rattling noises from the engine, particularly on startup, can be an early warning sign.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2000+

**Electric Motor**
*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**
*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly when cold. The transmission may hesitate or feel clunky when changing gears.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve the issue. In other cases, a transmission flush and filter change or valve body replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission**
*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a delay when shifting into drive or reverse. This delay can be accompanied by a clunking noise.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the problem. If not, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4000+

**Suspension**
*No Issues Found*

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators can fail, causing the doors to not lock or unlock properly, or to lock/unlock randomly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per door.
*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery can drain prematurely, especially if the car is left unused for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This could involve replacing a faulty module or component. Also, ensure the battery is in good condition and properly charged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the sunroof, including leaks, failure to open or close properly, or excessive noise during operation.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the sunroof mechanism. This may involve cleaning and lubricating the tracks, replacing seals, or replacing the entire sunroof assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+

**Interior**

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty connecting to Bluetooth, dropped connections, and distorted audio during calls are common complaints.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates for the infotainment system. If the problem persists, try resetting the Bluetooth module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0-$300+

**Summary:** The 2017 Mini Cooper Countryman has a mix of minor and potentially more serious issues. Coolant Leaks and Door Lock Actuators are a few minor issues. Timing chain issues, rough shifting in the 6-speed automatic transmission and delayed engagement in the 8-speed automatic transmission can become costly.
