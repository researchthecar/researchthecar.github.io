The 2013 Mini Cooper Countryman is a subcompact crossover known for its distinctive styling and sporty handling. It was offered with several engine options. The base model features a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing 121 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. The Cooper S Countryman boasts a turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4, delivering 181 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. A JCW model also used a turbocharged 1.6L motor making 208 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Countryman's unique design, nimble handling, and available all-wheel drive, but often dislike its relatively high price, firm ride, and somewhat cramped rear seating.
