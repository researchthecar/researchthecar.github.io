The 2016 Mini Cooper Countryman is a subcompact SUV that offers a unique blend of style and practicality. It was available with several engine options, including a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder (134 hp, 162 lb-ft of torque), a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (121 hp, 114 lb-ft of torque, 181 hp, 177 lb-ft of torque or 208 hp, 192 lb-ft of torque depending on the trim), and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (189 hp, 207 lb-ft of torque), each paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission (some models also offered an 8-speed automatic). Drivers often appreciate the Countryman's distinctive design and agile handling. Conversely, some common complaints revolve around the relatively firm ride, smaller cargo space compared to other subcompact SUVs, and potential reliability concerns.
