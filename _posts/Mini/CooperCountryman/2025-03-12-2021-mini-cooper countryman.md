The 2021 Mini Cooper Countryman is a subcompact SUV that offers a blend of Mini's iconic styling and driving dynamics with added practicality. This model year came with several engine options, including a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque (in the Cooper S Countryman), and a plug-in hybrid variant combining the 1.5-liter engine with an electric motor for a combined output of 221 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque. A higher-performance John Cooper Works version with a more powerful 2.0-liter engine (301 hp and 331 lb-ft of torque) was also available. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, 7-speed dual-clutch, and 8-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim. Owners often appreciate the Countryman's distinctive design, agile handling, and premium interior, while some criticisms focus on its relatively small cargo space, firm ride, and higher price compared to other subcompact SUVs.

**Electric Motor**

**Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV)**
* **Reduced Electric Range Over Time**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a noticeable decrease in the all-electric range of their plug-in hybrid Countryman over time. This can be attributed to battery degradation, a common occurrence in electric vehicles. The vehicle may switch to gasoline power sooner than expected.
    * Solution: Diagnostics at a Mini dealership to assess battery health and determine if a battery module replacement is needed. Software updates may also improve battery management.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix:
    * Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged 3-Cylinder**
*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are reported, often stemming from the coolant reservoir or hoses connected to the turbocharger. This can lead to overheating if not addressed. Symptoms include low coolant levels, visible leaks under the car, and a coolant warning light.
    *   Solution: Identify and replace the leaking component (reservoir, hose, or connection). Pressure test the cooling system to confirm the leak is resolved.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket or the timing chain cover are occasionally reported. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket or reseal the timing chain cover. Clean any residual oil from the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed rough or jerky shifting, especially at lower speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. This can manifest as hesitation or lurching during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) may alleviate some issues. In more severe cases, clutch replacement or valve body repair may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for software, $2000+ for clutch replacement or valve body repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may require restarting the system or, in some cases, the entire car.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Mini can address many of these issues. Check for updates and install them via the dealership or over-the-air if available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue), $100+ for diagnosis if further repair is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Mini Cooper Countryman, while generally reliable, can experience a range of issues, from minor electrical glitches to more significant engine and transmission problems. The plug-in hybrid variant may face battery degradation over time. Engine issues such as coolant and oil leaks are relatively common and can lead to more serious problems if left unaddressed. Transmission issues, especially with the dual-clutch transmission, can affect driving experience. Interior rattles and sunroof malfunctions can also be frustrating. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely, with some being easily resolved with software updates or minor repairs, while others may require more extensive and costly fixes.
