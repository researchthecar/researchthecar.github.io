The 2019 Mini Cooper Countryman is a subcompact crossover known for its quirky styling, agile handling, and premium feel. Engine options include a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, and a plug-in hybrid variant combining the three-cylinder engine with an electric motor. The 2.0-liter engine produces around 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Countryman's fun-to-drive nature and distinctive design, but some dislike its higher price point compared to competitors and potential reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Three-Cylinder**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points within the cooling system, but specifically the coolant reservoir. These leaks often manifest as a noticeable coolant smell, visible puddles of coolant under the vehicle, and potential overheating issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves pressure testing the cooling system to pinpoint the source of the leak. Replacement of the affected component, such as the reservoir, is then required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks emanating from the oil filter housing. These leaks can drip onto exhaust components, creating a burning oil smell and potentially leading to low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing, including new gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises from the engine, especially upon startup. This can indicate wear or stretching of the timing chain, potentially leading to more serious engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Plug-In Hybrid (1.5L Turbo + Electric Motor)**

*   **High Voltage Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced electric range, failure to charge properly, or error messages related to the high voltage battery system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician to determine the cause of the battery issue. In some cases, individual modules within the battery pack may be replaced. In more severe cases, the entire battery pack may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts between gears, hesitation when accelerating, or delayed engagement of gears. This can be more pronounced at lower speeds or during cold weather.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may alleviate the issue. However, more serious cases may require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks emanating from the transmission area, visible puddles of oil under the vehicle, and potentially rough shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transmission pan gasket, seals, or other components causing the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Noises from Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking, creaking, or squeaking noises coming from the suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. Common culprits include worn sway bar links, control arm bushings, or strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Inspection of suspension components to identify the source of the noise. Replacement of the affected parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component replaced
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of suspension bushings, particularly in the control arms and sway bar links. This can lead to loose handling, increased noise, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn bushings or entire control arms/sway bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per component replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or unresponsive behavior of the infotainment system. Software glitches, screen malfunctions, or connectivity problems can also occur.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system resets, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (TPMS, ABS, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction of various sensors, such as tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensors or anti-lock braking system (ABS) sensors. This can trigger warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor.
