The 2020 Mini Cooper Countryman is a subcompact crossover known for its quirky styling, agile handling, and available all-wheel drive. Engine options include a 1.5L turbocharged three-cylinder (134 hp, 162 lb-ft), a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (189 hp, 207 lb-ft) and a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder John Cooper Works engine (301 hp, 331 lb-ft). A plug-in hybrid version is also available, combining the 1.5L engine with an electric motor. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, 7-speed dual-clutch automatic, and an 8-speed automatic, depending on the engine. Owners appreciate the Countryman's unique design, fun-to-drive nature, and relatively spacious interior compared to other Minis. Common dislikes include the higher price point, sometimes firm ride, and less than stellar fuel economy in some configurations.
