The 2011 Mini Cooper Countryman marked the brand's foray into the subcompact crossover SUV market. It offered a blend of Mini's iconic styling and increased practicality. Engine options included a 1.6-liter inline-4 producing 121 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque in the base model, and a turbocharged version of the same engine generating 181 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque in the S model. Both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive (ALL4) configurations were available. Transmission choices included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Countryman's distinctive design, nimble handling, and available all-wheel drive. Common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the engine and electrical systems, as well as a somewhat firm ride.
