The 2021 Mini Cooper Clubman is a unique offering, combining Mini's iconic styling with a more practical wagon body style. The base model features a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A more powerful option is the Cooper S Clubman with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, available with a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. The high-performance John Cooper Works Clubman boasts a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder pushing out 301 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque, coupled with an 8-speed automatic transmission and ALL4 all-wheel drive. Owners often praise the Clubman's distinctive design, agile handling, and premium interior. However, some criticisms include a firm ride, limited rear passenger space (compared to other wagons), and a higher price point than some competitors.

The 2021 Mini Cooper Clubman, while generally reliable, has some potential issues to be aware of. The John Cooper Works model seems more prone to excessive oil consumption. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission in the base and Cooper S models has been reported to have rough shifting. Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system and random warning lights, are also potential concerns. Interior rattles can be an annoyance.
