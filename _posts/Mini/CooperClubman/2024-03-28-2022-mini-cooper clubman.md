**Introduction**

The 2022 Mini Cooper Clubman is a compact station wagon that slots above the standard Mini Cooper in terms of size and practicality. Motivated by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, the Cooper Clubman offers a spirited driving experience. Transmission choices include a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. The Mini Cooper Clubman is praised for its quirky styling, premium interior, and fun-to-drive nature. However, it is criticized for its limited rear seat space and firm ride.
