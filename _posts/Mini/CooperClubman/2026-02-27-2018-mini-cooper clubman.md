### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mini Cooper Clubman demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its 1.5L engine and the 8-speed automatic transmission, which show minimal reported issues. The more powerful 2.0L turbo engine in the Cooper S variants has a higher likelihood of encountering turbocharger or cooling system problems, though these are not universally reported. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and occasional battery drain, are the most common non-powertrain concerns. While the manual transmission can experience clutch wear, this is often related to driving style. For the most part, the Clubman offers a dependable ownership experience, with most potential issues being manageable and repairable.
