The 2020 Mini Cooper Clubman is a stylish and practical small wagon offering a unique blend of fun-to-drive character and everyday usability. Engine options include a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, and a John Cooper Works version of the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 301 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic, and an 8-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners often praise the Clubman for its distinctive design, nimble handling, and premium feel. Criticisms frequently focus on its relatively small rear seats, limited cargo space compared to other wagons, and potentially higher repair costs.
