The 2023 Mini Cooper Clubman is a stylish and practical compact wagon offering a unique blend of fun-to-drive handling and increased cargo space compared to the standard Mini Cooper. Engine options include a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, and a John Cooper Works (JCW) version of the 2.0-liter engine producing 301 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque. All engines are available with either a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission or an 8-speed automatic transmission, depending on the trim level. Owners often praise the Clubman for its distinctive design, agile handling, and premium interior, while some criticisms include its relatively high price point and limited rear passenger space compared to other compact wagons.
