The 2018 Mini Cooper Clubman is a stylish and practical compact wagon, offering a unique blend of fun driving dynamics and increased cargo space compared to the standard Mini Cooper. Engine options include a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder generating 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque (in the Cooper S), and a higher-performance 2.0-liter turbo four making 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque in the John Cooper Works model. Transmission choices are a 6-speed manual, 6-speed automatic (with the 1.5L), or an 8-speed automatic (with the 2.0L). Owners often praise the Clubman's distinctive design, agile handling, and premium interior, but some common dislikes include its relatively small back seat and potential for higher running costs.
