The 2016 Mini Cooper Clubman is a unique compact car known for its quirky styling and fun-to-drive nature. Engine options include a 1.5L turbocharged three-cylinder (134 hp, 162 lb-ft of torque), a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (189 hp, 207 lb-ft of torque), and a more powerful 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder in the John Cooper Works model (228 hp, 258 lb-ft of torque). Transmission choices consist of a 6-speed manual (depending on the engine configuration) and a 6-speed or 8-speed automatic. People often praise the Clubman for its agile handling, distinctive design, and relatively spacious cargo area compared to other MINIs. Common criticisms include its higher price point compared to other compact cars and the potential for costly repairs.
