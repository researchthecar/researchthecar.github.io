The 2019 Mini Cooper Clubman is a stylish and practical small wagon known for its fun-to-drive nature and unique design. The base model comes with a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque in the Cooper S model, and a more powerful version of the same 2.0-liter engine producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque in the John Cooper Works (JCW) model. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, 6-speed automatic (available on the base model), an 8-speed automatic (available on the S and JCW models) and a 7-speed dual clutch transmission. Owners often praise the Clubman's distinctive styling, agile handling, and premium interior. However, some common complaints include a firm ride, limited rear passenger space (compared to other wagons), and a higher price point than some competitors.
