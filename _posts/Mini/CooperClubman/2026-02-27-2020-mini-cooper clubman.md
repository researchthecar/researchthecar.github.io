### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Mini Cooper Clubman offers a generally reliable ownership experience, especially with the 8-speed automatic transmission. The 1.5L and 2.0L turbocharged engines, while generally robust, have occasional reports of coolant leaks, turbocharger issues, and oil leaks, respectively. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are the most frequently cited non-routine issues. Suspension, exterior, and interior components show a high degree of reliability with no widespread problems reported. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of leaks or shifting anomalies are recommended for optimal long-term performance.
