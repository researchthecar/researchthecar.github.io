The 2017 Mini Cooper Clubman is a unique compact car that blends hatchback practicality with MINI's signature quirky styling and fun driving dynamics. For the 2017 model year, the Clubman offered three engine options: a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder (134 hp, 162 lb-ft of torque), a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (189 hp, 207 lb-ft of torque), and a more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder in the John Cooper Works (JCW) trim (228 hp, 258 lb-ft of torque). Transmission choices varied depending on the engine and trim, including 6-speed manual, 6-speed automatic, and 8-speed automatic options. Owners often praise the Clubman for its distinctive design, agile handling, and premium interior. Common complaints often revolve around its relatively small cargo space, limited rear passenger room, and potentially higher running costs compared to more mainstream compact cars.

**Summary**

The 2017 Mini Cooper Clubman, while generally a reliable and fun-to-drive vehicle, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly oil leaks and timing chain concerns on the 2.0L, and transmission problems, such as rough shifting in both automatic options, can be costly to repair. Electrical problems like battery drain and faulty TPMS sensors can also be frustrating. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like timing chain replacement or transmission overhaul, can be significant. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
