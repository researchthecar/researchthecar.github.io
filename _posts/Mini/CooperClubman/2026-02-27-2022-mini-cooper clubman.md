### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Mini Cooper Clubman demonstrates good overall reliability, with most reported issues being minor and addressable through software updates or component replacements. The 2.0L turbocharged engine, while offering spirited performance, has a slightly higher potential for issues like coolant leaks and turbocharger problems compared to the 1.5L three-cylinder. Transmission reliability is generally strong across all options, though some dual-clutch automatic users have reported occasional shifting anomalies. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are not uncommon but are typically resolved with software fixes. For owners prioritizing a blend of driving dynamics and dependable daily use, the Clubman is a solid choice, especially models equipped with the 1.5L engine or manual transmission.
