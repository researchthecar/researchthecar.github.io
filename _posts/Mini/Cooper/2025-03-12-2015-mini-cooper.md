The 2015 Mini Cooper is a popular subcompact car known for its sporty handling and quirky design. Engine options include a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder (134 hp, 162 lb-ft of torque), a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (189 hp, 207 lb-ft of torque in the Cooper S), and a more powerful 2.0-liter turbo four (228 hp, 236 lb-ft of torque in the John Cooper Works version). Both a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic transmission were available. Owners often praise the Mini's fun-to-drive nature and distinctive styling but sometimes complain about the firm ride and limited rear passenger space.
