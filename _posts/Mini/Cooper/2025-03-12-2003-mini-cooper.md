The 2003 Mini Cooper, the first of the "new" Minis under BMW ownership, is a quirky and fun-to-drive small car. It was offered with a 1.6L inline-4 engine, available in naturally aspirated (around 115 hp and 110 lb-ft of torque) and supercharged (around 163 hp and 155 lb-ft of torque) variants. Transmissions included a 5-speed manual and an automatic. People love the Mini's distinctive styling, nimble handling, and fuel efficiency. Common complaints center around reliability issues, particularly with the earlier models, and higher than average maintenance costs.

**Summary**

The 2003 Mini Cooper is a fun car but owners face a higher than average risk of potential maintenance and repair. Engine issues (coolant/oil leaks, supercharger failure), transmission problems (especially with the automatic), and electrical gremlins can be costly to address. Rust is also a concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to major repairs exceeding several thousand dollars. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended.
