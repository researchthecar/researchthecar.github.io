The 2007 Mini Cooper is a fun and stylish subcompact car known for its nimble handling and distinctive design. Engine options included a 1.6L inline-4 naturally aspirated engine producing 118 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, and a supercharged version of the same engine in the Cooper S producing 172 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Both were available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car's engaging driving experience and unique styling, but common complaints include reliability issues and relatively high maintenance costs.

**Summary**

The 2007 Mini Cooper, while enjoyable to drive, suffers from a number of reliability issues, particularly with the engine (oil leaks, supercharger issues on the S model), transmission, and electrical system. Suspension components also tend to wear out. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for more significant problems like engine or transmission work. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential expenses when considering a used 2007 Mini Cooper.
