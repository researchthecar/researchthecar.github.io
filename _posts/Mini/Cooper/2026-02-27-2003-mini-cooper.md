### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mini Cooper is a fun and stylish car, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engines, particularly the supercharged variant, can experience belt and clutch problems. Transmissions, especially the CVT, are a known weak point and can be costly to repair. Suspension components like bushings and mounts are prone to wear, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or window regulators, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern on older models, and interior wear on seats is common. Despite these potential issues, regular maintenance and addressing problems promptly can help maintain the Mini Cooper's charm and driving pleasure.
