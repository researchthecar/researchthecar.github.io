The 2002 Mini Cooper, the first of the "new" BMW-era MINIs, is a distinctive and fun-to-drive hatchback. Its 1.6-liter inline-4 engine produced around 115 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque in its base form, while the supercharged Cooper S variant (not covered here) offered significantly more power. The base model came with a 5-speed manual or an optional automatic transmission. Owners often praise its go-kart-like handling, unique styling, and fuel efficiency. Common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with certain components failing prematurely, and the relatively firm ride.
