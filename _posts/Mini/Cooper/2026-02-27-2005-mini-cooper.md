### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mini Cooper is a fun car to drive, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engines, particularly the naturally aspirated and supercharged 1.6L variants, can experience oil and coolant leaks. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, may require clutch replacements or can develop fluid leak issues. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shock mounts are also known to wear. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module or window regulators, can be frustrating. Exterior rust and interior wear, especially on seats and HVAC blowers, are also points to inspect. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most frequent non-maintenance related repairs.
