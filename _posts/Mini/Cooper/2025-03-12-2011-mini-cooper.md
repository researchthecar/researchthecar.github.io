The 2011 Mini Cooper is a popular subcompact car known for its sporty handling, distinctive styling, and fuel efficiency. It was available in several trims including the base Cooper, Cooper S, and John Cooper Works (JCW), each offering a different level of performance. The base Cooper features a 1.6-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 engine producing around 121 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. The Cooper S boasts a turbocharged version of the same engine, generating approximately 181 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. The JCW takes it a step further with a tuned version of the turbo engine, delivering around 208 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque. All trims were offered with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Mini's nimble handling and unique design, but common complaints include reliability issues and higher maintenance costs compared to other small cars.

**Engine**

**1.6L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4 (Base Cooper)**
*   **Thermostat Housing Leaks**
