**Introduction:**

The 2021 Mini Cooper is a small, sporty hatchback available with a choice of three- or four-cylinder engines and either a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The Cooper S model boasts a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, while the top-of-the-line John Cooper Works model cranks out 228 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque from its turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The Mini Cooper is known for its agile handling, premium interior, and customizable options, but it has also been criticized for its firm ride quality and limited rear-seat space.
