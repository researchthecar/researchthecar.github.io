The 2006 Mini Cooper is a stylish and fun-to-drive subcompact car known for its distinctive design and agile handling. The base model features a 1.6L inline-4 engine producing 115 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. A supercharged variant of the same engine, found in the Cooper S, boosts output to 168 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual (Cooper S), and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Mini's go-kart-like handling, fuel efficiency, and unique retro styling. However, common complaints include higher-than-average maintenance costs, a firm ride, and limited rear passenger space.

**Summary**

The 2006 Mini Cooper, while enjoyable to drive, can present owners with a range of potential issues. Engine issues, particularly coolant and oil leaks, are common across both engine options. The Cooper S, with its supercharged engine, faces additional concerns regarding supercharger reliability. The automatic transmission may experience valve body problems, leading to shifting difficulties. Suspension components, like strut mounts and control arm bushings, are prone to wear, affecting handling and ride quality. Electrical issues, such as power window malfunctions and central locking problems, can also occur. Rust is a potential concern, especially in regions with harsh weather. Headliner sagging is a common interior problem. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs compared to other vehicles in its class.
