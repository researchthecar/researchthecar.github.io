The 2004 Mini Cooper is a fun and stylish subcompact car known for its nimble handling and distinctive retro design. Engine options include a 1.6L inline-4 cylinder engine available in naturally aspirated and supercharged configurations. The base model produces 115 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. The Cooper S, with its supercharger, bumps that up to 163 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a CVT for the base model, and a 6-speed manual for the Cooper S. The Mini Cooper is praised for its go-kart-like handling and unique styling but is often criticized for its reliability issues and somewhat cramped rear seats.

**Engine**

**1.6L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various locations, including the thermostat housing, water pump, and radiator hoses. Common symptoms include a low coolant warning light, visible coolant leaks under the car, and engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking component (thermostat housing, water pump, hoses, etc.). Pressure testing the cooling system can help pinpoint the source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, especially from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and crankshaft seals. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Clean the affected area to ensure proper sealing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crank Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall or fail to start, often accompanied by a check engine light. Diagnostic codes related to the crank position sensor may be present.
