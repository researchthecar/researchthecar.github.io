The 2021 Mini Cooper is a stylish and fun-to-drive subcompact car known for its agile handling and distinctive retro design. Available in both two-door and four-door (Hardtop and Convertible) body styles, the 2021 model year offers a range of engine options: a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque (Cooper S), and a more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder boasting 228 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque (John Cooper Works). All engines come standard with a six-speed manual transmission or optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Drivers love the Mini's sporty feel, nimble handling, and unique styling.
