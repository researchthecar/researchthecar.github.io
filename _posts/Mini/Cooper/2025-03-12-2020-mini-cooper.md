The 2020 Mini Cooper is a stylish and fun-to-drive subcompact car known for its nimble handling and distinctive design. It's available with several engine options, including a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful version of the 2.0-liter turbo-four producing 228 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque in the John Cooper Works trim. A 6-speed manual transmission is available on certain models, as is a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic or an 8-speed automatic. Drivers often praise the Mini's sharp steering, responsive engines, and unique interior design. However, some common complaints include a stiff ride, limited rear passenger space, and a relatively high price tag.
