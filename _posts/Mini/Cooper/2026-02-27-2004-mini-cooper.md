### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mini Cooper offers an engaging driving experience but requires attention to potential reliability issues. Common concerns include oil and coolant leaks from the engine, clutch wear and transmission issues (especially with the CVT), and worn suspension components like bushings and ball joints. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulator failures and ABS module problems, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the heater blower motor may require replacement. While not inherently unreliable, owners should be prepared for maintenance beyond routine servicing, particularly as the vehicle ages. Regular inspections and addressing minor issues promptly can help mitigate more significant and costly repairs.
