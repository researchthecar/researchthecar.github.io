The 2017 Mini Cooper is a stylish and fun-to-drive subcompact car known for its nimble handling and distinctive design. Available in various trims and body styles (including the Hardtop 2 Door, Hardtop 4 Door, Convertible, and Clubman), it offers a range of engine options. A popular choice is the 1.5L turbocharged three-cylinder engine, producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder in various states of tune, found in the Cooper S and John Cooper Works models. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim. Owners often praise the Mini Cooper's unique styling, engaging driving dynamics, and premium feel.
