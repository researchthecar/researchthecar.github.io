**2008 Mini Cooper**

The 2008 Mini Cooper is a subcompact car known for its sporty handling and stylish design. It comes standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine (N12) that produces 118 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. An optional S variant comes with a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (N14) producing 172 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, mated to a six-speed manual or automatic transmission.
