The 2024 Mini Cooper, a subcompact car known for its iconic design and agile handling, comes in a few configurations. The standard Cooper is powered by a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine producing 134 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful Cooper S version is available, featuring a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 189 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. The high-performance John Cooper Works (JCW) model boasts an even more potent version of the 2.0-liter engine, generating 228 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. All models can be had with a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, but the JCW comes standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Mini Cooper's distinctive styling, sporty driving dynamics, and premium interior. However, some criticisms include its small rear seats, limited cargo space, and relatively firm ride.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric**

*   **Reduced Range in Cold Weather**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Electric vehicle range is significantly reduced in cold temperatures due to battery inefficiency and increased energy consumption for cabin heating.
    *   Solution: Precondition the battery and cabin while plugged in, use seat heaters instead of cabin heat when possible, and drive conservatively. Software updates may improve battery management.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (behavioral adjustments and software updates potentially free)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Degradation Over Time**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual reduction in battery capacity and range as the vehicle ages and accumulates mileage.
    *   Solution: Monitor battery health through the vehicle's information system, follow recommended charging practices (avoiding frequent full charges and discharges), and consider battery replacement when capacity becomes significantly diminished.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement costs can range from $8,000 - $20,000 depending on battery size and supplier.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central infotainment screen may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates and install them if available. If the problem persists, a dealer visit may be necessary to diagnose and potentially replace the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free; infotainment unit replacement can range from $500 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Connectivity Issues (Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty connecting to Bluetooth devices, intermittent disconnections, or failures in Apple CarPlay or Android Auto integration.
    *   Solution: Ensure the phone's operating system is up to date, check the car's infotainment system for updates, and try unpairing and repairing the devices. If the problem persists, it could be a hardware issue with the car's connectivity module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis and software updates might be free; hardware repair can range from $200 - $800+.
