### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mini Cooper is a fun and stylish car, but its age means certain components are prone to failure. Common issues include oil and coolant leaks from the engine, clutch wear on manual transmissions, and potential failures in the CVT automatic. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module and window regulators, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. While suspension components like control arm bushings can wear, they are generally less problematic than the powertrain or electrical systems. Regular maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly are key to maintaining the reliability of these charming vehicles.
