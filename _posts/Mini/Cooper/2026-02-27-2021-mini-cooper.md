### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Mini Cooper demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its base 1.5L engine and manual transmission. The more potent 2.0L engine found in Cooper S and JCW models shows a propensity for minor coolant leaks and potential turbocharger issues, which are not uncommon for turbocharged performance engines. The dual-clutch automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. However, these issues are generally manageable and do not indicate systemic failures across the model range. For owners prioritizing reliability, the manual transmission and standard engine offer a more robust experience, while the performance variants may require slightly more attention to potential issues.
