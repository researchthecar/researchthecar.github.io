**Summary**

The 2014 Mini Cooper can experience a range of issues, with the most common problems relating to the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Engine issues, particularly coolant and oil leaks in the 1.5L engine, and timing chain and HPFP problems in the 2.0L engine, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as rough shifting, can also require significant expense. Electrical problems like faulty window regulators and battery drains are also common.
