### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Bentley Continental is a complex luxury vehicle where reliability is generally good for its class, but specific areas require attention. The powertrain, particularly the engine's turbochargers and the transmission's control module, can be sources of significant repair costs. The adaptive air suspension is another area prone to issues like leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or infotainment system, are also noted. While the exterior and interior materials are typically durable, climate control actuators can fail. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for mitigating these potential problems and preserving the vehicle's performance and luxury.
