The 2003 Bentley Continental GT marked a significant shift for the brand, offering a blend of luxury and performance. It was initially available with a single powertrain option: a 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged W12 engine producing 552 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a ZF 6HP26 six-speed automatic transmission. People generally love the Continental GT for its luxurious interior, powerful engine, and opulent presence. However, common dislikes include its complex systems, potential for high maintenance costs, and considerable weight.

**Engine**

**6.0L Twin-Turbocharged W12**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks often originate from the plastic coolant pipes and hoses, leading to overheating and potential engine damage. The leaks may be visible under the car or noticeable by a drop in coolant level.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the plastic coolant pipes with upgraded aluminum or silicone hoses. Replacing leaking hoses as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and loss of power. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to misfires on specific cylinders may be present. This is a common issue on W12 engines due to the large number of coil packs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty coil packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on how many need to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, whistling noises from the engine bay, and potentially excessive oil consumption. May also trigger error codes related to turbocharger performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuilding of the turbochargers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ (depending on if one or both turbochargers need to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 6HP26 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, and potentially going into "limp mode." Can trigger transmission-related DTCs.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially during lockup, and potential stalling. Can also generate unusual noises from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car sits low, especially on one side, and may take a long time to lift. Error messages related to the air suspension system are common. The compressor itself may be noisy or inoperative.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to compressor failure, the car may sit low. Hissing sounds can sometimes be heard from the leaking strut.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car sits for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting or a completely dead battery. There are many modules that can cause this issue and require extensive diagnosis.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the drain (often a faulty module or relay) and repair or replacement of the component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system fails to function, the screen freezes or blacks out, or the audio system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Software updates or replacement of the infotainment system components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and component requiring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture builds up inside the headlight lenses, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the headlight components.
    *   Solution: Resealing the headlight lenses or replacing the entire headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Parking Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The parking sensors become erratic or stop working altogether. Error messages related to the parking sensor system may appear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty parking sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation Screen Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The protective film on the navigation screen starts to peel or bubble, making the screen difficult to see.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the navigation screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows operate slowly, erratically, or not at all. Unusual noises may be heard when attempting to operate the windows.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per window

**Summary**

The 2003 Bentley Continental GT, while a luxury icon, is prone to a range of issues that can result in high maintenance costs. Engine problems such as coolant leaks and coil pack failures, coupled with transmission issues like valve body failure, are prevalent. Suspension and electrical system problems can also lead to significant expenses. Owners should be prepared for potentially costly repairs.
