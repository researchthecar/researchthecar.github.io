### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Bentley Continental, while a magnificent vehicle, requires diligent maintenance due to its complex engineering. The engine and transmission are generally robust but can present costly issues like turbocharger problems and automatic transmission wear. The hydropneumatic suspension, a hallmark of its luxury, can be a source of expensive hydraulic leaks and component failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and central locking, are also noted. Exterior and interior components, while luxurious, are typically durable if well-maintained. Prospective owners should budget for specialized servicing and potential repairs, as parts and labor for a Bentley are premium.
