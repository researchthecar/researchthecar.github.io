**Summary**

The 2018 Bentley Continental GT, while a luxurious and high-performing vehicle, does have some common issues owners may encounter. Engine oil and coolant leaks, turbocharger failures (particularly on the V8), air suspension problems, and electrical gremlins (especially with the infotainment system) appear most frequently. The severity and cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for more extensive repairs, making a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Bentley technician highly recommended. While the majority of these issues are not necessarily widespread enough to be considered inherent flaws, they are worth noting for potential buyers.
