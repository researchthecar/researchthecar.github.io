### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Bentley Continental GT, while a magnificent vehicle, exhibits reliability characteristics typical of high-performance, complex luxury cars. The W12 engine, though powerful, can be prone to issues with its turbochargers and ignition system, and coolant leaks are not uncommon. The ZF automatic transmission, while generally robust, can suffer from torque converter or mechatronic unit failures. The adaptive air suspension is a common source of concern, with leaks in air springs and compressor failures being notable. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and door locks, can also arise. Exterior and interior components, such as headlight seals and power seat motors, can also require attention. Owners should budget for potentially significant repair costs, especially for powertrain and suspension components, and ensure diligent maintenance by specialists.
