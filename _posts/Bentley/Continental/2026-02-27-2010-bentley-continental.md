### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Bentley Continental GT is a highly capable luxury vehicle with a generally strong reliability record for its class. However, its complexity means that specific components, particularly in the powertrain (turbochargers, torque converter, mechatronic unit), adaptive air suspension, and sophisticated electrical systems, can be prone to failure as the vehicle ages and accumulates mileage. These issues can be costly to repair due to the specialized nature of the parts and labor. Regular and thorough maintenance by qualified technicians is crucial to mitigate potential problems and maintain the vehicle's performance and longevity. While not plagued by widespread, common defects, owners should budget for potential repairs related to these known areas of concern.
