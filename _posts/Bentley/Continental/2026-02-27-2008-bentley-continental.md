### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Bentley Continental GT is a complex luxury vehicle where reliability is generally good, but potential issues exist, particularly with age and mileage. The W12 engine's twin-turbo setup and associated components like ignition coils and turbochargers can be costly to repair. The ZF automatic transmission, while robust, can experience torque converter or mechatronic unit failures. The adaptive air suspension is a common source of issues, with leaks in air springs or compressor failures being prevalent. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment system and door locking mechanisms, are also noted. Interior wear on high-use areas like the driver's seat is typical for a vehicle of this age. Owners should budget for potential repairs, especially for the powertrain and suspension, and ensure regular, specialized maintenance.
