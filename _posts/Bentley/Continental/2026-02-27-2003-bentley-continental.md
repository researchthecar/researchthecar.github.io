### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Bentley Continental GT is a remarkable vehicle, but its complexity means potential owners should budget for specialized maintenance and repairs. The W12 engine, while powerful, can experience turbocharger, cooling system, and ignition issues. The automatic transmission, though generally robust, may require attention to its control module or torque converter. The adaptive air suspension is a common source of expense, with leaks in air springs or compressor failure being notable. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment and convenience features like door locks and windows, can also arise. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to any developing problems, the Continental GT can remain a rewarding ownership experience.
