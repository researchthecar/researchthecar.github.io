The 2004 Bentley Continental GT marked a significant shift for the brand, blending luxury with performance in a grand touring package. The initial engine option was the formidable 6.0L Twin-Turbocharged W12 producing 552 hp and 479 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Continental GT is often praised for its opulent interior, powerful engine, and distinctive styling. Criticisms often include high maintenance costs and complex electronics.

**Engine**

**6.0L Twin-Turbocharged W12**

*   **Coil Pack Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, check engine light illumination. Often, one or more coil packs will fail, leading to decreased performance and fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty coil packs. It's often recommended to replace all 12 coil packs at once to ensure consistent performance and prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on whether DIY or shop).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, decreased performance, hissing sounds from the engine bay, check engine light. The complex vacuum system is prone to leaks due to aging hoses and fittings.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair or replace leaking vacuum hoses and fittings. Smoke testing is often used to pinpoint the source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the location and complexity of the leak).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant level, overheating, visible coolant leaks under the vehicle. The cooling system components, including hoses, water pump, and radiator, can develop leaks over time.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking hoses, water pump, radiator, or other cooling system components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ (depending on the component needing replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (ZF 6HP26A)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, transmission malfunction warning lights. The valve body within the transmission can experience wear and sticking valves, leading to these issues.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. In some cases, flushing the transmission and replacing the fluid can temporarily alleviate the symptoms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (depending on whether the valve body is rebuilt or replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling, complete loss of drive. The torque converter may fail due to internal damage or wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (including transmission removal and installation).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting low, inability to adjust ride height, warning lights on the dashboard. The air suspension compressor is responsible for maintaining the air pressure in the system.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one side or corner, hissing sound from the strut area, ride height adjustment issues. The air struts can develop leaks over time, causing the suspension to lose air pressure.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air strut(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ per strut (depending on whether it's a new or remanufactured unit).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting, requiring frequent jump starts. There can be parasitic draws on the electrical system that drain the battery when the vehicle is off.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic drain. This can involve tracing wiring, testing components, and identifying faulty modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity of the drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, blank screen, unresponsive buttons. The infotainment system can experience software glitches and hardware failures.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available), component replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the issue and solution).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation inside the headlight housings.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlight and allow the headlight housing to dry out. Apply new sealant and reassemble the headlight. Replacing the entire headlight assembly may be necessary in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ (depending on the extent of the issue and the chosen solution).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Buttons**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Buttons and trim pieces become sticky or tacky to the touch due to the degradation of the coating material.
    *   Solution: Cleaning with specialized products designed to remove the sticky residue, or replacement of the affected trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the amount of trim pieces that need to be fixed or replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Bentley Continental GT offers a luxurious and powerful driving experience, but it is not without its potential issues. Engine problems, such as coil pack failures and vacuum leaks, can impact performance and require attention. The 6-speed automatic transmission may exhibit valve body or torque converter issues. The air suspension system is prone to leaks and compressor failures. Electrical problems can range from battery drain to infotainment system malfunctions. The sticky button issue is also a well-known problem on this vehicle. Repair costs can be substantial, reflecting the car's original price point and the complexity of its systems. Therefore, a thorough pre-purchase inspection and diligent maintenance are crucial for prospective buyers.
