### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Bentley Continental GT demonstrates a high level of overall reliability, consistent with its luxury segment positioning. The W12 and V8 engines are robust, though potential issues with turbochargers, cooling systems, and ignition components can arise. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission is generally dependable, but TCM and torque converter issues are documented. The adaptive air suspension, while providing excellent comfort, is a potential source of costly repairs due to leaks or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are the most frequently cited non-routine concerns. Exterior and interior components, barring specific climate control actuators, are typically free of widespread issues. Owners should budget for potential repairs on the more complex systems, especially as the vehicle ages.
