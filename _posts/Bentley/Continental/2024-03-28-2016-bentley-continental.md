**Introduction**

The 2016 Bentley Continental, a pinnacle of automotive luxury, is powered by a potent 6.0L W12 engine producing 582 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Additionally, it offers a 4.0L V8 engine with 500 horsepower and 487 lb-ft of torque. The 8-speed automatic transmission seamlessly transfers power to all four wheels.

Transmission hesitations, suspension component wear, and electrical glitches further contribute to the potential for expensive repairs. While interior issues are generally minor, they still add to the overall cost of ownership. Owners should be prepared for higher maintenance and repair expenses than they would for a more common luxury vehicle.
