### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Bentley Continental, while a marvel of engineering, exhibits reliability patterns typical of high-end, complex luxury vehicles. The W12 and V8 engines, though powerful, can be susceptible to issues with turbocharger components and timing systems, which are costly to repair. The adaptive air suspension is a common source of problems, with leaks and compressor failures being relatively frequent. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment and central locking systems, also appear in owner reports. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, the potential for significant repair bills on powertrain and suspension components means that ongoing maintenance and potential repairs should be factored into ownership costs. Proactive diagnosis of any warning lights or unusual noises is highly recommended.
