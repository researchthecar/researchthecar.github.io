The 2007 Bentley Continental GT is a luxury grand tourer known for its opulent interior, powerful engine, and distinctive styling. The most common engine in the 2007 Bentley Continental GT is the 6.0L twin-turbocharged W12 engine which produces 552 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. The vehicle also came with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners praise the car for its comfortable ride, luxurious features, and impressive performance. However, some common complaints include high maintenance costs, electrical issues, and the car's large size which can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**6.0L Twin-Turbocharged W12**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, loss of power, and the check engine light may illuminate. This is often caused by heat and age-related degradation of the coil packs.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s). It's generally recommended to replace all coil packs at once for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on how many coil packs are replaced at once.

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, poor acceleration, and a hissing sound from the engine bay. Vacuum leaks can affect the engine's air-fuel mixture and overall performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the vacuum leak (often hoses or intake manifold gaskets) and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the severity and location of the leak.

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant leaks under the car. The W12 engine has a complex cooling system with many potential leak points.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair the coolant leak. This may involve replacing hoses, pipes, or the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the source of the leak.

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, whistling sound from the engine bay, and possible smoke. Turbochargers can fail due to oil starvation or age-related wear.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the turbocharger issue. If the turbocharger is faulty, it will likely need to be replaced or rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $6000+ depending on whether you replace or rebuild.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, slipping, and difficulty engaging gears. The torque converter can fail due to wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement of gears, and transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle sits low, especially on one corner, the suspension light is illuminated, and the compressor may run continuously. The compressor is responsible for maintaining the air pressure in the suspension system.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging overnight or after being parked, ride height variations, and a hissing sound from the air struts. Air struts can develop leaks due to age and wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air strut(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $4000+ per strut.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery discharges quickly, especially when the vehicle is parked for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replace the faulty component. This requires specialized electrical diagnostic skills.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.

*   **Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Screen freezing, navigation errors, audio system cutting out, and unresponsive buttons. The infotainment system can suffer from software glitches or hardware failures.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. If that doesn't work, the unit may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on the severity of the issue.

*   **Central Convenience Module Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic behavior of windows, locks, lights, and other convenience features. The central convenience module controls these systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the issue with the central convenience module. It may need to be reprogrammed or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture accumulating inside the headlight lenses. This can damage the headlight bulbs and reduce visibility.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlights and dry them out. Seal any cracks or openings to prevent future condensation. If the headlight is badly damaged, it may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for a repair, $500 - $3000+ for a replacement.

**Interior**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Screen goes blank, is fuzzy, or is not working at all.
    *   Solution: The unit will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+

*   **Wood Trim Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clear coat on the wood trim starts to crack over time.
    *   Solution: Refinishing the trim can be expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$5,000+

**Recalls:**
*   Recall Number: 09V029000
    *   Component: Electrical System
    *   Summary: Bentley Motors, Inc. is recalling 3,484 MY 2005-2009 Continental GT and GTC vehicles manufactured from March 2005 through December 2008. The battery positive cable may contact the hydraulic lines for the power steering and/or self-leveling suspension. If this occurs, the insulation on the battery positive cable may wear through, causing an electrical short circuit to ground.
    *   Consequence: An electrical short circuit could result in a fire.
    *   Remedy: Dealers will inspect and secure the battery positive cable, and add protective sheathing to the hydraulic lines free of charge. The recall began on February 13, 2009.

In summary, the 2007 Bentley Continental GT can suffer from a variety of issues, many of which are related to the age and complexity of the vehicle. Engine problems such as coil pack failures and vacuum leaks are common, as are suspension issues like air strut leaks and compressor failures. Electrical problems can also occur, with battery drains and infotainment system malfunctions being the most frequent. These issues can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to costly repairs, so prospective buyers should be aware of the potential maintenance costs associated with owning a vehicle of this age and complexity.
