### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Bentley Continental GT demonstrates a commendable level of reliability, especially considering its complex and high-performance nature. The primary areas where owners might encounter issues are related to the sophisticated W12 and V8 twin-turbocharged engines, particularly concerning the turbochargers and cooling systems. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, while generally robust, can occasionally suffer from TCM or torque converter problems. The adaptive air suspension is another area to monitor, with potential for leaks in air springs or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. However, the exterior and interior components are largely free from widespread technical defects. Overall, the Continental GT offers a reliable luxury experience, but owners should be prepared for the potential costs associated with maintaining its advanced systems.
