The 2016 Bentley Continental is a luxury grand tourer known for its opulent interior, powerful engine options, and refined driving experience. It's available as a coupe or convertible (GTC). While owners generally praise the Continental's comfort, craftsmanship, and performance, some common issues can arise. Engine options include a 4.0L twin-turbo V8 producing around 500-520 horsepower and 487-502 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.0L twin-turbo W12 generating approximately 582-633 horsepower and 531-619 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific variant. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some common complaints include high maintenance costs, electrical glitches, and occasional air suspension problems.
