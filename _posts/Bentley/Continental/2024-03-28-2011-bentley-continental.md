**Introduction:**

The 2011 Bentley Continental is a grand touring coupe or convertible that offers a luxurious and powerful driving experience. It comes with a 6.0L W12 engine and an 8-speed automatic transmission, producing 552 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. Despite its high-end appeal, the Continental has faced several issues that can detract from its overall reliability.

**Engine**

**6.0L W12**

* **Oil Leaks:** Oil leaks can occur from various seals and gaskets, including the oil pan gasket, valve cover gaskets, and camshaft seals. This can lead to low oil levels, engine damage, and costly repairs.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) System Failure:** The VVT system can fail due to faulty solenoids or sensors, leading to poor engine performance, reduced power output, and increased fuel consumption.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty solenoids or sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting:** Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifting, especially when accelerating or decelerating. This can be caused by faulty transmission solenoids or a malfunctioning transmission control module (TCM).
    * Solution: Replace the faulty solenoids or TCM.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure:** The air suspension compressor can fail, leading to a loss of air pressure in the suspension system. This can cause the vehicle to sit lower than expected, resulting in poor handling and reduced ground clearance.
    * Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Some owners have experienced battery draining issues, even when the vehicle is turned off. This can be caused by a faulty electrical component, such as a parasitic drain from the infotainment system or a malfunctioning module.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the faulty electrical component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Climate Control Malfunctions:** The climate control system can experience malfunctions, such as inoperative fans, faulty temperature sensors, or a failure of the entire system.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
