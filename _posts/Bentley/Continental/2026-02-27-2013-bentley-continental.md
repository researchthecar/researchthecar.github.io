### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Bentley Continental GT generally exhibits strong reliability, befitting its luxury status. The W12 and V8 engines are robust, though potential issues like turbocharger problems or coolant leaks can arise, with associated repair costs reflecting the complexity. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission is largely dependable, but TCM or torque converter issues can occur. The adaptive air suspension, while providing excellent comfort, is a common area for potential expense, with air spring leaks being the most frequent concern. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Exterior and interior components, barring specific climate control actuator issues, tend to hold up well. Overall, while not immune to problems, the Continental GT's reliability is good for its class, provided regular, high-quality maintenance is performed and potential issues are addressed promptly.
