### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Bentley Continental, while a marvel of engineering and luxury, exhibits some common high-end automotive issues. The W12 and V8 engines, though powerful, can be prone to turbocharger and coolant system problems, with associated repair costs reflecting their complexity. The ZF transmissions, particularly the 6-speed, may require attention to the torque converter or mechatronic unit. The adaptive air suspension is a notable area for potential expense, with leaks in air springs or compressor failures being the most common complaints. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also reported. While interior and exterior components are generally robust, specific issues like headlight condensation can occur. Overall, ownership requires a significant budget for maintenance and potential repairs, especially as the vehicle ages.
