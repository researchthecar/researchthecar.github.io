**Engine**

**6.75-liter Turbocharged V8**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, whistling or grinding noises from the engine bay, check engine light illumination. Often caused by oil starvation or bearing failure within the turbo.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger(s). Inspection of the oil lines to the turbochargers is essential to ensure proper lubrication.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+

*   **Valve Stem Seal Deterioration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blue smoke from the exhaust, especially during startup or after prolonged idling. Indicates oil leaking past the valve stem seals and into the combustion chamber.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve stem seals. This is a labor-intensive process as it typically requires removing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+

*   **Cooling System Issues (Radiator/Hoses)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks, elevated temperature gauge readings. Deterioration of rubber hoses and potential corrosion within the radiator are common culprits.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the radiator, hoses, thermostat, and coolant flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+

**Transmission**

**GM 4L80-E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement, erratic shifts, slipping between gears, or harsh engagement of gears. Could be caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low fluid level.
    *   Solution: A full transmission rebuild or replacement is the most common solution. Inspection and possible replacement of the valve body is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially during light acceleration. Can also cause stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter, along with a transmission fluid flush. Inspecting the transmission for further damage caused by the torque converter failure is essential.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
