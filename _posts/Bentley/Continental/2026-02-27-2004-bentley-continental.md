### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Bentley Continental GT, while a marvel of engineering, presents potential reliability considerations typical of a high-performance luxury vehicle. The 6.0L W12 engine, though powerful, can experience issues with turbochargers, ignition coils, and coolant leaks, with repair costs reflecting the complexity and exclusivity of the components. The ZF automatic transmission, while generally robust, may encounter problems with its control module or torque converter. The adaptive air suspension is prone to leaks in air springs and compressor failures, which can be costly to rectify. Electrical gremlins, particularly within the infotainment system and door lock actuators, are also noted. Despite these potential challenges, the exterior and interior materials are generally durable, with no widespread reported issues. Proactive maintenance and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended for owners of this exceptional grand tourer.
