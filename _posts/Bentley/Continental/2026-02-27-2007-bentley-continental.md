### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Bentley Continental GT is a remarkable vehicle, but its complexity means potential owners should budget for maintenance and occasional repairs beyond standard consumables. The W12 engine, while powerful, can experience issues with its turbochargers and ignition system. The sophisticated ZF automatic transmission may require attention to its control module or torque converter. The adaptive air suspension is a common source of concern, with leaks in air springs and compressor failures being notable. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and door locks, can also arise. Exterior and interior components, while luxurious, are not immune to issues like headlight condensation and wear on high-use leather. Overall, reliability is good for a supercar of its era, but proactive maintenance and a willingness to address specific known issues are essential for ownership satisfaction.
