The 2008 Bentley Continental GT is a luxury grand tourer known for its opulent interior, powerful engine, and distinctive styling. The most common configuration features a 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged W12 engine producing 552 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. A less common engine option for this year is a 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged W12 engine tuned to produce 600 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque in the Continental GT Speed. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the car's luxurious appointments, smooth ride, and effortless performance, while common complaints revolve around high maintenance costs, potential for expensive repairs, and complex electronics.

**Engine**

**6.0L Twin-Turbocharged W12 (552 HP, 479 lb-ft)**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, check engine light. Typically affects individual cylinders, leading to noticeable performance degradation.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s). It's often recommended to replace all coil packs at once for preventative maintenance.
