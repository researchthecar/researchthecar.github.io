### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Bentley Arnage is a magnificent vehicle, but its complexity and age mean that potential buyers should be prepared for maintenance costs. The 6.75L twin-turbo V8, while powerful, can experience issues with turbochargers and fluid leaks. The GM 4-speed automatic transmission is generally robust but can develop slipping or torque converter problems. The sophisticated hydraulic suspension system is a common source of expense due to leaks and actuator failures. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module or infotainment, are also noted. While the exterior and interior materials are high-quality, specific components like climate control actuators can fail. Regular, specialized servicing by technicians familiar with Bentley vehicles is paramount to mitigate these potential issues and ensure the Arnage remains a reliable luxury car.
