### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Bentley Arnage, while a magnificent luxury vehicle, requires diligent maintenance and awareness of its complex systems. The V8 twin-turbo engine is generally robust but can be prone to turbocharger, coolant, and oil leaks, which are common for high-performance engines of this era. Transmission issues, particularly with the older 4-speed unit, can arise, necessitating careful attention to fluid changes and potential internal repairs. The advanced Hydractive suspension, while providing an exceptional ride, can be a source of leaks and sensor problems. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and complexity. Overall, the Arnage offers a rewarding ownership experience, but potential buyers should be prepared for the higher maintenance costs associated with such a bespoke and powerful automobile.
