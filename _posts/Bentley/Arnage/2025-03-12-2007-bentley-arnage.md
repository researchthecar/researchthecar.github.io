The 2007 Bentley Arnage is a luxury grand tourer known for its opulent interior, powerful engine, and stately presence. It was offered with a 6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that produced around 450 horsepower and 645 lb-ft of torque. A later "T" version of the Arnage offered around 500 hp and 738 lb-ft of torque. All Arnage models came with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Arnage for its luxurious ride, handcrafted interior, and effortless performance. However, some common complaints include high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and potential reliability issues due to its age and sophisticated systems.

**Recalls:**

    *   Component: Engine and Engine Cooling: Engine
    *   Summary: Bentley is recalling certain model year 2007-2009 Arnage and Brooklands vehicles manufactured from June 2006 through January 2009. These vehicles were built with incorrectly manufactured front engine cover assembly, a component of the engine oil cooling system. This can cause engine oil to leak onto hot engine parts, creating a risk of fire.
    *   Remedy: Dealers will install an engine oil leak detection system to the engine, free of charge. The recall began on March 19, 2010. Owners may contact Bentley at 1-248-754-7500.

*   Recall Number: 07V494000
    *   Component: Suspension: Front: Control Arm: Lower Arm
    *   Summary: ON CERTAIN VEHICLES, THE LOWER FRONT SUSPENSION WISHBONE FOR THE FRONT SUSPENSION COULD BECOME CORRODED DUE TO THE ELECTROLYTIC REACTION BETWEEN THE WISHBONE AND THE STEEL NUT WHICH SECURES THE FRONT BALL JOINT. THIS COULD EVENTUALLY RESULT IN THE SEPARATION OF THE WISHBONE FROM THE BALL JOINT.
    *   Remedy: DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE LOWER FRONT SUSPENSION WISHBONE, FRONT BALL JOINT, THE NUT, AND CHECK THE FRONT UPPER SUSPENSION WISHBONE FOR CORROSION FREE OF CHARGE. THE RECALL BEGAN OCTOBER 1, 2007. OWNERS MAY CONTACT BENTLEY AT 1-248-754-7500.

**Summary:** The 2007 Bentley Arnage, while a symbol of luxury and performance, presents potential owners with a range of issues. Engine and transmission problems can be costly to repair, as can the air suspension system. Electrical gremlins are also a common concern. The high cost of parts and specialized labor contribute to significant ownership expenses. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's history, conduct a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, and factor in the potential for significant repair bills.
