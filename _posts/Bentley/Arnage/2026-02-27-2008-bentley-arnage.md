### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Bentley Arnage, while a magnificent machine, requires diligent ownership. Its powerful 6.75L V8 engine and sophisticated transmissions (both 4-speed and 6-speed options) are generally reliable but can incur significant repair costs if issues arise, particularly with turbochargers, torque converters, and mechatronic units. The hydropneumatic suspension, a hallmark of its comfort, can be a source of expensive leaks and component failures. Electrical gremlins, though not pervasive, can manifest as window regulator problems or infotainment glitches. Interior and exterior components, while luxurious, are susceptible to age-related wear such as paint issues and leather degradation. Regular, specialized maintenance is paramount to mitigating these potential problems and ensuring the Arnage remains a dependable and luxurious grand tourer.
