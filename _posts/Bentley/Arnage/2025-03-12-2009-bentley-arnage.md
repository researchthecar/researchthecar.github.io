The 2009 Bentley Arnage is a luxurious grand tourer known for its powerful engine, opulent interior, and stately presence. It was offered with a 6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing around 500 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque (depending on the specific model variant, such as the Arnage T or Arnage R). The only transmission option was a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Arnage for its comfortable ride, powerful engine, and handcrafted interior. Criticisms often focus on its high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and large size, which can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

Engine and transmission problems, especially with the turbochargers and valve body, can be costly. Air suspension issues are also a common complaint, potentially leading to expensive repairs. Electrical gremlins and interior trim concerns further contribute to the overall ownership cost.
