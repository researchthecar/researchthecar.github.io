### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Bentley Arnage is a complex luxury vehicle where reliability hinges on meticulous maintenance and prompt attention to specific potential issues. The twin-turbocharged V8 engine, while powerful, can be prone to turbocharger wear, coolant, and oil leaks, requiring vigilant monitoring. The GM automatic transmission, though generally robust, may exhibit slipping or torque converter problems over time. The hydropneumatic suspension is a notable area for potential leaks and sensor issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators, central locking, and infotainment, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and complexity. While the exterior and interior materials are generally durable, specific components like the HVAC blower motor can require attention. Overall, the Arnage demands a significant investment in upkeep, but for those prepared for it, it remains a rewarding ownership experience.
