**Summary:**

The 2002 Bentley Arnage offers a unique combination of luxury and performance but has faced various issues throughout its lifespan. The engine and transmission components are prone to coolant leaks, intake manifold failures, slipping gears, and fluid leaks. The suspension system may encounter air suspension failures and strut mount issues. Electrical problems, door handle failures, dashboard cracking, and navigation system malfunctions are also reported. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be costly and require significant repairs. Potential owners should be aware of these concerns before purchasing and factor in potential repair costs.
