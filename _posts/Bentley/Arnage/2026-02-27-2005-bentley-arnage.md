### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Bentley Arnage is a complex luxury vehicle where reliability is highly dependent on maintenance history and the specific components that may age. The powerful 6.75L V8 engine, while robust, can encounter issues with its turbochargers and cooling systems. Transmission reliability varies between the 4-speed and 6-speed automatic options, with potential for slipping gears or mechatronic unit failures. The sophisticated hydraulic suspension requires attention to prevent leaks. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Body Control Module and infotainment, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age. While the exterior and interior materials are generally durable, specific components like window regulators and climate control actuators can fail. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for ensuring long-term reliability and avoiding significant repair costs.
