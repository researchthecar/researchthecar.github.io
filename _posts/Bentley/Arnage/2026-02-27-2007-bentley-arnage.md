### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Bentley Arnage, while a magnificent vehicle, requires diligent maintenance and awareness of potential issues. The 6.75L V8 engine, though powerful, can be prone to turbocharger, coolant, and oil leaks, with repair costs reflecting its complexity. The 4-speed automatic transmission, while robust, may experience slipping or torque converter issues over time. The hydropneumatic suspension is a notable area for potential leaks and actuator problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and infotainment, are also documented. Despite these points, the exterior and interior generally hold up well, with the primary concern for the interior being the climate control blower motor. Overall, the Arnage is a reliable luxury car for its era, but owners should budget for specialized maintenance and potential repairs.
