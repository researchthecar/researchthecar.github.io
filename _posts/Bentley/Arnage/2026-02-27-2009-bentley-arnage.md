### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Bentley Arnage, while a magnificent vehicle, demands significant investment in maintenance and potential repairs. Its powerful 6.75L twin-turbo V8 and sophisticated hydraulic suspension are prone to issues like turbocharger failure, coolant/oil leaks, and hydraulic system problems, which can be costly to address. The transmission, typically a GM 4-speed automatic, can experience solenoid or torque converter issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and window regulators, are also noted. Interior components like leather and wood trim may show wear over time, requiring specialized care. Owners should budget for higher-than-average maintenance costs and be prepared for potential expensive repairs, especially as the vehicle ages. Despite these potential drawbacks, the Arnage remains a symbol of automotive luxury and performance for those willing to maintain it.
