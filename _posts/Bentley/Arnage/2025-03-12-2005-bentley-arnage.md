The 2005 Bentley Arnage is a luxury sedan known for its opulent interior, powerful engine, and stately presence. The primary engine option for this year was a 6.75-liter turbocharged V8, producing around 450 horsepower and 645 lb-ft of torque. A key highlight of the Arnage is its hand-crafted interior and smooth ride. Conversely, common dislikes include the car's significant running costs (fuel consumption, maintenance), age related reliability issues, and overall size which makes it less nimble than some competitors. The Arnage came exclusively with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.75-Liter Turbocharged V8**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, reduced power, potential for excessive smoke from the exhaust. The turbocharger bearings wear prematurely due to oil starvation or general wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed turbocharger(s). Ensure proper oil feed lines are inspected and cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, low oil level warning light. Common leak points include valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, and oil cooler lines.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals. Inspect and replace damaged oil cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased engine performance, and potential for the engine to stall. Vacuum leaks often occur due to cracked or brittle vacuum hoses.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the vacuum leak and replace the affected hoses. Smoke testing can be beneficial for identifying these leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair

* **Cooling System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks, and potential for engine damage. Common issues include failing water pumps, radiator leaks, and thermostat issues.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty water pump, radiator, or thermostat. Pressure test the cooling system to identify leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the specific component and labor costs.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or jerky shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Check and replace the transmission fluid. Consider a transmission service including filter replacement. In more severe cases, valve body rebuild or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This can occur in one or more gears.
    *   Solution: Inspect transmission fluid level and condition. A full transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits unevenly, compressor runs excessively, "Suspension Fault" warning light. Leaks often occur at air struts or air lines.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking air struts, air lines, or compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ per strut

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises, poor handling, uneven tire wear. Common culprits include worn ball joints, control arm bushings, and sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension components. A wheel alignment is recommended after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery dies quickly, especially when the car is not used for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include faulty modules, lights left on, or an aging battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the source of the drain

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, various fault codes, and potential for degraded engine performance or other system malfunctions. Common sensor failures include oxygen sensors, crankshaft position sensors, and mass airflow sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning navigation, radio, or display screen. Intermittent or complete failure of the infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the issue and repair or replace the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dim or non-functioning headlights, flickering headlights, and issues with the automatic leveling system.

**Summary:**

The 2005 Bentley Arnage, while a pinnacle of luxury, can present owners with a range of issues, particularly due to its age and complex systems. Engine and transmission problems, especially related to the turbocharger and age related wear, can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical gremlins are also relatively common. While some issues are minor, others can be significant and expensive, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential.
