The 2014 Bentley Flying Spur is a robust luxury sedan with a strong overall reliability record. The powertrain (6.0L W12 engine and ZF 8-speed automatic transmission) is exceptionally well-engineered and rarely presents significant issues beyond routine maintenance. The most common areas for potential concern lie within the sophisticated adaptive air suspension system, where leaks or compressor failures can occur, and the complex electrical systems, particularly the infotainment unit which may experience software glitches. While these issues can be costly to repair due to the specialized nature of the vehicle, they are not indicative of widespread systemic failures. With proper care and attention to potential suspension and electrical quirks, the Flying Spur should provide a dependable and luxurious ownership experience.
