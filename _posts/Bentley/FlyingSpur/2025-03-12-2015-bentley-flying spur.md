The 2015 Bentley Flying Spur represents the pinnacle of luxury sedans, offering a blend of handcrafted elegance and exhilarating performance. It was available with two engine options: a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 producing 500 horsepower and 487 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged W12 generating 616 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque in the standard version and 626 hp and 605 lb-ft of torque in the W12 S version. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Flying Spur for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and powerful engines. Common complaints tend to center around high maintenance costs, occasional electrical glitches, and the sheer size of the vehicle, which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces.
