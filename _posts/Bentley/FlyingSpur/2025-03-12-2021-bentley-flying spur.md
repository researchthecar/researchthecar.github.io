The 2021 Bentley Flying Spur is a luxury sedan that blends performance with opulence. The vehicle is known for its handcrafted interior, smooth ride, and powerful engine options. Engine choices included a 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged W12 engine producing 626 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine making 542 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque. A plug-in hybrid (PHEV) variant using a 2.9L V6 was later available. All engines are paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the Flying Spur's lavish interior, comfortable ride, and powerful performance.

**Summary**

The 2021 Bentley Flying Spur offers a luxurious driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, the potential costs for repair can be significant due to the car's complexity and high-end components. Issues like oil leaks, turbocharger failures, and suspension problems can lead to costly repairs. Electrical glitches, particularly within the infotainment system, are also relatively common. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's history, consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, and factor in the potential for higher maintenance costs.
