The powertrain (both W12 and V8 engines, and the 8-speed automatic transmission) is exceptionally robust with no significant widespread issues reported. The primary areas where owners might encounter technical concerns are within the complex adaptive air suspension system, specifically potential leaks in air springs or compressor failures, and occasional electrical gremlins such as infotainment system glitches or faulty door lock actuators. These issues, while not common, can be costly to repair due to the specialized nature of the vehicle. Exterior and interior components, including upholstery and lighting, are generally free from significant defects. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of suspension or electrical anomalies are recommended for optimal long-term ownership.
