### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Bentley Bentayga, while a marvel of engineering and luxury, exhibits some technical reliability concerns typical of high-end, complex vehicles. The W12 and V8 engines, though powerful, can experience issues with turbochargers and ignition components, respectively. The adaptive air suspension is prone to leaks and compressor failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While the interior and exterior generally hold up well, the sophisticated mechanical and electrical systems require diligent maintenance and can present significant repair bills if issues arise. Overall, the Bentayga offers a luxurious experience, but potential buyers should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair costs.
