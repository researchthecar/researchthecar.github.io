The 2022 Bentley Bentayga represents the pinnacle of luxury SUVs, blending handcrafted elegance with impressive performance. The standard engine is a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 producing 542 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque. A plug-in hybrid powertrain is also available, combining a 3.0-liter V6 engine with an electric motor. All Bentaygas utilize an eight-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Bentayga for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and commanding presence. However, some criticisms include the high price tag, complex electronics, and potential for expensive repairs.
