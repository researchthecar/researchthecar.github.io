The 2017 Bentley Mulsanne represents the pinnacle of luxury and handcrafted automotive excellence. Powered by a 6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, it delivers 505 horsepower and a staggering 752 lb-ft of torque, ensuring effortless performance. A higher-performance "Speed" variant boosts output to 530 horsepower and 811 lb-ft of torque. Both versions are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Mulsanne's opulent interior, smooth ride, and commanding presence. Criticisms tend to focus on its considerable size, fuel consumption, and potential for expensive maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**6.75-Liter Twin-Turbocharged V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various points on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals is the typical solution. For turbocharger oil lines, replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The twin-turbochargers can experience issues such as wastegate malfunctions or bearing failures, leading to reduced boost pressure, power loss, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific issue (wastegate, bearing) is crucial. Replacement of the turbocharger may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported occasional rough shifting or hesitation during gear changes, particularly at lower speeds. This can manifest as a noticeable jerk or delay when shifting.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update might resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can develop leaks in the air struts or lines, leading to a sagging vehicle, uneven ride height, and the "Suspension Fault" warning light. The air compressor can also fail.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air strut(s) or lines is required. A failing air compressor also needs replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ (per strut)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur, especially if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods. This can result in a dead battery and the inability to start the car.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic drain is necessary. This could involve checking various electrical components and modules. A battery tender can help mitigate the issue during periods of inactivity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    * Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, the infotainment unit itself might need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with parking sensors and blind spot monitoring system sensors can occur. Symptoms include false alarms, non-functional sensors, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected sensor is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Trim Delamination/Loosening**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some interior trim pieces, particularly those made of wood or veneer, can delaminate or become loose over time due to temperature fluctuations or adhesive failure.
    *   Solution: Re-gluing or replacing the affected trim piece is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Bentley Mulsanne, while offering unparalleled luxury, is prone to issues commensurate with a high-end, complex vehicle. Engine oil leaks, turbocharger problems, and air suspension malfunctions can lead to significant repair costs. Electrical issues such as battery drain and infotainment glitches can be frustrating. While some problems may be relatively minor, others can be quite severe, potentially costing thousands of dollars to rectify. Pre-purchase inspections and thorough maintenance records are crucial when considering a used Mulsanne to mitigate the risk of encountering these issues.
