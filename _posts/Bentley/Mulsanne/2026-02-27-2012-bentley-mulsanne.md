### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Bentley Mulsanne is a vehicle of exceptional engineering and luxury. While it generally exhibits strong reliability, owners should be aware of potential issues related to its advanced powertrain and sophisticated electronic systems. The twin-turbo V8 engine and automatic transmission, while powerful, can experience issues with turbochargers, coolant leaks, transmission control modules, and torque converters, often requiring specialized and costly repairs. The adaptive air suspension is another area where component failures, such as air spring leaks or compressor issues, can arise. Electrical systems, particularly the infotainment and body control modules, may also present intermittent faults. Despite these potential concerns, the Mulsanne's build quality is high, and with proper, diligent maintenance by qualified technicians, it remains a dependable ultra-luxury automobile.
