The 2019 Bentley Mulsanne is the pinnacle of luxury sedans, offering a blend of handcrafted details, powerful performance, and unparalleled comfort. It comes standard with a 6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 505 horsepower and 752 lb-ft of torque in the standard Mulsanne or 530 horsepower and 811 lb-ft of torque in the Mulsanne Speed. Power is delivered through an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners love the car's opulent interior, smooth ride, and exclusivity. Criticisms often revolve around the car's considerable size, fuel economy, and high running costs. Due to the low production volume, comprehensive and widely reported issues are relatively scarce compared to mass-market vehicles. However, some common concerns can be gathered from owner forums, repair data, and professional reviews.

**Summary**

The 2019 Bentley Mulsanne, while a symbol of luxury and performance, is not immune to potential issues. Due to the car's sophisticated technology and bespoke construction, repairs can be costly. The most common concerns revolve around the engine (oil leaks, turbocharger issues), suspension (air suspension problems), and electrical systems (infotainment glitches, battery drain). While many issues are minor, some can be quite expensive to resolve, especially those related to the engine, transmission, and air suspension. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified Bentley technician to identify any existing or potential problems. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to significant mechanical failures. Costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to tens of thousands of dollars for major engine or transmission overhauls.
