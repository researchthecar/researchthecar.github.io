**Introduction**

The 2020 Bentley Mulsanne is a luxurious flagship sedan hand-built in Crewe, England. It offers an unparalleled blend of comfort, refinement, and performance. Under the hood lies a mighty 6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission, delivering a thunderous 530 horsepower and 811 lb-ft of torque. Despite its massive size and weight, the Mulsanne accelerates with authority and achieves a top speed of 190 mph. Its plush interior features exquisite materials and advanced technology, while the exterior exudes elegance with its iconic styling. However, despite its high price tag, the Mulsanne has not escaped some nagging issues.

**Engine**

**6.75L Twin-Turbocharged V8**

* **Intake Manifold Failure:** Over time, the intake manifold can develop cracks, causing vacuum leaks and a drop in engine power. The solution involves replacing the intake manifold, which can cost between $3,000 - $5,000+.
* **Turbocharger Actuator Malfunction:** The turbocharger actuators may fail, leading to reduced boost pressure and sluggish performance. Replacing the actuators can cost around $2,000 - $3,000+.

**Transmission**

**ZF Eight-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Hesitation:** Some Mulsannes experience hesitation or delayed shifts, particularly when downshifting. Updating the transmission software can resolve this issue. The software update is typically free.

**Suspension**

**No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

**Central Control Module Failure:** The central control module, responsible for controlling various electronic functions, can malfunction, causing glitches or a complete loss of electronics. Replacing the module can cost around $5,000 - $7,000+.
* **Battery Drain:** Some Mulsannes have reported unusual battery drain issues, even when the vehicle is not in use. Diagnosing and resolving this issue can vary greatly in cost depending on the underlying cause.

**Exterior**

**No Issues Found**

**Interior**

**In-Car Entertainment System Glitches:** The in-car entertainment system may experience occasional glitches, such as freezing or slow response times. A software update can typically resolve these issues. The software update is typically free.
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may malfunction, leading to inaccurate temperature control or failure to circulate air. This can often be resolved by replacing the climate control module, which costs around $1,000 - $2,000+.

**Summary**

While the 2020 Bentley Mulsanne is a remarkable vehicle, it is not immune to some common issues. The engine intake manifold and turbocharger actuator malfunctions can lead to decreased performance, while electrical problems such as central control module failure can be costly to fix. The transmission shifting hesitation can be resolved through a software update, while interior issues like in-car entertainment system glitches and climate control malfunctions are relatively minor. Overall, the severity and cost of the issues are not significant considering the high price tag of the Mulsanne, but they do represent potential concerns for potential buyers.
