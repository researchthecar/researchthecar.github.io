The 2020 Bentley Mulsanne, a symbol of British luxury and craftsmanship, entered its final year of production in this iteration. Powered by a hand-built 6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, the Mulsanne produced a formidable 505 horsepower and a staggering 752 lb-ft of torque in its standard form, and 530 horsepower and 811 lb-ft of torque in the Speed variant. The Mulsanne was exclusively equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners adored the Mulsanne for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and undeniable presence. Criticisms often revolved around its considerable size, fuel consumption, and the complexity of its systems, which could lead to maintenance challenges.

**Summary:**

The 2020 Bentley Mulsanne, while a masterpiece of automotive engineering, can present owners with some notable issues. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger issues can lead to significant repair bills. Suspension and electrical issues may occur, but are not as common as engine issues. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs potentially reaching into the thousands of dollars. Potential buyers should ensure a thorough inspection, including a detailed service history review, to mitigate the risk of unexpected expenses.
