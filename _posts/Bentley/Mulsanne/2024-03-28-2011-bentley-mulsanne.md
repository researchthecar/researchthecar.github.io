Symptoms include excessive oil consumption, abnormal engine noises, and reduced power output. Solution involves engine rebuild or replacement. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $15,000 - $30,000+
  * **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** Failure of the timing chain tensioner can cause the timing chain to slip, resulting in engine damage. Symptoms include rattling noises from the engine, reduced power output, and check engine light illumination. Solution involves replacing the timing chain tensioner and adjusting the timing. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $3,000 - $5,000
  * **Intake Valve Carbon Buildup:** Carbon deposits on the intake valves can restrict airflow, reducing engine performance. Symptoms include reduced power output, hesitation during acceleration, and increased fuel consumption. Solution involves intake manifold removal and cleaning of the valves. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000 - $2,000

**Transmission**

* **8-speed Automatic Transmission**

  * **Valve Body Failure:** Failure of the valve body can cause problems with gear shifting, such as delayed or harsh shifts, slipping gears, and loss of drive. Solution involves replacing the valve body. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $3,000 - $5,000
  * **Torque Converter Failure:** Failure of the torque converter can cause shuddering during acceleration, overheating, and transmission slipping. Solution involves replacing the torque converter. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,000 - $4,000
  * **Transmission Fluid Leak:** Leaks in the transmission fluid lines or seals can cause loss of fluid, leading to transmission damage. Symptoms include rough shifting, slipping gears, and whining noises from the transmission. Solution involves identifying and repairing the leak. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500

* **6-speed Automatic Transmission**

  * **Solenoid Failure:** Failure of the solenoid can cause shifting problems, such as delayed or no shifting, and transmission shuddering. Solution involves replacing the solenoid. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000
  * **Overheating:** The 6-speed transmission can overheat during heavy use or towing, leading to premature wear and failure. Symptoms include transmission slipping, delayed shifting, and a burning smell. Solution involves replacing the transmission cooler or modifying the cooling system. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $3,000
  * **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension:**
  * **Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure:** Failure of the lower control arm bushings can cause excessive vibration, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Symptoms include a clunking or rattling noise from the front end of the vehicle, especially over bumps or during braking. Solution involves replacing the worn bushings. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000
  * **Air Suspension Compressor Failure:** Failure of the air suspension compressor can cause the vehicle to sag or ride unevenly. Symptoms include a noticeable change in ride height, reduced handling, and a hissing noise from the suspension. Solution involves replacing the compressor. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,000 - $4,000
* **Rear Suspension:**
  * **Rear Upper Control Arm Bushing Failure:** Failure of the rear upper control arm bushings can cause excessive vibration, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Symptoms include a clunking or rattling noise from the rear end of the vehicle, especially over bumps or during braking. Solution involves replacing the worn bushings. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000
  * **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Battery Discharge:** A parasitic draw on the battery can cause it to discharge prematurely, leading to starting issues. Symptoms include a dead battery after a period of non-use, dim headlights, and flickering interior lights. Solution involves tracing the parasitic draw and repairing the fault. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $1,000
* **Electrical System Failure:** Failure of the electrical system, such as a faulty alternator or wiring harness, can cause various electrical problems, including loss of power, malfunctioning components, and battery charging issues. Symptoms vary depending on the specific fault. Solution involves diagnosing and repairing the faulty component. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $3,000
* **No Issues Found**

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Drain Plugging:** Clogged sunroof drains can cause water to leak into the car's interior, damaging the headliner, carpeting, and other components. Symptoms include water stains on the headliner, musty odors, and electrical malfunctions. Solution involves cleaning the drains and ensuring proper water flow. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500
* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Touchscreen Malfunction:** The infotainment touchscreen may malfunction, causing intermittent or permanent loss of functionality. Symptoms include a black or frozen screen, unresponsive touchscreen, and error messages. Solution involves resetting the system or replacing the touchscreen. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000 - $2,500
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** Problems with the climate control system, such as a faulty compressor or blend door, can cause insufficient heating or cooling, uneven airflow distribution, or a lack of response to inputs.
