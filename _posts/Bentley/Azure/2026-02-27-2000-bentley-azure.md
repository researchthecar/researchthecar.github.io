# 2000 Bentley Azure

### Overview
The 2000 Bentley Azure, a grand tourer known for its luxurious appointments and powerful performance, presents a generally robust, albeit complex, ownership experience. As a vehicle from this era, particularly one with a bespoke British heritage, certain areas require diligent attention. While the core mechanicals are designed for durability, the intricate nature of its systems means that specific components can be prone to issues, often related to age and the sophisticated technology employed. Owners should be prepared for potential costs associated with specialized maintenance and the repair of unique electrical and hydraulic systems. The Azure's appeal lies in its exclusivity and driving dynamics, but this comes with the expectation of higher-than-average running costs and the need for expert servicing.

### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Bentley Azure is a magnificent vehicle that, while generally well-built, demands specialized care due to its age and complexity. The primary areas of concern revolve around its sophisticated hydraulic systems (suspension and convertible top), intricate electrical components like the BCM, and the robust yet aging powertrain. Turbocharger seals and coolant leaks are not uncommon for the V8 engine. Transmission issues, particularly with solenoids and torque converters, can arise. Owners should budget for potential repairs, especially for the unique self-leveling suspension and the convertible top's hydraulic elements. While the exterior and interior materials are of high quality, the electronic interfaces can show their age. Regular, expert maintenance is crucial for preserving the Azure's performance and luxury.
