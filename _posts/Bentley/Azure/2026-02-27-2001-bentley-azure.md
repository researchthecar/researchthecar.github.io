### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Bentley Azure, while a magnificent vehicle, requires diligent maintenance and awareness of its potential age-related issues. The engine and transmission, though robust, can develop problems with seals, solenoids, or torque converters. The complex hydraulic suspension system is a notable area for potential leaks and sensor failures. Electrical components, particularly window regulators and central locking, can also be points of concern. The convertible top mechanism and its associated hydraulics are also susceptible to wear. Owners should budget for specialized repairs, as parts and labor for a vehicle of this caliber are premium. Despite these potential issues, with proper care and timely repairs, the Azure remains a desirable and capable luxury automobile.
