**Summary**

The 2008 Bentley Azure, while a beautiful and luxurious car, can be prone to a range of issues. Many of these stem from the age of the vehicle, the complexity of its systems, and the high cost of parts and labor. Engine and suspension issues, in particular, can be very expensive to address. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with Bentley vehicles. Due to the relatively low volume of these vehicles, parts availability can sometimes be an issue as well.
