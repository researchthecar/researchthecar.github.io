### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Bentley Azure is a vehicle of exceptional craftsmanship, but its complexity and age mean certain components can require attention. The powertrain, particularly the twin-turbo V12 engine and its associated systems, along with the adaptive air suspension and the intricate convertible top mechanism, are the most common areas for potential issues. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment and convertible top controls, can also arise. While the interior and exterior are generally robust, specific component failures can be costly to repair due to the specialized nature of the vehicle and the high cost of parts and labor. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for long-term reliability.
