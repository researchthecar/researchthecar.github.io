### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Land Rover Range Rover Sport offers a compelling blend of luxury and capability. However, potential buyers should be aware of certain reliability concerns, particularly with the adaptive air suspension, which can be costly to repair if leaks or sensor issues arise. Engine-related problems, such as timing chain wear on both V6 and V8 models, are significant but often preventable with diligent maintenance. Electrical gremlins, especially concerning the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While the transmission is generally robust, fluid leaks and software glitches can occur. Overall, while not plagued by widespread critical failures, the Range Rover Sport demands attentive maintenance and a budget for potential repairs, especially as it ages.
