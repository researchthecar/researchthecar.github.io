### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Range Rover Sport is a capable luxury SUV, but its complexity can lead to notable reliability concerns, particularly with the powertrain and adaptive air suspension. The V8 engine, while powerful, is prone to expensive timing chain issues. Both engines can suffer from coolant leaks and belt problems. The 8-speed automatic transmission can exhibit shifting issues, and the air suspension is susceptible to leaks and sensor failures. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also reported. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, potential buyers should budget for potential repairs, especially if purchasing a vehicle with higher mileage or without a comprehensive service history.
