# 2024 Land Rover Range Rover Sport

### Overview
The 2024 Land Rover Range Rover Sport aims to blend luxury, performance, and off-road capability. As a relatively new model year, comprehensive long-term reliability data is still emerging. However, initial reports and the model's established platform suggest a generally robust vehicle, particularly in its core mechanicals. Owners can expect a premium driving experience, but as with any high-end luxury SUV, potential issues can arise, often related to complex electronic systems or specialized components. This analysis focuses on documented or commonly anticipated technical concerns, excluding routine maintenance and standard wear and tear, to provide a clear picture of potential reliability hotspots.

### Summary Verdict
The 2024 Land Rover Range Rover Sport presents a generally strong reliability profile, especially concerning its core powertrain options. The widely used ZF 8-speed automatic transmission is known for its durability. However, the complexity of its advanced systems, particularly the adaptive air suspension and the mild-hybrid system on the P400 engine, introduces potential points of failure that can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, primarily within the infotainment and ADAS, are also noted, though often resolvable with software updates. Owners should be prepared for the possibility of higher repair costs associated with these sophisticated features compared to less complex vehicles. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for maintaining long-term reliability.
