### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a capable luxury SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of its reliability concerns, particularly regarding the air suspension and certain engine components. The V8 engine's timing chain tensioners and the diesel's turbochargers are known weak points that can lead to substantial repair bills. Transmission issues, especially with the mechatronic unit, are also a concern. Electrical gremlins and battery drain can add to the ownership costs. While the interior and exterior are generally well-built, the mechanical and electrical systems require diligent maintenance and can be expensive to repair when problems arise. It is advisable to have a thorough pre-purchase inspection, especially focusing on the aforementioned areas.
