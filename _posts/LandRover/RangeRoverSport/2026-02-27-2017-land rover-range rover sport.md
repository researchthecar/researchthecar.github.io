### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Land Rover Range Rover Sport offers a compelling package of luxury and capability. However, potential buyers and owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The air suspension system is a notable area for potential issues, with leaks and compressor failures being common. Engine options, particularly the V6 and V8 supercharged variants, can experience coolant leaks and timing chain wear, while diesel models may face DPF and EGR problems. Transmission issues like hesitation and mechatronic unit failures can also arise. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also reported. Exterior and interior components like door seals, headlight condensation, and headliner sagging are less critical but still represent potential repair costs. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, the Range Rover Sport demands diligent maintenance and a budget for potential repairs, especially concerning its advanced systems.
