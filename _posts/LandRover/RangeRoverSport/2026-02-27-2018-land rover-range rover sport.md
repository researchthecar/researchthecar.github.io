### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Sport, particularly with its more powerful V6 and V8 engines, presents some potential reliability concerns primarily related to the cooling system, timing components, and the sophisticated air suspension. Electrical issues, especially with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission and the plug-in hybrid powertrain have shown good reliability. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, owners should be aware of these potential repair costs and consider proactive maintenance, especially for the air suspension and engine-specific components, to ensure long-term dependability.
