# 2009 Land Rover Range Rover Sport

### Overview
The 2009 Land Rover Range Rover Sport, while offering a luxurious and capable off-road experience, presents a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. This model year, particularly with its more complex systems, can be prone to certain issues that require attention. Owners often report a higher than average incidence of electrical gremlins and suspension-related problems, which can be costly to repair. The powertrain, especially the diesel variants, can also experience specific component failures. Regular and diligent maintenance is crucial for mitigating these potential problems and ensuring the longevity of the vehicle. Prospective buyers should be aware of these common areas of concern and factor potential repair costs into their ownership budget.

### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Range Rover Sport is a capable luxury SUV, but its complexity contributes to a higher likelihood of encountering issues compared to less premium vehicles. The most common areas of concern are the air suspension system, electrical components (especially the BCM), and potential engine issues like timing chain problems in the V8 and turbo/injector issues in the diesel. Transmission issues, particularly with the mechatronic unit, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, the mechanical and electrical systems require diligent maintenance and can lead to significant repair bills. Buyers should be prepared for potential maintenance costs beyond routine servicing.
