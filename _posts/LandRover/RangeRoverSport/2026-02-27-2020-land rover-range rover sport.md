### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Land Rover Range Rover Sport, while a luxurious and capable SUV, presents some reliability concerns, particularly with its more powerful engine options and the sophisticated air suspension system. Owners may encounter issues such as coolant leaks and supercharger belt wear on the V6, and more significant problems like timing chain issues and oil leaks on the V8. The diesel engine can suffer from DPF-related problems. The air suspension is prone to leaks and compressor failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are also noted. While the transmission is generally robust, leaks and software glitches can occur. The exterior and interior systems show fewer widespread technical issues. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for mitigating potential repair costs and ensuring the longevity of this premium vehicle.
