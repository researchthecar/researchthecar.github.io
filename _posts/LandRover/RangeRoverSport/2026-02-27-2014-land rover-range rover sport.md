### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a capable and luxurious SUV, but it is not without its potential reliability concerns. Owners should be prepared for possible issues related to the complex air suspension system, particularly leaks and compressor failures. Engine-specific problems, such as coolant leaks and timing chain wear on both V6 and V8 variants, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, while less common, can also arise. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Exterior and interior components like sunroof drains and power seat actuators can also require attention. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for mitigating these potential problems and ensuring the longevity of the vehicle.
