### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Range Rover Sport is a capable luxury SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of its reliability concerns, particularly with the V8 gasoline engine's timing chain and the diesel's turbocharger. The automatic transmission can also be a source of expensive repairs. Air suspension components and electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, are also common complaints. While the exterior and interior generally fare better, specific issues like sunroof and heated seat failures can occur. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a budget for potential repairs are strongly advised for this model year.
