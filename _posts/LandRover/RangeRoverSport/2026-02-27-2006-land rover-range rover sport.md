### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Land Rover Range Rover Sport, particularly with the V8 engines, can be a rewarding vehicle to own, but it demands diligent maintenance and awareness of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine's timing chain tensioners and the complexity of the air suspension system, which can lead to substantial repair bills. Transmission issues, especially with the mechatronic unit, are also a notable concern. Electrical gremlins and interior component failures are less common but still reported. Owners opting for the standard coil spring suspension may find it more reliable than the air-sprung variants. Regular servicing and prompt attention to any warning signs are paramount to maintaining this luxury SUV.
