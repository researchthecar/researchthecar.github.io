### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a capable luxury SUV, but its complexity contributes to a higher likelihood of encountering mechanical and electrical issues compared to some competitors. The V8 gasoline engines are prone to timing chain and cooling system problems, while the diesel variants can suffer from turbo and injector failures. The air suspension system is a common source of expensive repairs, and the vehicle's intricate electrical systems are susceptible to various glitches and battery drain issues.
