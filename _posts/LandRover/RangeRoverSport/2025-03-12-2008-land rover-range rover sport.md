The 2008 Land Rover Range Rover Sport offered a blend of luxury, off-road capability, and performance, making it a popular choice for those seeking a prestigious SUV. Engine options included a 4.4-liter naturally aspirated V8 producing 300 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 4.2-liter supercharged V8 generating 390 horsepower and 410 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the vehicle's distinctive styling, opulent interior, and impressive off-road prowess. However, the Range Rover Sport, especially the 2008 model, is known for its higher-than-average maintenance costs and susceptibility to various mechanical and electrical issues. These potential problems are a significant concern for prospective buyers.
