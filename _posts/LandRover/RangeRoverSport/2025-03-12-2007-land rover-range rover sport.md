The 2007 Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a luxury SUV known for its off-road capabilities and stylish design. It was offered with two primary engine options: a 4.4L V8 producing 300 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque and a supercharged 4.2L V8 generating 390 horsepower and 410 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its luxurious interior, off-road prowess, and distinctive styling. However, the Range Rover Sport, particularly the 2007 model year, is also notorious for its reliability issues, especially with its complex electrical systems and air suspension, leading to high maintenance costs. People dislike the high fuel consumption, frequent repairs, and overall cost of ownership.
