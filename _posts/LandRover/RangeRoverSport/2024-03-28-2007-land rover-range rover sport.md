**4.4-liter V8**

* **Variable valve timing failure:** The variable valve timing system may fail, causing a loss of power and fuel economy. Symptoms include rough idling, stalling, and poor acceleration. The faulty variable valve timing system will need to be replaced. **$2,000 - $4,000+**
* **Intake manifold gasket leak:** The intake manifold gasket may leak, causing a loss of power and fuel economy. Symptoms include a rough idle and poor acceleration especially at higher RPM ranges. The faulty intake manifold gasket will need to be replaced. **$500 - $1,000+**
* **Camshaft sensor failure:** The camshaft sensor may fail, causing the engine to run rough or stall. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough idling, and stalling. The faulty camshaft sensor will need to be replaced. **$200 - $500+**

**Transmission**

**Six-speed Automatic**

* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter may shudder during gear changes. Symptoms include a vibration felt through the vehicle. The torque converter will need to be replaced. **$1,500 - $2,500+**
* **Transmission fluid leak:** The transmission may leak fluid, causing a loss of power and shifting problems. Symptoms include slipping gears, delayed engagement, and a burning smell. The faulty transmission pan gasket or transmission cooler lines will need to be replaced. **$500 - $1,500+**

**Suspension**

* **Air suspension failure:** The air suspension system may fail, causing the vehicle to ride low. Symptoms include a rough ride and uneven ride height. The faulty air suspension compressor or air struts will need to be replaced. **$1,000 - $2,000+**
* **Control arm bushings wear:** The control arm bushings may wear out, causing a clunking noise when driving over bumps. Symptoms include a clunking noise when driving over bumps and uneven tire wear. The faulty control arm bushings will need to be replaced. **$500 - $1,000+**

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** The battery may drain prematurely, causing the vehicle to not start. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle and a dead battery. The faulty alternator, starter, or parasitic drain will need to be diagnosed and replaced. **$500 - $1,500+**
* **Electrical gremlins:** The vehicle may experience electrical gremlins, such as flickering lights, malfunctioning gauges, and power window failures. Symptoms include intermittent electrical issues. The faulty electrical components will need to be diagnosed and replaced. **$200 - $1,000+**

**Exterior**

**Summary:**

The 2007 Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a reliable vehicle, but it is not without its issues. The most common problems include engine variable valve timing and intake manifold gasket failures, transmission torque converter shudder and fluid leaks, suspension air suspension failures and control arm bushing wear, electrical battery drain and electrical gremlins, exterior rear bumper cracking and headlight condensation, and interior climate control panel and navigation system failures. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but it is important to be aware of them before purchasing a used Range Rover Sport.
