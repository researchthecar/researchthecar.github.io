The 2012 Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a luxury SUV that blends off-road capability with on-road comfort and style. Available engine options include a 5.0L naturally aspirated V8 producing 375 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L supercharged V8 producing 510 horsepower and 461 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a ZF 6HP28 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Range Rover Sport for its luxurious interior, powerful engines, and off-road prowess. However, common complaints include poor fuel economy, high maintenance costs, and a reputation for unreliability.

**Engine**

**5.0L Naturally Aspirated V8**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold, can indicate stretched timing chains or worn tensioners. In severe cases, this can lead to misfires and engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chains, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant levels, overheating, and visible leaks around the engine bay. Common leak points include the water pump, thermostat housing, and radiator hoses.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking components and flushing the cooling system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L Supercharged V8**

*   **Supercharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or grinding noises from the supercharger, reduced engine power, and potential supercharger failure. The supercharger snout bearing and coupler are common failure points.
    *   Solution: Replacing the supercharger snout assembly, bearings, or the entire supercharger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as the naturally aspirated V8, a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold, can indicate stretched timing chains or worn tensioners. In severe cases, this can lead to misfires and engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chains, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor and checking for leaks in the air lines and air struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to compressor failure, sagging or uneven ride height indicates leaking air struts. The rubber bladders in the struts can deteriorate over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Land Rover Range Rover Sport, while offering luxury and capability, is prone to a number of significant issues. Engine problems, especially timing chain and coolant leaks in both the naturally aspirated and supercharged variants, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the ZF 6HP28 transmission, as well as air suspension problems, further contribute to the potential for high maintenance costs. Electrical gremlins can also be difficult and expensive to diagnose. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for expensive repairs and factor this into their purchasing decision. A thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
