**Engine**

**3.0L Supercharged V6**

*   **Supercharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, loss of power, check engine light. This can be caused by degradation of the supercharger snout isolator.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger or rebuild it, replacing the snout isolator and any other worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant levels, overheating, coolant smell, visible leaks near the water pump, thermostat housing, or coolant hoses.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Turbodiesel V6**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine power, warning messages related to the DPF. The DPF can become clogged, especially with frequent short trips.
    *   Solution: Attempt to regenerate the DPF through a forced regeneration cycle (performed by a mechanic or dealership). If regeneration fails, the DPF may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (for forced regeneration) - $2,000+ (for DPF replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idle, poor acceleration. The EGR valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, hesitation when accelerating, particularly between certain gears.
    *   Solution: First, try a transmission fluid flush and software update. If that doesn't work, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 (fluid flush/software), $1,500 - $3,000+ (valve body), $4,000 - $8,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, particularly when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging or leaning to one side, "Suspension Fault" warning light, inability to adjust ride height, loud noise from the compressor.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor. Also inspect the system for leaks that may have caused the compressor to overwork.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to compressor failure â€“ vehicle sagging, especially overnight, warning lights.

**Summary**

The 2016 Land Rover Range Rover Sport, while offering luxury and performance, is known for its reliability issues, which can lead to costly repairs. Engine problems, particularly with the timing chain and supercharger on the V8 and cooling and supercharger on the V6, are common and expensive to fix. The air suspension system is another area prone to failure, and electrical gremlins can also plague the vehicle. The 8-speed transmission can also experience issues. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in the potential for expensive repairs when considering purchasing a 2016 Range Rover Sport.
