### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Range Rover Sport offers a compelling blend of luxury and capability, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The V6 and V8 engines can experience coolant leaks and timing chain issues (V6) or supercharger belt problems and oil leaks (V8). The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, while generally robust, can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting or fluid leaks. The air suspension system is a common source of expensive repairs, with leaks in air springs or compressor failures being prevalent. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are generally solid, these powertrain and suspension issues represent the most significant potential costs for owners.
