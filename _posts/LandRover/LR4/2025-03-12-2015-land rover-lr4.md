**Summary**

The 2015 Land Rover LR4, while desirable for its luxury and off-road prowess, is prone to several issues. The most significant concern revolves around engine problems (timing chain tensioners, coolant leaks) and transmission issues, which can lead to substantial repair costs. Air suspension problems are also common and expensive to fix. Electrical gremlins, like battery drains and infotainment issues, add to the ownership experience. Owners should be prepared for potentially high maintenance costs and the need for regular preventative maintenance to mitigate these risks. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures.
