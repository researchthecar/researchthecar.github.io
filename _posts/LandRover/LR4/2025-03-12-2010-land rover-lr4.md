The 2010 Land Rover LR4, also known as the Discovery 4 in some markets, is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its off-road capabilities and comfortable interior. The 2010 model year was offered with two engine options: a 5.0L naturally aspirated V8 producing 375 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L supercharged V6 producing 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque in later models (This 3.0L engine option wasn't available in 2010). Both engines were paired with a ZF 6HP28 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the LR4's robust build, off-road prowess, and spacious cabin. However, common complaints revolve around reliability, high maintenance costs, and fuel economy.
