### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Land Rover LR4 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly in its powertrain. The 3.0L supercharged V6 engine and 8-speed automatic transmission are robust. However, potential owners should be aware of the air suspension system's susceptibility to leaks and sensor issues, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module or parasitic battery drain, are also documented concerns. While the exterior and interior are typically solid, these specific mechanical and electrical components represent the most common areas for technical attention beyond standard maintenance.
