The 2016 Land Rover LR4 is a luxury SUV known for its off-road capability and spacious interior. It came equipped with a single engine option: a 3.0-liter Supercharged V6 producing 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the LR4's ruggedness, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. However, common complaints revolve around reliability, higher-than-average maintenance costs, and fuel economy.

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor can fail, leading to the vehicle sitting low, uneven ride height, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air struts themselves can leak air, leading to similar symptoms as a compressor failure: sagging suspension, uneven ride height, and error messages.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air strut(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+ (per strut)
    *   Recalls: None Found
