**Engine**

**5.0L V8**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue involves premature wear or failure of the timing chain tensioners. Symptoms include a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold, and potential misfire codes. If left unaddressed, this can lead to significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially the VVT actuators.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump is prone to failure, leading to coolant leaks and potential overheating. Symptoms include low coolant levels, visible coolant leaks near the front of the engine, and a high temperature reading on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump, thermostat, and coolant flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the intake manifold, particularly the plastic components. Symptoms include rough idling, misfires, and potential lean codes (P0171, P0174).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ZF 6HP28 transmission can experience issues with the valve body, leading to harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system is prone to compressor failure. Symptoms include the vehicle failing to raise or lower properly, an "air suspension fault" message on the dashboard, and the compressor running continuously or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor. Consider replacing the relay as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks in the air struts are a common issue. Symptoms include the vehicle sagging on one or more corners overnight, a rough ride, and the air suspension compressor running more frequently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air strut(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Height Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The height sensors are responsible for reading the height of each corner of the vehicle so the suspension can adjust to the correct settings. Symptoms include suspension not adjusting correctly, ride-height control problems, warning lights on the dashboard, and difficulty calibrating the suspension system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the height sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can be a problem, leading to a dead battery overnight or after a few days of inactivity. Potential causes include parasitic draws from faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve replacing a faulty module, repairing wiring, or replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
