The 2014 Land Rover LR4 is a luxury SUV known for its off-road capabilities, spacious interior, and distinctive styling. The 2014 LR4 was only offered with a 3.0L Supercharged V6 engine producing 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the LR4's go-anywhere attitude, comfortable ride, and well-appointed interior. Common dislikes include relatively poor fuel economy, higher maintenance costs compared to other SUVs, and the potential for electrical issues.

**Engine**

**3.0L Supercharged V6**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can originate from various points in the cooling system, including the water pump, thermostat housing, radiator hoses, and coolant expansion tank. Symptoms include low coolant level, overheating, visible coolant puddles under the vehicle, and a sweet smell emanating from the engine bay.
    *   Solution: Locating and replacing the leaking component is necessary. Pressure testing the cooling system helps identify leak locations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the component.

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the timing chain tensioners can lead to excessive timing chain slack. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially the sprockets. This is often a labor-intensive job.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+

*   **Supercharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger itself can experience failures, including bearing noise, reduced boost pressure, and eventual failure of the unit.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the supercharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+

**Transmission**

**ZF 8HP70 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions within the valve body can cause harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, and even complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. In some cases, flashing the transmission control module (TCM) with updated software may resolve minor issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can manifest as shuddering during acceleration, unusual noises (whining or rattling) from the transmission area, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. This often involves removing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor can fail, leading to the vehicle sitting low on its suspension, uneven ride height, and "Suspension Fault" warnings on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor. It's often recommended to replace the relay as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1500+

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air struts can develop leaks, causing the vehicle to sag, particularly overnight. Leaks are often found at the strut bladder.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per strut (depending on location and new vs. remanufactured).

*   **Height Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of a height sensor causes inaccurate readings to the suspension ECU. This could lead to uneven ride height or the suspension not operating correctly.
    *   Solution: Replace the height sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can lead to a dead battery, especially after the vehicle sits for a few days. This can be caused by a faulty module not shutting down properly or a parasitic draw from an aftermarket accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the battery drain. This often involves using a multimeter to identify which circuit is drawing excessive current.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the source of the draw.

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators can fail, causing the doors to not lock or unlock properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per door.

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The tailgate latch mechanism can fail, making it difficult or impossible to open or close the tailgate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the tailgate latch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can malfunction, causing it to become stuck, operate erratically, or leak.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+

**Summary**

The 2014 Land Rover LR4 offers a unique blend of luxury and off-road capability, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems such as coolant leaks and timing chain tensioner failure can be expensive to fix. The air suspension system is also prone to issues, including compressor failure and air strut leaks. Electrical problems, such as battery drain, can also be a source of frustration. Before purchasing a used 2014 LR4, a thorough inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the severity.
