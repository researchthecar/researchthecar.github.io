The 2005 Land Rover LR3 (also known as the Discovery 3 in some markets) is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its off-road capability and comfortable ride. It came with two engine options: a 4.4L V8 engine that produces 300 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque and a 4.0L V6 engine that produces 216 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a ZF 6HP26 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the LR3 for its spacious interior, advanced terrain response system, and distinctive styling. Common dislikes include the high maintenance costs, complexity of the vehicle's systems, and relatively poor fuel economy.
