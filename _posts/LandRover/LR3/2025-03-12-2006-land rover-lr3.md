The 2006 Land Rover LR3, also known as the Discovery 3 in some markets, is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its off-road capability and spacious interior. It was available with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing 216 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.4L V8 generating 300 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the LR3's off-road prowess, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. However, potential drawbacks include high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and relatively poor fuel economy.
