The 2008 Land Rover LR3, also known as the Discovery 3 in some markets, is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its off-road capabilities and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing 216 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 4.4L V8 generating 300 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the LR3's blend of luxury, off-road prowess, and spacious interior. However, common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs, electrical issues, and the reliability of certain components.

**Engine**

    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's suspension behaves erratically, may display incorrect height settings on the dashboard, or give a constant "Suspension Fault" message.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty height sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery frequently drains overnight or after a short period of inactivity. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or component.
    * Solution: Diagnose and identify the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various modules and circuits.

**Summary**

The 2008 Land Rover LR3 offers a unique blend of luxury and off-road capability, but it is prone to a number of common issues that can be costly to repair. Engine problems such as timing chain tensioner failure and coolant leaks are prevalent, particularly in the 4.4L V8. Transmission issues, especially valve body problems, can also lead to significant repair expenses. The air suspension system is known for its complexity and potential for failure, with compressor and strut replacements being common occurrences. Electrical issues, ranging from battery drain to central junction box problems, further contribute to the ownership costs. While some repairs may be relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission overhauls, can quickly escalate into several thousand dollars. Owners should be prepared for potentially high maintenance costs when considering a 2008 Land Rover LR3.
