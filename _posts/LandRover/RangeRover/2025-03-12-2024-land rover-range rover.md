The 2024 Land Rover Range Rover represents the pinnacle of luxury SUVs, offering a blend of opulent comfort, off-road capability, and advanced technology. Engine options for the 2024 Range Rover are diverse, catering to a range of performance preferences. These include a 3.0-liter inline-six mild-hybrid (MHEV) producing 395 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque, a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 generating 523 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque, and a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) variant combining the inline-six with an electric motor for a combined output of 434 horsepower. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Range Rover's luxurious interior, commanding presence, and off-road prowess. However, some common dislikes include the vehicle's high price tag, complex infotainment system, and historically questionable reliability record.

**Summary**

The 2024 Land Rover Range Rover, while luxurious and capable, appears to have some common issues. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and battery drain are frequently reported. Suspension issues, particularly related to the air suspension system, can be costly to repair. While the 3.0-liter inline-six MHEV seems to be relatively problem-free, the 4.4-liter V8 may experience excessive oil consumption. Transmission problems, although less common, can also lead to significant repair bills. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, making it crucial for potential buyers to conduct thorough research and consider an extended warranty for added protection.
