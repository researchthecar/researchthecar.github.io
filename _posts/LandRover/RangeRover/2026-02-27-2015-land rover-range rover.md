### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Land Rover Range Rover, while offering a luxurious and capable driving experience, presents some common technical reliability concerns. The most frequently reported issues revolve around the air suspension system, with leaks in air springs and compressor failures being notable. Engine-related problems, particularly coolant leaks and timing chain wear on both the V6 and V8 supercharged variants, also require attention. The 8-speed automatic transmission can experience fluid leaks or mechatronic unit issues.
