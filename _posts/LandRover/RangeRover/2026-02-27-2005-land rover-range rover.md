# 2005 Land Rover Range Rover

### Overview
The 2005 Land Rover Range Rover, a luxury SUV known for its off-road prowess and opulent interior, presents a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. While it offers a commanding presence and impressive capabilities, certain model years and specific components are more prone to issues than others. Owners often report a higher incidence of electrical gremlins and suspension-related problems, which can be costly to repair. The powertrain, particularly the V8 engines, can be robust if well-maintained, but age and mileage can lead to specific component failures. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential pitfalls and factor in potential maintenance costs.

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Land Rover Range Rover is a capable luxury SUV, but its complexity and age mean potential buyers should be prepared for maintenance. The most common and costly issues tend to revolve around the adaptive air suspension system, electrical components (especially the BCM and window regulators), and potential engine gasket failures on the BMW-sourced V8. While the supercharged V8 offers more power, it introduces its own set of potential issues. Regular and thorough maintenance is crucial to mitigating these risks. Despite these potential drawbacks, for those who prioritize luxury and off-road capability, and are willing to invest in upkeep, the 2005 Range Rover can still be a rewarding vehicle.
