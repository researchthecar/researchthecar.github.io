*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common occurrence, often stemming from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the location of the leak and shop rates.

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cooling system is prone to leaks and failures. Common issues include cracked expansion tanks, leaking radiator hoses, and water pump failure. Overheating is a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty components, ensuring proper coolant mixture, and regularly inspecting the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component.

*   **VANOS Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Valve Timing (VANOS) system on the M62 engine can experience issues with solenoids or seals, leading to rough idling, decreased performance, and fault codes.
