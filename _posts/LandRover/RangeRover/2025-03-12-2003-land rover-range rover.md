The 2003 Land Rover Range Rover marked a significant shift in the model's design and technology, representing the third generation (L322). It was offered with a BMW-sourced 4.4-liter V8 engine producing 282 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Later in the model year, Land Rover switched to a Jaguar-sourced 4.4-liter V8 engine producing 290 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Range Rover for its off-road capabilities, luxurious interior, and iconic design. However, they commonly dislike its complex electronics, high maintenance costs, and poor fuel economy.
