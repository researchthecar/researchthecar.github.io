### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Land Rover Range Rover is a capable luxury SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of its specific reliability concerns. The V8 engines, particularly the Jaguar-derived 4.4L, can be prone to timing chain issues and cooling system problems. The automatic transmission, while generally robust, can experience issues with the mechatronic unit and torque converter. The adaptive air suspension is a common source of problems, with leaks in air springs and sensor malfunctions being frequent. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drains and infotainment system glitches, are also noted. Interior components like HVAC blend doors can fail. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the Range Rover's luxury and off-road prowess worth the investment in maintenance.
