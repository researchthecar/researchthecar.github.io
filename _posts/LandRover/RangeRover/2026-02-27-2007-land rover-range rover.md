### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Land Rover Range Rover, while a capable and luxurious vehicle, presents several potential reliability concerns that owners should be aware of. The V8 engines, particularly the 4.4L, are susceptible to timing chain issues, and cooling system leaks are common across both engine variants. The automatic transmission can suffer from mechatronic unit or torque converter problems. The adaptive air suspension is a frequent source of issues, with leaks in air springs and sensor malfunctions being prevalent. Electrical gremlins, including battery drain and infotainment glitches, are also reported.
