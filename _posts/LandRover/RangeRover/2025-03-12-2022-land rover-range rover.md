**Summary**

The 2022 Land Rover Range Rover, while luxurious and capable, appears to exhibit issues with its electrical systems, suspension, and drivetrain. The infotainment system, mild-hybrid battery, and air suspension are potential high-cost areas of concern. The ZF 8-speed transmission may also require attention. While not every vehicle experiences these problems, the frequency of reports suggests that potential buyers should be aware of these possibilities and consider extended warranty options.
