**Engine**

**3.0L Inline-6 Mild Hybrid**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often originating from the oil filter housing or valve cover gaskets.  Visible oil spots under the vehicle, low oil level warning light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty gaskets or seals.  In some cases, the entire oil filter housing may need replacement if warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L Supercharged V8**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold.  Potential for complete engine failure if the tensioners fail completely, causing timing chain slippage and valve damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioners, chains, and guides.  A complete engine overhaul may be necessary if significant damage has occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks often stem from the plastic coolant crossover pipe located under the supercharger. This pipe can become brittle with age and exposure to heat, leading to cracks and leaks. Symptoms include a sweet coolant smell, visible coolant puddles under the vehicle, and frequent need to top off coolant levels.
    * Solution: The most common solution is to replace the plastic crossover pipe with an updated metal version. This provides a more durable and reliable alternative that can withstand the engine's operating temperatures. During the repair, it's also advisable to inspect other cooling system components, such as hoses and clamps, for any signs of wear or damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Rough or jerky shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds.  Hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution:  Software update to the transmission control module (TCM).  In some cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Software Update) - $2,000+ (Valve Body)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable vibration or shudder, especially at highway speeds under light acceleration. This is often caused by the torque converter clutch failing to lock up smoothly.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with updated fluid designed to mitigate shudder. In severe cases, torque converter replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, particularly overnight or after the vehicle has been parked for an extended period. The vehicle may lean to one side, and the air suspension compressor may run excessively to compensate for the leak.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking air strut is the most common solution. It's recommended to replace struts in pairs to ensure balanced suspension performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000-$2,000+ per strut
    * Recalls: None Found
