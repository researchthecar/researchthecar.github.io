### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Land Rover Range Rover is a vehicle that demands attentive ownership. Its V8 engines are generally robust but prone to common issues like head gasket failures and oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. The sophisticated air suspension system, while providing excellent comfort and capability, is a frequent source of problems, with leaks and compressor failures being common. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or wiring, are also a significant concern. While the interior offers luxury, wear on leather and HVAC issues can arise. Prospective buyers should budget for ongoing maintenance and potential repairs, especially concerning the suspension and electrical systems.
