### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Land Rover Range Rover offers a luxurious and capable driving experience. However, potential buyers and owners should be aware of certain reliability concerns. The 5.0L V8 engines, both naturally aspirated and supercharged, are prone to timing chain tensioner issues, which can be costly to repair. The adaptive air suspension, while providing excellent comfort, can develop leaks in air springs or sensor malfunctions. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Transmission issues, though less common, can involve fluid leaks or mechatronic unit problems. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, specific components like HVAC blower motors and power seat mechanisms can fail. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining this premium SUV.
