Common complaints include high maintenance costs, poor fuel economy, and electrical gremlins.

**Engine**

**5.0L Naturally Aspirated V8**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. This is due to worn or failed timing chain tensioners, leading to slack in the timing chain. If left unresolved, it can cause significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioners, guides, and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant leaks around the engine. Common leak points include the water pump, radiator, and coolant hoses.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the leak and replacement of the affected component(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on the location and part)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L Supercharged V8**

*   **Supercharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the supercharger, loss of power, and potential supercharger failure. The supercharger snout bearing is a common failure point.
    *   Solution: Supercharger rebuild or replacement. Replacing the snout bearing if the damage isn't extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether a rebuild or replacement is chosen)

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or failure to shift at all. The valve body contains solenoids and valves that control fluid flow, and wear or failure of these components can cause transmission problems.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
