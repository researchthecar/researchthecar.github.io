The 2011 Land Rover Defender is a rugged and iconic off-road vehicle celebrated for its robust build quality, go-anywhere capability, and classic design. It's a vehicle that appeals to enthusiasts seeking a utilitarian and durable machine. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. The 2011 Defender was primarily equipped with a 2.4-liter inline-4 turbodiesel engine (also known as the Puma engine or Duratorq) producing around 120 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. People often admire the Defender for its off-road prowess and distinctive style, but some dislike its relatively agricultural driving experience, lack of modern amenities, and potential for maintenance issues.
