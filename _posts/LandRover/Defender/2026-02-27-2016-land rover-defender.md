### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Land Rover Defender is a robust vehicle with a generally reliable mechanical core. The 2.2L Duratorq diesel engine and the 6-speed manual transmission are known for their durability, though specific components like the EGR valve and turbocharger can require attention. Suspension components, particularly coil springs and shock absorbers, are subject to wear due to the vehicle's off-road nature. Electrical gremlins, often related to wiring harness corrosion, and exterior corrosion are common concerns for older models. Interior wear, especially on seats and HVAC components, is also noted. Despite these potential issues, the Defender's overall mechanical resilience remains a strong point for enthusiasts and off-roaders.
