The 2015 Land Rover Defender, a rugged and iconic off-roader, marked the final year of production for this legendary model in its original form. Available primarily with a 2.2-liter turbodiesel four-cylinder engine, it produced around 120 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. The Defender was lauded for its unparalleled off-road capability, simple mechanicals (relatively speaking), and distinctive, utilitarian design. However, its agricultural roots also meant compromises in on-road comfort, refinement, and reliability, which are frequent criticisms. The vehicle's charm and ruggedness attract enthusiasts, while others are put off by the dated design and potential maintenance challenges. The vehicle was only available with a six-speed manual transmission.
