### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Land Rover Defender, while a capable and durable vehicle, exhibits some common reliability concerns primarily related to its powertrain and body integrity under demanding conditions. The 2.2L Duratorq TDCi engine can experience issues with the turbocharger, EGR valve, and glow plugs. The manual transmission, while robust, can develop bearing wear and clutch issues. Suspension components like springs and shock absorbers are also noted for potential wear and failure. Electrical gremlins, particularly with wiring harnesses and central locking, can arise. Exterior corrosion is a significant concern for Defenders, especially in certain climates, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor can fail. Despite these points, many issues are well-documented and repairable, reflecting the vehicle's age and intended rugged use.
