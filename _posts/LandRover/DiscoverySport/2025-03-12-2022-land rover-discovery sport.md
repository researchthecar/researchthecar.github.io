The 2022 Land Rover Discovery Sport is a compact luxury SUV that attempts to blend off-road capability with on-road comfort. For the 2022 model year, it was offered with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, producing 246 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. People appreciate the Discovery Sport's stylish design, available technology, and relative off-road prowess compared to competitors. However, some criticisms include its sluggish acceleration, occasionally clunky transmission, and potential for unreliability.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (P250)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes, requiring frequent top-ups. This can manifest as a low oil warning light or noticeable drop in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection to check for leaks or internal engine issues (such as piston ring problems) is necessary. This may involve an oil consumption test and potential engine component replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A small number of owners have reported coolant leaks. Symptoms can include a low coolant warning light, visible coolant on the ground after parking, or an unusual sweet smell from the engine compartment.
    *   Solution: A coolant leak requires immediate attention to prevent engine overheating. The source of the leak must be identified and the faulty component replaced. Common leak points include hoses, the water pump, radiator, and coolant reservoir.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1200+ (depending on location and part needing to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hesitation during acceleration, particularly when shifting between lower gears. Rough or jerky shifts can also occur.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can improve shift quality. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection may be required to check for worn or damaged transmission components, such as valve body issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (for software update) - $3000+ (for valve body repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (Touch Pro Duo) can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may require a system reset to restore functionality.
    *   Solution: Check for available software updates for the infotainment system. Applying the latest software can often resolve glitches and improve system stability. In some cases, a complete system reboot or replacement of the infotainment unit might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1500+ (for unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with various sensors, such as parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, or adaptive cruise control. These malfunctions can result in warning lights, error messages, or impaired functionality of the affected systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a diagnostic scanner is required to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor is typically the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+ (depending on the sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Tailgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occasional failures of the power tailgate to open or close correctly. May be accompanied by error messages.
    *   Solution: Check for obstructions that might be preventing the tailgate from operating. If no obstructions are present, the tailgate motor, latch mechanism, or associated wiring may need to be inspected and repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the faulty component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted excessive rattling or squeaking noises coming from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or seats.
    * Solution: The source of the noise needs to be identified and addressed. This may involve tightening loose trim pieces, applying lubrication to contact points, or replacing worn components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on location and extent of the issue)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Land Rover Discovery Sport, while offering a stylish and capable package, has some potential problem areas. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and coolant leaks can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues, such as rough shifting, can affect the driving experience. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and sensors are also relatively common. Interior rattles, while not critical, can detract from the vehicle's luxury feel. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, making a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic highly recommended.
