The 2015 Land Rover Discovery Sport marked a significant entry into the compact luxury SUV market for Land Rover. It offered a blend of off-road capability and on-road comfort, appealing to buyers seeking a versatile vehicle. The 2015 Discovery Sport was primarily equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 240 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Discovery Sport's stylish design, off-road prowess (for its class), and comfortable interior. Common complaints revolve around reliability issues, relatively high maintenance costs, and occasional sluggishness of the 9-speed transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled services. This can sometimes be accompanied by blue exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: The initial step is often to monitor oil consumption closely, document usage, and check for any visible leaks. If consumption is deemed excessive, the dealer may perform an oil consumption test. Depending on the results, possible repairs could include replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or stretching of the timing chain, resulting in rattling noises, especially during cold starts. In severe cases, this can lead to engine misfires and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. It is critical to address this issue promptly to prevent further engine damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
