The 2023 Land Rover Discovery Sport is a compact luxury SUV known for its off-road capability and stylish design. It's powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 246 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. While owners appreciate its refined interior, comfortable ride, and available third-row seating, common criticisms often include its relatively poor fuel economy, some reliability concerns, and the infotainment system can be slow to respond at times. Some potential owners also feel that it lacks the cargo space that other competing vehicles offer.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (246 hp, 269 lb-ft)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled services. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust upon start-up may also be present.
    *   Solution: A software update may be available for the engine control unit (ECU) to address the issue. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection for oil leaks or worn piston rings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) to $1,500 - $4,000+ (for internal engine repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty High-Pressure Fuel Pump**
    * Description/Symptoms: Stalling, rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and a check engine light. The cause of the light may show lean fuel trims.
    * Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during gear changes can also occur.
    *   Solution: A software update for the transmission control module (TCM) may improve shifting behavior. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush or replacement of faulty solenoids within the transmission may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) to $300 - $600+ (for fluid flush/solenoid replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may sit lower than normal, especially on one side. The air suspension warning light may illuminate. The compressor may be excessively noisy or fail to operate entirely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor. It is also recommended to inspect and repair any leaks in the air lines or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update for the infotainment system may resolve the issue. In some cases, a system reset or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) to $500 - $1,500+ (for unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery may drain quickly, especially if left unused for an extended period. This can result in difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of parasitic drain and repair. This may involve replacing the battery, identifying and repairing faulty electrical components, or performing a software update.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks (Sunroof/Panoramic Roof)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, often noticeable after heavy rain. Stains on the headliner or damp carpets may be present.
    *   Solution: Inspection and cleaning of sunroof/panoramic roof drain tubes. Repair or replacement of damaged seals may also be necessary.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Malfunctioning Power Windows**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate properly, either sticking, moving slowly, or failing to respond to the switch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected window motor or regulator. Inspection and repair of wiring or switch issues may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Land Rover Discovery Sport presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. While many owners enjoy its features and capabilities, common issues like excessive oil consumption, transmission roughness, and electrical glitches (especially with the infotainment system) can be a source of frustration. The cost of repairs can vary significantly, from relatively inexpensive software updates to more substantial engine or suspension work. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider obtaining an extended warranty or thoroughly inspecting the vehicle before purchase.
