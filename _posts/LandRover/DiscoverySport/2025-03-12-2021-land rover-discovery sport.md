The 2021 Land Rover Discovery Sport is a compact luxury SUV known for its off-road capabilities and stylish design. It offers a blend of comfort and practicality, with available third-row seating, making it a unique option in its class. Many owners appreciate its distinctive Land Rover styling, interior features, and all-terrain performance. However, some criticisms include a higher price point compared to competitors, a somewhat cramped third row (if equipped), and reliability concerns. For the 2021 model year, the Discovery Sport was primarily equipped with a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 246 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission.
