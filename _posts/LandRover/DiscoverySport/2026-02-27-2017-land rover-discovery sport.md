### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Land Rover Discovery Sport presents a mixed reliability profile. The Ingenium diesel engines are susceptible to DPF and EGR issues, while the petrol variant can experience coolant leaks. The 9-speed automatic transmission is a common source of complaints, with harsh shifting and slipping being reported. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, also appear. Suspension components like bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, the powertrain and electrical systems require attention. Regular maintenance and prompt addressing of early symptoms are crucial for mitigating potential repair costs and ensuring longevity.
