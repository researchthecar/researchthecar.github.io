The 2024 Land Rover Discovery Sport is a compact SUV known for its blend of on-road refinement and off-road capability. It's powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 246 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. While lauded for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and available third-row seating, some owners have expressed concerns about its reliability, infotainment system responsiveness, and fuel economy. It appeals to buyers seeking a luxurious and versatile SUV, but potential issues should be considered.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil level warning light.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to monitor oil levels closely and add oil as needed. In more severe cases, dealers may perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of oil loss. If deemed excessive, they may recommend replacing piston rings or other engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found
