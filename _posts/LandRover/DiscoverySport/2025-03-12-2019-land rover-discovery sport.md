The 2019 Land Rover Discovery Sport is a compact luxury SUV known for its off-road capability and stylish design. The most common engine option for the 2019 model year in the US market is the 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 gasoline engine, producing 237 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. The 2019 Discovery Sport offers a more refined and contemporary design. What people tend to dislike is the perceived reliability issues. Common complaints revolve around electrical glitches, engine problems, and overall build quality compared to some of its competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (Gasoline)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust could indicate oil burning.
    *   Solution: The solution will likely involve a compression test and a leakdown test to diagnose the location of the oil consumption. Depending on the severity, this may involve replacing piston rings, valve seals, or even the entire engine block if cylinder wear is excessive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the extent of repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature timing chain wear or failure. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup, loss of power, and potentially engine stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially associated components like sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points in the cooling system, including the water pump, hoses, and radiator. Low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant on the ground are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Identify and replace the leaking component (water pump, hose, radiator, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (ZF 9HP48)**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can manifest as hesitation during acceleration or noticeable clunking sounds during gear changes.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update could potentially resolve the issue. However, more severe cases might require valve body replacement or even a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush & software) to $4,000+ (rebuild)
     * Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping is characterized by the engine revving high without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This can occur during acceleration or when climbing hills.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush could help in some cases. Otherwise, replacement or rebuild of the transmission may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush & software) to $4,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.) can lead to clunking noises, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings. In some cases, it may be more cost-effective to replace the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner (depending on the bushing/component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking struts or shocks can result in a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed strut or shock absorber.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per corner (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (touchscreen, navigation, audio) can experience a variety of glitches, including freezing, slow response times, black screens, and Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. However, more serious hardware problems may require replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $2,000+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the vehicle (oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, ABS sensors, etc.) can fail, triggering warning lights on the dashboard and potentially affecting engine performance, braking, or other systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor and replacement of the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor (depending on the type and location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing unexplained battery drain, particularly if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the parasitic draw on the battery. This could involve testing individual circuits and components to pinpoint the source of the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity of the problem)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Tailgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power tailgate may fail to open or close properly, or may make unusual noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the tailgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report problems with the sunroof, including difficulty opening or closing, excessive wind noise, or leaks.
    *   Solution: Depending on the specific issue, the solution may involve adjusting the sunroof mechanism, replacing seals, or replacing the entire sunroof assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Land Rover Discovery Sport, while offering attractive styling and off-road capability, appears to have several potential problem areas. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and timing chain problems can lead to significant repair costs. The 9-speed transmission has also reported some problems with rough shifting or slippage. Electrical problems seem to be a frequent issue reported by owners. While not every vehicle will experience all these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing, and budget for possible future repairs.
