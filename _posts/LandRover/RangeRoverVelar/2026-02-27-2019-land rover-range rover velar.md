### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Range Rover Velar presents a generally solid reliability record, with most reported issues being specific to certain components rather than widespread systemic failures. The Ingenium engines, particularly the gasoline variants, can experience coolant leaks and turbocharger problems, while diesel models may face DPF issues. The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission is robust but can sometimes exhibit shifting anomalies. The adaptive air suspension is a notable area for potential concern, with leaks and compressor failures being the most common complaints. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also reported. Exterior flush door handles have also been a point of failure for some owners. Overall, while not immune to issues, proactive maintenance and addressing early warning signs can mitigate many of these potential problems, allowing owners to enjoy the Velar's luxurious experience.
