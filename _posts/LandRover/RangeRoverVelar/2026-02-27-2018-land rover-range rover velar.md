### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Range Rover Velar presents a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its petrol engines and standard transmission. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the diesel engine's Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) system, especially if the vehicle is primarily used for short journeys. The air suspension system, while offering superior comfort, can be a source of costly repairs if leaks or compressor issues arise. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are not uncommon and often require software updates or resets. Overall, for owners who perform regular maintenance and are mindful of driving conditions for diesel models, the Velar can be a reliable luxury SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific vulnerabilities, especially concerning the DPF and air suspension.
