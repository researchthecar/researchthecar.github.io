The 2019 Land Rover Range Rover Velar is a stylish and luxurious mid-size SUV known for its sleek design, comfortable ride, and off-road capability. It offers a range of engine options, including a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4, a 3.0L supercharged V6, and a 2.0L diesel inline-4. The 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 produces 247 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. The Velar is praised for its eye-catching aesthetics and refined interior, however some owners have reported issues with reliability, particularly with the infotainment system and electrical components. Common complaints include electronic glitches, premature wear of some interior components, and occasional mechanical issues. All engine options are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (P250)**

*   **Coolant Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant levels drop rapidly, requiring frequent top-ups. A sweet smell may be noticeable, and overheating may occur. The source of the leak may be difficult to find without a pressure test.
    *   Solution: Pressure test the cooling system to find the leak. Replace leaking hoses, water pump, or thermostat housing if these are the source of the leak. In some cases, the cylinder head or block may be porous and require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+

**3.0L Supercharged V6 (P380)**

*   **Supercharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine bay, loss of power, and potentially a check engine light. The supercharger may be drawing excessive power.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger or rebuild if possible. Inspect the drive belt and pulleys for wear or damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+

**2.0L Diesel Inline-4**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts between gears, hesitation when accelerating, and potential slipping. The issue may be more apparent when cold.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and refill with the correct specification fluid. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $6,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may sag or sit unevenly, often with one corner lower than the others. A warning light may illuminate on the dashboard. The air suspension compressor may be noisy or not run at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor. Also, inspect the air struts and lines for leaks, and replace them as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to compressor failure, the vehicle will sit low or unevenly. Hissing noises may be heard from the struts, especially when the suspension is adjusting.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,500+ per strut

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes and restarts frequently. Functions such as navigation, audio, and climate control may be affected.
    *   Solution: Try a software update if available. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $3,000+ (unit replacement)

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is parked. The vehicle may struggle to start or require jump-starting.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery. Repair or replace the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights illuminate on the dashboard, indicating issues with systems like ABS, traction control, or parking sensors. The affected systems may not function correctly.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor failure using a diagnostic scanner and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor

**Exterior**

*   **Panoramic Roof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The panoramic roof may leak, fail to open or close properly, or make excessive noise during operation.
    *   Solution: Inspect and lubricate the roof mechanism. Replace any damaged seals or components. If the motor is faulty, replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Creaking/Rattling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying creaking or rattling noises emanate from the center console area, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Disassemble the center console and apply felt tape or foam padding to areas where components are rubbing together. Tighten any loose fasteners.

While it boasts striking aesthetics and a comfortable driving experience, potential reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system, suspension, and engine components, are common. The cost of repairs can vary widely, ranging from relatively minor fixes to substantial expenses for issues like supercharger failure or air suspension problems. The potential for infotainment system glitches and battery drain also contributes to owner frustration. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, as well as ensuring all recalls are addressed.
