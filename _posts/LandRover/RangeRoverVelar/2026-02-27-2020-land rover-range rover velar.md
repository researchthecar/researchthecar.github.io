### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Land Rover Range Rover Velar presents a generally reliable profile, with most reported issues concentrated in specific areas rather than systemic failures. The gasoline engines, particularly the 2.0L turbo, have seen some reports of coolant leaks and turbocharger problems. Diesel variants may encounter DPF issues common to modern diesel technology. The adaptive air suspension is a potential source of costly repairs if leaks or malfunctions occur. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system's responsiveness and occasional battery drain, are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas warrant attention for owners and potential buyers, suggesting that thorough pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance are advisable.
