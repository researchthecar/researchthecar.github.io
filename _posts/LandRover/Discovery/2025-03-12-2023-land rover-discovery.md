The 2023 Land Rover Discovery is a luxury SUV known for its off-road capabilities and spacious interior. It typically comes with a choice of two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 296 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter inline-six cylinder engine with mild hybrid technology producing around 355 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Discovery for its refined ride, advanced technology features, and its ability to handle both on-road and off-road conditions. Some common dislikes include the infotainment system's complexity and potential reliability concerns that are common across the brand.
