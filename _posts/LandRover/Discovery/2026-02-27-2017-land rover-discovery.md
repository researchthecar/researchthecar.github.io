### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Land Rover Discovery offers a compelling blend of luxury and off-road capability. While its core mechanicals, particularly the ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, are generally robust, potential owners should be aware of specific issues that can arise. The diesel engines, especially the 2.0L Ingenium and 3.0L TD6, have seen reports of EGR cooler leaks and DPF regeneration problems, respectively. The sophisticated air suspension system, while providing excellent ride comfort, is also a common source of repair, with leaks and compressor failures being notable. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also documented. Proactive maintenance and awareness of these potential issues can help mitigate unexpected repair costs and ensure a more reliable ownership experience.
