Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2000 Land Rover Discovery Series II, organized by category and including cost estimates where available.

The 2000 Land Rover Discovery Series II is a rugged and capable SUV known for its off-road prowess. It came standard with a 4.0-liter V8 engine producing 188 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. It was only offered with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Discovery's classic styling, robust build, and impressive off-road capabilities. However, it's also known for its reliability issues and high maintenance costs, which are significant downsides for many potential buyers.

**Engine**

**4.0L V8 Engine**

*   **Slipping Cylinder Liners (Top Hat Liners)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original cylinder liners can slip, leading to overheating, coolant loss, and eventual engine failure. This often presents with white smoke from the exhaust, indicating coolant burning in the cylinders.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild with "top hat" cylinder liners that prevent slippage, or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, especially from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal. Visible oil on the engine and under the vehicle are typical symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating is a prevalent problem. Components prone to failure include the radiator, water pump, thermostat, and cooling fan clutch. Coolant leaks are also common.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty components. Regularly flushing the cooling system and using the correct coolant are preventative measures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: MAF sensor failure will cause erratic engine behavior, poor fuel economy, and illuminated check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the MAF sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the shop and parts used.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (ZF 4HP22)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting, rough gear changes, or slipping out of gear.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change might temporarily alleviate the issue. More severe cases require transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially during acceleration, can indicate a failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (SLS - Self-Leveling Suspension)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SLS system, if equipped, is prone to failure. This results in the rear of the vehicle sagging, uneven ride height, and the suspension warning light illuminating. Problems often stem from the air compressor, air springs (bags), and height sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty components. Some owners convert to coil spring suspension for increased reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the affected component. Coil spring conversion can cost $500 - $1000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Worn Ball Joints and Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises, loose steering, and uneven tire wear can result from worn ball joints, tie rod ends, and suspension bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the number of parts replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **"Three Amigos" (ABS, Traction Control, Hill Descent Control Lights)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illumination of the ABS, traction control, and hill descent control lights simultaneously. This is commonly caused by a faulty wheel speed sensor, shuttle valve switch, or ABS modulator.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause using a Land Rover-specific diagnostic tool and replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the affected part.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Central Locking System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system can malfunction, leading to doors not locking or unlocking properly. This can be caused by a faulty door lock actuator or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty actuator or repairing the wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery can drain overnight due to parasitic drain from a faulty electrical component.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic drain and repairing or replacing the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable, depending on the cause. Can range from a simple relay replacement ($50+) to more complex wiring repairs ($200+).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
