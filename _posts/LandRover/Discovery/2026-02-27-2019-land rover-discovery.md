### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Land Rover Discovery presents a generally reliable package, particularly with its petrol V6 and diesel V6 powertrains, and the robust ZF 8-speed automatic transmission. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the sophisticated air suspension system, which can develop leaks or compressor issues, and certain electrical components, notably the infotainment system's software and potential battery drain issues. Diesel variants, especially those with the 2.0L Ingenium engine, may encounter DPF or EGR valve problems, common to many modern diesel vehicles. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, potential buyers should factor in the possibility of maintenance costs associated with these specific systems, especially as the vehicle ages.
