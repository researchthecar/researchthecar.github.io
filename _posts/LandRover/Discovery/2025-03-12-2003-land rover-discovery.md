The 2003 Land Rover Discovery II is a rugged SUV known for its off-road capabilities and distinctive boxy styling. It came standard with a 4.6-liter V8 engine producing 217 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. People appreciate the Discovery's go-anywhere attitude, comfortable ride (when the suspension is working correctly), and classic Land Rover aesthetic. However, it's also known for its reliability issues, particularly with its electrical system and aging components. The Discovery II only had the one engine option and was coupled to a ZF 4HP22 automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

*   **Slipping Cylinder Liners**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, and eventual engine failure. This is due to the cylinder liners in the engine block slipping, causing coolant to leak into the cylinders.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild with top-hat liners, or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the repair method and shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil pressure, indicated by the oil pressure warning light. Can lead to catastrophic engine damage if not addressed immediately.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks, and eventual engine damage. This is due to the high temperatures the engine runs at and many plastic coolant parts becoming brittle over time. The water pump, radiator, hoses, and expansion tank are all common failure points.
    *   Solution: Replacing failing cooling system components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the component and severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft and Lifter Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noises from the engine, especially at idle. Reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft and lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 4HP22 Automatic Transmission**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, delayed or harsh shifting, and general lack of smooth operation. Often caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low fluid.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement, or valve body repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and chosen repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at low speeds. Stalling or difficulty accelerating.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (SLS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging or not maintaining ride height, the air suspension warning light illuminating, and the compressor failing. Can be caused by leaks in the air springs, faulty height sensors, or a failing compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air springs with new ones, replacing the height sensors, replacing the compressor, or converting to a coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially over bumps. Poor handling and steering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints and bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on how many components need replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **"Three Amigos" (ABS, Traction Control, Hill Descent Control Lights)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABS, Traction Control, and Hill Descent Control warning lights all illuminate simultaneously. Often caused by a faulty wheel speed sensor, shuttle valve switch in the ABS modulator, or a failing ABS modulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty wheel speed sensor, replacing the shuttle valve switch, or replacing/rebuilding the ABS modulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system failing to operate, either partially or completely. This can be caused by a faulty door latch, a malfunctioning Body Control Unit (BCU), or wiring issues.
