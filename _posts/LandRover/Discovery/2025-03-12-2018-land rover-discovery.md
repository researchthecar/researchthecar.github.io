The 2018 Land Rover Discovery is a luxury SUV known for its off-road capability, spacious interior, and refined driving experience. It offered two engine options: a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 gasoline engine producing 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter turbocharged diesel V6 engine producing 254 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Discovery's luxurious interior, comfortable ride, and off-road prowess. However, common complaints revolve around its reliability, complex electronics, and relatively high maintenance costs.
