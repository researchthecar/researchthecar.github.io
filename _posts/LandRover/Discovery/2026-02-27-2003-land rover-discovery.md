### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Land Rover Discovery is a vehicle that demands attention to maintenance and potential repairs. While its V8 engines offer power, they are prone to head gasket issues and oil leaks. The automatic transmissions can suffer from solenoid failures, and the air suspension system, a hallmark of the Discovery, is a common source of leaks and compressor problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and wiring, are also frequently reported and can be complex to diagnose. Owners should budget for these potential issues, especially if purchasing a vehicle with higher mileage or an incomplete service history. Despite these challenges, many owners find the Discovery's off-road capability and unique character worth the investment.
