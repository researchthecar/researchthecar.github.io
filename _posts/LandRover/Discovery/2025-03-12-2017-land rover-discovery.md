The 2017 Land Rover Discovery marked a significant redesign for the model, moving to a unibody construction and offering a more modern, luxurious experience. Engine options included a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 producing 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0-liter turbocharged diesel V6 producing 254 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Discovery's off-road capability, comfortable interior, and distinctive styling. Common dislikes include its complex electronics, potential for unreliability, and higher-than-average running costs.
