Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2001 Land Rover Discovery, formatted for your website.

The 2001 Land Rover Discovery Series II is a rugged SUV known for its off-road capabilities and distinctive styling. It came standard with a 4.0L V8 engine producing 185 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission (though the manual is quite rare in the US market). Owners often appreciate its classic Land Rover design, off-road prowess, and solid axle suspension. Common dislikes include its fuel economy, reliability issues, and higher maintenance costs compared to other SUVs.

**Engine**

**4.0L V8**

*   **Slipping Cylinder Liners/Cracked Engine Block (common with early Series II Discoveries)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4.0L V8 is prone to cylinder liner slippage and cracking of the engine block, especially in hotter climates or with neglected cooling systems. Symptoms include overheating, coolant loss, excessive white smoke from the exhaust, and a milky substance under the oil filler cap (evidence of coolant mixing with oil).
    *   Solution: Engine replacement or a full engine rebuild with upgraded cylinder liners (top-hat liners).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+ for engine replacement, $4,000 - $7,000+ for a rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Head Gaskets**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, milky substance under oil filler cap, or external coolant leaks from the head gasket area.
    *   Solution: Head gasket replacement. The cylinder heads should be checked for flatness and cracks before reinstallation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from various areas of the engine, including the valve covers, oil pan gasket, front crankshaft seal, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak. Rear main seal replacement can be significantly more expensive due to labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, rough idling, stalling, and a check engine light with codes related to the MAF sensor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (ZF 4HP22)**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, delayed engagement, harsh or erratic shifting, and a general lack of smooth operation.
    *   Solution: Often caused by worn valve body components or low transmission fluid. A fluid flush and filter change *may* help in early stages, but a valve body rebuild or transmission replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for a flush and filter, $800 - $1500 for a valve body rebuild, $2,500 - $4,000+ for a transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at low speeds or during acceleration.  May also trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.  It's often recommended to also service the transmission at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual (LT77S)**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, imprecise steering, and uneven tire wear.  Commonly affects the radius arm bushings, panhard rod bushings, and sway bar bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on which bushings are replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sagging or Leaking Air Suspension (if equipped – Self Leveling Suspension – SLS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, the air compressor running excessively, and error messages on the dashboard. Leaks often occur at the air springs or compressor.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the leaking air springs, compressor, or air lines. Conversion to coil springs is also a common (and often more reliable) alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per air spring, $500 - $1000+ for the compressor, $800 - $2000+ for a coil spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed or Worn Shocks/Dampers**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll, and longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shocks/dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **"Three Amigos" (ABS, Traction Control, Hill Descent Control Lights)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illumination of the ABS, traction control, and hill descent control warning lights on the dashboard. Often caused by a faulty ABS sensor, shuttle valve switch failure in the ABS modulator, or a faulty wheel speed sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a Land Rover-specific diagnostic tool to pinpoint the faulty component. Repair or replacement of the ABS sensor, shuttle valve switch, or wheel speed sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the affected component and labor. Shuttle valve repair can be more costly.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Central locking system failing to lock or unlock doors, remote key fob not working, or alarm system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the central locking system, including checking the door lock actuators, wiring, and the Body Control Unit (BCU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window failing to go up or down, or making grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window regulator.
