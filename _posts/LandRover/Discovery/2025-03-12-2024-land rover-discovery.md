The 2024 Land Rover Discovery is a luxury SUV known for its off-road capabilities and spacious interior. Engine options include a 296-hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder and a 355-hp 3.0-liter inline-six mild-hybrid. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Discovery's comfortable ride, sophisticated styling, and advanced technology. However, some criticisms include the infotainment system's complexity and potential reliability concerns, which can lead to high repair costs.

**Engine**

**2.0-Liter Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: The most common fix is to replace the piston rings with an updated design, although more severe cases could require a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0-Liter Inline-Six Mild-Hybrid**

*   **Failure of the Mild Hybrid System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mild hybrid system may experience failures, resulting in error codes, reduced engine power, and potential drivability issues. This system uses a 48V electrical system that can have a variety of issues with different components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking the battery, inverter, and connections. Repair involves component replacement, such as the motor-generator unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, especially between lower gears. A clunking noise may also be heard during shifts.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (Software Update) - $5,000+ (Valve Body/Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system may fail, leading to the vehicle sagging on one or more corners or failing to adjust ride height. Error messages related to the suspension system may also appear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the air compressor, air struts, and associated sensors. Replacement of faulty components is necessary to restore proper suspension function.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may experience glitches, such as freezing, slow response times, or random reboots. Connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto may also occur.

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring sensors, or adaptive cruise control sensors, may malfunction, leading to error messages and impaired functionality.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves scanning for error codes and testing the sensors. Replacement of faulty sensors is necessary to restore proper function.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks can occur through the sunroof, door seals, or taillight seals, leading to moisture buildup inside the vehicle.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Land Rover Discovery presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While the engine and transmission can have costly problems like excessive oil consumption and harsh shifting, electrical and suspension issues, such as infotainment glitches and air suspension failures, can also significantly impact ownership. Interior and exterior issues, like trim pieces coming loose and water leaks, add to the list of potential headaches. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for more complex repairs. While the Discovery offers luxury and capability, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering this vehicle.
