The 2002 Land Rover Discovery Series II is a rugged and capable SUV known for its off-road prowess and distinctive styling. It was offered with a single engine option, a 4.0-liter V8 engine producing 185 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate its go-anywhere capability and classic Land Rover design. However, it is also known for its reliability issues and higher maintenance costs compared to other SUVs. Common complaints revolve around electrical problems, cooling system issues, and general wear and tear affecting older vehicles.

**Engine**

**4.0L V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the vehicle and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location of the leak.

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating is a frequent problem due to radiator failure, water pump failure, thermostat malfunction, or clogged coolant passages.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty component(s). Thoroughly flushing and cleaning the cooling system is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the component(s) needing replacement and any additional repairs.

*   **Slipping Cylinder Liners (Top Hat Liners)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original engine design from Land Rover used cylinder liners that could slip, causing engine failure. Symptoms include overheating, coolant loss, and knocking noises.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild with updated "Top Hat" cylinder liners, or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4000 - $8000+ (engine rebuild or replacement)

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit slipping between gears, harsh shifting, or failure to shift properly.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low fluid levels, contaminated fluid, or a failing valve body. A full transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3000+ (rebuild or replacement)

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear air suspension (if equipped) is prone to failure, resulting in a sagging rear end or a suspension that does not maintain the correct ride height. The air compressor may also fail.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air springs, air compressor, or ride height sensors. Conversion to coil springs is a common alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the components replaced and whether a coil spring conversion is performed.

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn bushings in the control arms, sway bar, and other suspension components can lead to sloppy handling, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the number of bushings replaced and the shop's labor rates.

**Electrical**

*   **"Three Amigos" ABS Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "Three Amigos" refers to the simultaneous illumination of the ABS, Traction Control, and Hill Descent Control warning lights. This is often caused by a faulty ABS modulator, wheel speed sensor, or shuttle valve switch.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the underlying cause and replacing the faulty component. The shuttle valve switch is a common culprit and can sometimes be repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (shuttle valve repair) - $1000+ (ABS modulator replacement)

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the central locking system are common, including failure to lock or unlock doors, malfunctioning remote key fobs, and alarm system issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing faulty door lock actuators, remote key fobs, or the Body Control Module (BCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the specific issue and component replaced.

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power window regulators are prone to failure, causing the windows to become stuck in either the up or down position.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is a significant concern, particularly in areas prone to road salt. Common rust locations include the frame, rocker panels, wheel arches, and floor pans.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement. Applying rust prevention measures can help slow down the process.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity of the rust and the extent of the repairs needed.

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner material often detaches from the backing board, causing it to sag.
    *   Solution: Replacing or re-gluing the headliner material.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on whether you DIY or have a professional do the work.

**Summary**

The 2002 Land Rover Discovery Series II presents a mixed bag. While it's a capable off-roader with a distinctive design, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems, particularly oil leaks and cooling system failures, are frequent and can be costly to address. Electrical gremlins and suspension issues also contribute to higher maintenance costs. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major repairs like engine or transmission overhauls. Prospective owners should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, check its service history, and be prepared for potential maintenance expenses.
