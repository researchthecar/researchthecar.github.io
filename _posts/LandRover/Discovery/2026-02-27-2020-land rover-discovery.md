### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Land Rover Discovery presents a generally reliable package, especially considering its complex nature and off-road capabilities. The powertrain options, particularly the ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, have proven robust. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the sophisticated air suspension system, which can develop leaks or compressor issues over time, and the diesel engines' emissions control systems (DPF and AdBlue), which require proper usage and maintenance to avoid clogging or malfunctions. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted but not pervasive. Owners who adhere to recommended maintenance schedules and understand the operational needs of diesel emissions systems can expect a dependable luxury SUV experience.
