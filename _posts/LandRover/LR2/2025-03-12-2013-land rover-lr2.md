The 2013 Land Rover LR2, also known as the Freelander 2 in some markets, is a compact luxury SUV. It was offered with a single engine option in the US market: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 240 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised its off-road capabilities (relative to other compact SUVs), comfortable interior, and distinctive styling. However, some common complaints include higher-than-average running costs, lackluster fuel economy, and a history of reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various locations, including the water pump, thermostat housing, and radiator hoses. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles.
    *   Solution: Identify and replace the leaking component. The water pump is a common culprit and often requires replacing the entire unit, including the housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a fairly common issue. The valve cover gasket and timing cover are known leak points. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, low oil levels, and burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Clean the engine after the repair to monitor for further leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can fail prematurely, leading to reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, and unusual noises (whining or screeching).
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger assembly. Check the oil supply line to the turbo for blockages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Aisin AWF21)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report rough shifting, particularly between certain gears, or hesitation when accelerating. This can manifest as jerky movements or a delay in response.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush. If the problem persists, valve body repair or replacement might be necessary. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and tear of the front lower control arm bushings. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, especially over bumps, and vague steering.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings or the entire lower control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience issues with rapid battery drain, even with the vehicle turned off. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Disconnect aftermarket accessories one by one to determine if one of them is the problem. Address the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as the mass airflow sensor (MAF), oxygen sensors, and ABS sensors, can fail. Symptoms vary depending on the sensor but may include poor engine performance, illuminated check engine light, and ABS malfunction.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that has failed and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system can malfunction, causing doors to lock/unlock erratically or not respond to the key fob.
    *   Solution: Check the key fob battery. Diagnose and repair or replace the affected door lock actuator, or the central locking module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Differential Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear differential can develop leaks around the seals, resulting in fluid loss and potential damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the differential seals. Check and refill the differential fluid level.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof motor can fail or the sunroof mechanism can jam, preventing the sunroof from opening or closing properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the sunroof motor or repair the sunroof mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Land Rover LR2 can be a comfortable and capable compact SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of its potential reliability issues. Engine oil leaks and coolant leaks are common issues. Electrical problems can be tricky to diagnose. While no widespread recalls are affecting this particular model year, the cost of repairing even relatively minor problems can be higher than average due to the vehicle's complexity and the availability of parts. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended before purchasing a used 2013 LR2.
