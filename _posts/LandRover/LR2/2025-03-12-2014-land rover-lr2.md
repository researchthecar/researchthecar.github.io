The 2014 Land Rover LR2 is a compact luxury SUV known for its off-road capabilities and comfortable ride. It was only offered with one engine and transmission option: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 240 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the LR2 for its refined interior, comfortable seats, and sure-footed handling, especially in adverse weather conditions. Criticisms typically include its relatively low fuel economy compared to competitors, less cargo space, and some reports of reliability issues.
