The 2015 Land Rover LR2, also known as the Freelander 2 in some markets, is a compact luxury SUV that offers a blend of off-road capability and on-road comfort. It was only available with a single engine and transmission option in the US market: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 240 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the LR2's refined interior, comfortable ride, and surprising off-road prowess. However, some common complaints include higher than average running costs, relatively poor fuel economy, and the potential for costly repairs as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various locations in the engine, including the water pump, hoses, and thermostat housing. Symptoms include low coolant level, overheating, and visible coolant puddles under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from the valve cover gasket, timing cover, or rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+ depending on the location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) can fail. Symptoms include a loss of power, extended cranking, engine misfires and potentially a no start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the High Pressure Fuel Pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6-speed automatic transmission can exhibit rough or delayed shifting, particularly when cold. This can be due to valve body issues or worn clutch packs.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might improve the condition, but in some cases, valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The suspension bushings, particularly in the front control arms, can wear out prematurely, leading to clunking noises, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the problem.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and ABS sensors, can fail, triggering warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor, depending on location and type.
