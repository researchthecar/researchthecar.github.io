**Summary**

The 2012 Land Rover LR2 presents a mixed bag for owners. While it offers a comfortable and capable driving experience, it's prone to certain mechanical and electrical issues that can lead to costly repairs. Engine problems, particularly with the HPFP and coolant leaks, are common, as are transmission issues related to the torque converter. Suspension and electrical problems also contribute to the overall cost of ownership. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in the potential for higher-than-average maintenance costs when considering this vehicle. Pre-purchase inspections and thorough maintenance records are highly recommended. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, resulting in repair costs from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
