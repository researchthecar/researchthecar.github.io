The 2009 Land Rover LR2 is a compact SUV that offered a blend of off-road capability and on-road comfort. This model year came with only one engine option: a 3.2-liter inline-6 engine producing 230 horsepower and 234 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the LR2 for its comfortable ride, decent handling, and off-road prowess for its class. However, some common complaints included relatively poor fuel economy, some reliability issues, and higher maintenance costs compared to other SUVs in its segment.

**Engine**

**3.2L Inline-6**

*   **Thermostat Housing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The thermostat housing, often made of plastic, can crack or warp, leading to coolant leaks. Symptoms include a low coolant level warning, overheating, and visible coolant leaks near the thermostat housing.
    *   Solution: Replace the thermostat housing with an updated design, preferably one made of a more durable material such as aluminum.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty VVT solenoids can cause rough idling, decreased engine performance, poor fuel economy, and the check engine light to illuminate with codes related to the VVT system.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty VVT solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per solenoid (depending on location and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Housing Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The gasket between the oil filter housing and the engine block can deteriorate over time, leading to oil leaks. This can cause low oil pressure, oil consumption, and visible oil leaks on the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil filter housing gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin Warner AWF21 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body controls the flow of hydraulic fluid within the transmission. Wear and tear or contamination can lead to valve body malfunctions. Symptoms include harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, and potentially complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: In some cases, cleaning and rebuilding the valve body with new solenoids can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, a complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve body rebuild: $500 - $1500+. Transmission Replacement: $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter allows the engine to keep running when the vehicle is stopped, and it multiplies engine torque to help the vehicle accelerate. A failing torque converter can cause shuddering during acceleration, stalling, poor fuel economy, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. This often requires removing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning. They can also lead to vague steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the front lower control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushing replacement: $200 - $400+. Control arm replacement: $400 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension bushings can wear causing clunking noises and excessive movement in the rear. This leads to poor handling and instability at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: Replace worn bushings, arms, or any other damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working or become slow and erratic in their movement. This is often caused by a faulty window regulator motor or a damaged cable within the regulator assembly.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window regulator assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system may fail to lock or unlock the doors, or it may operate intermittently. This can be due to a faulty door lock actuator, a problem with the remote key fob, or an issue with the central locking control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause of the problem and replace the faulty component, such as a door lock actuator or the central locking control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Door lock actuator: $200 - $400+ per door. Control Module: $300-$800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may leak, fail to open or close properly, or make excessive noise during operation. This is often due to clogged drain tubes, a faulty motor, or damaged tracks.
    *   Solution: Clean the drain tubes, repair or replace the sunroof motor, or repair or replace the sunroof tracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Drain cleaning: $100 - $200. Motor replacement: $300 - $600+. Track repair/replacement: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Heater Core Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heater core can leak coolant, causing a sweet smell inside the cabin, fogging of the windows, and a loss of coolant.
    *   Solution: Replace the heater core. This is a labor-intensive job as the dashboard must be removed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor resistor controls the speed of the HVAC blower fan. When it fails, the blower fan may only work on certain speeds or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Land Rover LR2, while offering some attractive features, is prone to several common issues. Engine and transmission problems can be costly to repair, and suspension and electrical faults add to the potential maintenance burden. The thermostat housing and valve body issues are particularly noteworthy due to their potential for significant expense. While some problems are relatively minor, the cumulative cost of addressing these issues can be substantial, making thorough pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance essential for prospective owners.
