### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Land Rover LR2 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain is generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues with the engine's timing chain and oil seals, particularly on higher mileage examples. Transmission can sometimes exhibit shifting problems. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and various sensors, are not uncommon. Exterior issues like sunroof leaks can lead to interior water damage if not addressed promptly. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor resistor are also known failure points. Despite these potential drawbacks, many LR2s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and timely repairs of reported issues.
