### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Land Rover LR2 presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanical components like the engine and transmission are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues related to cooling system leaks and timing chain wear on the 3.2L engine, and turbocharger concerns on the 2.0L variant. Transmission fluid leaks and harsh shifting can also occur. Suspension components, particularly strut mounts and control arm bushings, may require attention over time. Electrical issues like headlight ballasts and power window regulators are not uncommon. Proactive maintenance, especially regarding fluid levels and timely replacement of worn parts, is crucial for maximizing the longevity and reliability of the 2012 LR2.
