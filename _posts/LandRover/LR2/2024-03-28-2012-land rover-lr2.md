**2012 Land Rover LR2 Overview**

The 2012 Land Rover LR2 is a compact luxury SUV that slots beneath the larger Range Rover Sport in the automaker's lineup. It's powered by a 3.2-liter V6 engine producing 230 horsepower and 234 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The LR2 boasts a rugged exterior and premium interior, but it's not without its share of problems.

**Engine**

**3.2L V6**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on cold starts. The tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to skip or break, resulting in catastrophic engine damage. Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner and guides. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **VVT Solenoid Failure:** The variable valve timing (VVT) solenoid can fail, leading to reduced engine performance, rough idling, and increased emissions. Solution: Replace the VVT solenoid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift Solenoid Pack Failure:** The shift solenoid pack controls the transmission's gear selection. A faulty solenoid pack can cause rough shifting, delayed shifts, or the transmission to get stuck in gear. Solution: Replace the shift solenoid pack. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Wear:** The rubber bushings in the front lower control arms can wear out prematurely, leading to clunking noises over bumps and uneven tire wear. Solution: Replace the control arm bushings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Several electrical components can drain the battery prematurely, including the audio system, climate control system, and interior lights. Solution: Inspect and repair or replace any faulty components. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the source of the drain
* **Headlight Switch Failure:** The headlight switch can fail, resulting in intermittent or inoperable headlights. Solution: Replace the headlight switch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $700+

**Exterior**

* **Rear Bumper Cover Loose:** The rear bumper cover can become loose, especially after being hit or bumped. Solution: Realign and secure the bumper cover. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Panel Cracking:** The dashboard panel can develop cracks or deform over time. Solution: Replace the dashboard panel. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Center Console Trim Peeling:** The trim on the center console can peel off or lose its adhesion. Solution: Replace the center console trim. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Summary**

The 2012 Land Rover LR2 is a capable SUV with a luxurious interior, but it has its fair share of reliability issues. The engine and transmission are the most problematic areas, with potential for expensive repairs. While some of the other issues are more minor, they can still be frustrating and detract from the overall ownership experience.
