### Summary Verdict
The 2024 Land Rover Defender 90 demonstrates a strong initial reliability profile, particularly with its standard coil spring suspension and the P300 engine. The more complex P400 mild-hybrid system and the optional Adaptive Air Suspension are the primary areas where potential issues have been noted, ranging from mild hybrid component malfunctions to air suspension leaks or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment software, are also a possibility. Owners of V8 models should be aware of potential coolant leaks. Overall, while not immune to the complexities of modern automotive technology, the Defender 90 appears to be a well-built vehicle, with most reported issues being manageable and not indicative of systemic failure across the board.
