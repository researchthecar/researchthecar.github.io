### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Land Rover Defender 90 demonstrates a commendable level of reliability for its debut model year, particularly in its core powertrain and chassis components. The Ingenium engines and the ZF 8-speed automatic transmission have not shown significant widespread issues. However, potential owners should be aware of isolated reports concerning the electronic air suspension, specifically the air compressor, and some electrical gremlins related to the infotainment system's software and intermittent battery drain. These issues, while not pervasive, represent the most common technical concerns documented. Overall, the Defender 90 offers a robust platform with a generally positive reliability outlook, provided these specific areas are monitored or addressed if they arise.
