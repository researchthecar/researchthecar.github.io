The 2021 Land Rover Defender 110 marked a significant redesign, blending classic design cues with modern technology and off-road capability. Engine options for the 2021 Defender 110 included a 2.0L P300 Turbocharged Inline-4 (296 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L P400 Turbocharged Inline-6 MHEV (395 hp, 406 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.0L P525 Supercharged V8 (518 hp, 461 lb-ft of torque).

However, common complaints include electrical glitches, infotainment system issues, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2021 Land Rover Defender 110 presents a mixed bag of owner experiences. While lauded for its design and off-road capabilities, it faces notable issues, particularly in the electrical and suspension systems. Infotainment glitches and air suspension problems appear to be fairly common and can lead to significant repair costs. The 3.0L inline-6 MHEV engine has also faced issues related to the mild hybrid system. While engine and transmission problems aren't as widely reported as electrical or suspension issues, potential buyers should be aware of the possibility of costly repairs, particularly if the transmission exhibits shifting problems. Overall, thorough inspection and a comprehensive pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended for potential buyers of this vehicle.
