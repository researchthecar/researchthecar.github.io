### Summary Verdict
The 2023 Land Rover Defender 110 demonstrates a generally strong reliability record, particularly with its core powertrain components like the 2.0L turbo-four and the 8-speed automatic transmission. The more complex systems, such as the electronic air suspension and the mild-hybrid system in the P400 engine, present the most common areas for potential issues, including leaks and electrical glitches. Infotainment software can also be prone to occasional bugs requiring updates. While the V8 engine has not shown widespread mechanical faults, its performance-oriented nature may lead to higher running costs. Overall, the Defender 110 is a robust vehicle, but owners opting for advanced features like air suspension should be aware of potential repair costs associated with these systems.
