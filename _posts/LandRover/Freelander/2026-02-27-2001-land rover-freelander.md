### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Land Rover Freelander presents a mixed reliability picture. While its off-road prowess and distinctive styling are appealing, potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the K-Series petrol engines (head gasket failures) and the automatic transmission. The diesel engines generally offer better long-term durability but can suffer from turbocharger or injector problems. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and ABS faults, are also frequently reported. The VCU in the 4WD system is a known weak point. Despite these potential drawbacks, diligent maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble can help manage ownership costs. It's a vehicle that requires a commitment to upkeep to ensure continued serviceability.
