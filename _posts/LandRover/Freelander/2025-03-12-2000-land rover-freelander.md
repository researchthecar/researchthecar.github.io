Diesel engines have issues as well with turbo failures and fuel injectors. Suspension issues are also common, and electrical problems can add to the frustration. The cost of repairs can quickly escalate, making it an expensive vehicle to maintain. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and carefully inspect any used Freelander before purchasing.
