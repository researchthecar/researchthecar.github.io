The 2004 Land Rover Freelander was a compact SUV known for its off-road capabilities and Land Rover heritage, despite its smaller size and more affordable price point compared to other models in the Land Rover lineup. The North American market received the Freelander with a 2.5L V6 engine producing 174 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Globally, other engine options existed, including a 1.8L I4 gasoline engine and a 2.0L I4 diesel engine, but these were not available in North America for the 2004 model year. Owners often appreciated its maneuverability, decent fuel economy for an SUV of its type, and available features like a sunroof and leather interior. However, the Freelander was also criticized for its reliability issues, high maintenance costs, and less refined interior compared to other Land Rovers.
