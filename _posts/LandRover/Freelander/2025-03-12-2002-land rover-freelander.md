The 2002 Land Rover Freelander was a compact SUV offering a blend of Land Rover's off-road heritage in a more accessible package. In North America, the primary engine option was a 2.5-liter V6 engine producing around 174 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. A 5-speed manual transmission was available in other markets, but not in North America for the 2002 model year. Owners appreciated the Freelander's distinctive styling, relatively compact size, and available off-road capabilities. Common dislikes included perceived unreliability, higher maintenance costs compared to competitors, and the complexity of the vehicle's systems.
