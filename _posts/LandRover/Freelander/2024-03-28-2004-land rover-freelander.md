**Summary:**

The 2004 Land Rover Freelander has a number of potential issues, particularly with the engine (intake manifold gasket failure and timing chain tensioner failure). Transmission issues are also common, especially slipping gears with the 5-speed automatic and torque converter shudder with the 6-speed automatic. Other problems include suspension strut mount failure, electrical battery drain and headlight switch failure, sunroof leaks, and climate control system failure. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, with some repairs being relatively minor and inexpensive, while others can be more serious and expensive.
