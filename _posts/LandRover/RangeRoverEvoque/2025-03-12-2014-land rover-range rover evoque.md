**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 2.0L engines consume an excessive amount of oil between changes, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored closely. This can manifest as the low oil pressure light illuminating, or hearing unusual engine noises.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and more frequent oil changes might mitigate the issue. In severe cases, a dealer or mechanic might recommend replacing piston rings or other engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity and required repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the timing chain can occur, resulting in a rattling noise from the engine, especially on start-up. If left unaddressed, this can lead to severe engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual whistling or whining noises from the engine, and the check engine light illuminating could indicate a turbocharger issue.
