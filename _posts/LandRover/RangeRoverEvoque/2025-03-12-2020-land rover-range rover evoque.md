The 2020 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque is a compact luxury SUV known for its stylish design, off-road capabilities, and upscale interior. The standard engine for the 2020 model year is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, producing 246 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. Some trims also offer a mild-hybrid (MHEV) version of the same engine, boosting output to 296 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Evoque's distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and technology features. However, some common complaints include reliability issues, a cramped rear seat, and a relatively high price point.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (246 hp / 269 lb-ft)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 2.0L engine consumes an excessive amount of oil between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings, the need to frequently top off the oil, and in severe cases, potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Initially, owners should closely monitor oil levels and top off as needed. A dealer can perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of oil usage. If consumption is deemed excessive, potential solutions include replacing the PCV valve, inspecting for leaks, or, in severe cases, replacing piston rings or the entire engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV valve) - $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Mild-Hybrid Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (296 hp / 295 lb-ft)**
*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough or jerky shifting, especially during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. Some owners have also described hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during gear changes.
    * Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and software update. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be inspected or replaced. In extreme cases, complete transmission replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $1,500 (valve body) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Malfunctions (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with air suspension may experience issues such as the vehicle sagging on one side, the suspension failing to adjust properly, or warning lights illuminating on the dashboard. These problems can be caused by leaks in the air springs, a faulty air compressor, or issues with the suspension control module.
    * Solution: Diagnosis requires a scan tool to identify the faulty component. Depending on the cause, the air springs, air compressor, or control module may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per air spring, $1,000 - $2,500 for compressor replacement, $500 - $1,500 for control module replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Touch Pro Duo infotainment system can be prone to freezing, lagging, or crashing, requiring a restart. Some users have also reported issues with the touchscreen responsiveness.
    * Solution: First, try performing a system reset or software update. If the problem persists, the infotainment module may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software) - $1,500+ (module replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced excessive battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    * Solution: Check for parasitic draws by testing each fuse in the vehicle. If a specific circuit is found to be the cause, trace back to find the malfunctioning component. If not, replace the battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400+ for a new battery. $100-$1000+ for parasitic draw repairs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Automatic Emergency Braking System (AEB) Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: False activation of the AEB system, causing the vehicle to brake unexpectedly even when there are no obstacles present.
    * Solution: A dealer inspection and recalibration of the AEB system are typically required. In some cases, sensors may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced problems with the sunroof, including difficulty opening or closing, unusual noises, or leaks.
    * Solution: Diagnosis may involve inspecting the sunroof tracks, seals, and motor. Depending on the cause, repairs may involve lubricating the tracks, replacing the seals, or replacing the motor or the entire sunroof assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, while stylish and capable, appears to suffer from a number of potential issues. The most concerning relate to the engine and transmission, where excessive oil consumption and harsh shifting can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system, are also relatively common and can be frustrating. Suspension and exterior problems, while less frequent, can still result in significant expenses. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of potential repairs when considering this vehicle. The severity of the issues ranges from relatively minor electrical glitches to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
