**Summary**

The 2017 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque has some documented reliability concerns. The most prevalent issues seem to center around the engine (oil consumption, timing chain), transmission (harsh shifting, potential failure), and electrical systems (infotainment, battery drain). Suspension issues and interior/exterior problems like water leaks and sunroof malfunctions also appear. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely. While some issues can be resolved with software updates or minor repairs, others may require costly component replacements. The Evoque can be an expensive vehicle to maintain, particularly if major engine or transmission repairs are needed. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with Land Rover vehicles.
