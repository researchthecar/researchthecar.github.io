The 2012 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque marked a significant departure for the Range Rover brand, offering a stylish and more compact SUV aimed at a wider audience. The primary engine option was a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 240 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. All models were equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Owners appreciate the Evoque's distinctive design, luxurious interior, and nimble handling. However, common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system, engine, and transmission, as well as higher-than-average maintenance costs.
