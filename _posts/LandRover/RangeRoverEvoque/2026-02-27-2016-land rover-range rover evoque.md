### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Range Rover Evoque presents a mixed reliability profile. While the powertrain is generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues with coolant leaks and turbocharger performance in the 2.0L engine. The 9-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting or leaks, often addressable with software updates or fluid services. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted concerns. Exterior water leaks and interior HVAC issues are less common but can occur. Despite these points, many owners find the Evoque to be a stylish and enjoyable vehicle, with most issues being repairable. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for long-term ownership satisfaction.
