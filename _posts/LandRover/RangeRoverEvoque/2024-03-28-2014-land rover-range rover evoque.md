**2014 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque**

The 2014 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque is a compact luxury SUV that offers a choice of two engines: a 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine with 240 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L supercharged V6 engine with 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.

The Evoque has received positive reviews for its stylish design, luxurious interior, and off-road capabilities. However, it has also been criticized for its high price, cramped rear seats, and poor fuel economy.
