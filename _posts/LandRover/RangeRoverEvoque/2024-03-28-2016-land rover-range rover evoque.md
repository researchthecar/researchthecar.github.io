**Introduction of the Vehicle**
The 2016 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque is a compact luxury SUV that combines rugged off-road capability with sophisticated style. It is powered by a choice of two gasoline engines: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 240 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 with 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The Evoque is praised for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and impressive off-road performance, but it has also been criticized for its high price and limited cargo space.
