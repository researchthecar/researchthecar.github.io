# 2012 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque

### Overview
The 2012 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, while celebrated for its distinctive styling and off-road prowess, presents a mixed reliability picture. As a first-generation model, it carries some of the typical challenges associated with new platforms and complex systems. Owners have reported a range of issues, particularly concerning the powertrain and electronics, which can lead to unexpected repair costs.
