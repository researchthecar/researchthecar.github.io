The 2013 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque is a compact luxury SUV known for its stylish design and off-road capability. For the 2013 model year, it primarily featured a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 240 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Evoque's distinctive looks, upscale interior, and nimble handling. Common dislikes include the somewhat cramped rear seating, the complexity of the infotainment system, and concerns about reliability and repair costs.
