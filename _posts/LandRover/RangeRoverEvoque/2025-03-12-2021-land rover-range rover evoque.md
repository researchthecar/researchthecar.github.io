The 2021 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque is a compact luxury SUV known for its stylish design, off-road capability, and comfortable interior. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 246 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. A mild-hybrid (MHEV) version of the same engine is also available, boosting output to 296 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Evoque's distinctive appearance and upscale features, but some common criticisms include its relatively cramped rear seating, infotainment system quirks, and potential reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (246 hp)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, sometimes as often as every 1,000 miles. This can be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Potential solutions range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive work like piston ring replacement. A leak-down test can help determine the extent of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Mild-Hybrid Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (296 hp)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing rough shifts, particularly when downshifting or accelerating from a stop. This can feel like a "clunk" or "jerk" in the transmission.
    *   Solution: A software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) might resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates or fails to engage when shifting gears. RPMs may increase without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is critical; it could be low transmission fluid, a faulty valve body, or internal component failure. A transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits unevenly, air compressor runs constantly, suspension malfunction warning light illuminates.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty air struts, air compressor, or air lines. Check for leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The touchscreen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or restarts randomly. Navigation, audio, and other features may be affected.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often released to address these issues. A hard reset may provide temporary relief. In some cases, the entire infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the vehicle sits unused for several days. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Faulty modules, improperly installed accessories, or a failing battery can be the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Tailgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power tailgate fails to open or close properly, makes unusual noises, or gets stuck.
    *   Solution: Check the tailgate struts, latch mechanism, and wiring harness. Replacement of faulty components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof or moonroof gets stuck, makes grinding noises, or leaks.
    *   Solution: Inspect the tracks, seals, and motor. Clean and lubricate the tracks, or replace damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Climate Control Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The climate control system blows hot air when it should be cold, or vice versa. The fan may not work properly, or the temperature settings may be inaccurate.
    *   Solution: Check the refrigerant level, blend door actuator, and control module. Repair or replace faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, while stylish and capable, does have some common issues reported by owners. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine (excessive oil consumption), transmission (harsh shifting and slipping), electrical systems (infotainment system problems and battery drain), and suspension. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, ranging from relatively inexpensive software updates to costly engine or transmission repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential pitfalls and consider a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
