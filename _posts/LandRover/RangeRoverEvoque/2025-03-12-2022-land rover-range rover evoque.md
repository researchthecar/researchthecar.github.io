Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2022 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2022 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque is a compact luxury SUV known for its stylish design and off-road capabilities. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 246 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its distinctive styling, luxurious interior, and available technology. However, common complaints include the complex infotainment system, reliability concerns, and relatively small cargo space. While it handles off-road situations adequately for its class, some owners dislike its higher price point for its size and performance compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (246 hp)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-expected oil consumption requiring frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust might be observed in severe cases.
    *   Solution: The first step is often a software update to the ECU designed to improve oil control. If that fails, more invasive diagnostics are required. This may involve compression tests, leak-down tests, and ultimately, potentially replacement of piston rings or even the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$5000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points in the cooling system, including hoses, the water pump, or the coolant reservoir. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty component (hose, water pump, reservoir, etc.). Pressure testing the system helps locate elusive leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the component and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough or delayed shifting, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation upon acceleration is also reported.
    *   Solution: Start with a software update for the transmission control module (TCM). If the problem persists, a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement can be attempted. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (software update) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or non-existent shifts when changing gears. Transmission may fail and require towing. This could also be caused by a software problem.
    * Solution: If this is caused by a software problem, the problem can be fixed with an ECU update. If this is caused by failure, replace transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, particularly overnight, indicates a leak in the air suspension system. Fault codes related to ride height sensors or the air compressor may also appear.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair leaks in air struts, air lines, or the air compressor. Replace faulty ride height sensors or the air compressor as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per corner, depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, including the touchscreen display, may freeze, lag, or crash intermittently. Bluetooth connectivity issues and navigation problems can also occur.
    *   Solution: Start with a software update for the infotainment system. If the problem persists, a hard reset of the system may be required. In severe cases, the infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (infotainment unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery frequently dies, even when the vehicle has not been used in a few days.
    * Solution: Test the battery for dead cells. If the battery is fine, check for parasitic draws. Replace the battery or repair the parasitic draw.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sunroof, unusual noises during operation, or leaks.
    *   Solution: Inspect and lubricate the sunroof tracks and seals. Repair or replace damaged components, such as the motor or guide cables.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Malfunctioning Power Windows/Locks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate properly or at all. Power locks failing to lock/unlock doors.
    *   Solution: Replace window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque can suffer from a variety of issues, ranging from minor infotainment glitches to more significant engine and transmission problems. While some problems can be addressed with software updates or relatively inexpensive repairs, others may require more costly component replacements. The potential for electrical gremlins and suspension issues are common to the marque, and a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
