The 2022 Suzuki Jimny is a popular compact off-road SUV known for its retro styling, surprising capability, and charming personality. However, it's not without its quirks. The primary engine option is the 1.5-liter K15B inline-four, producing around 101 horsepower and 96 lb-ft of torque. It is available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Drivers appreciate the Jimny's off-road prowess and compact size, making it easy to maneuver in tight spaces. Some common dislikes include its limited cargo space, highway performance, and somewhat dated interior.

* **Engine Misfires/Check Engine Light**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine misfires, often accompanied by the check engine light illuminating. This can be due to faulty ignition coils.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the number of coils and labor)

* **Valve Train Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive ticking or rattling noises coming from the valve train area, especially on cold starts, are reported in some cases. This may be related to the hydraulic lash adjusters.
    * Solution: Replacement of hydraulic lash adjusters.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ (due to the labor-intensive nature of the repair)

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between first and second gear, or hesitation when accelerating from a stop. This could be related to issues with the valve body or transmission control module (TCM).
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update to the TCM can resolve the issue. Other times, valve body replacement or TCM replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on the specific repair)

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **"Death Wobble" at Highway Speeds**
    * Description/Symptoms: A dangerous shaking or wobbling of the front end at highway speeds, commonly known as "death wobble", has been reported by some Jimny owners. This can be attributed to loose steering components, worn suspension bushings, or improper alignment.
    * Solution: Thorough inspection of steering and suspension components, tightening of loose bolts, replacement of worn bushings or ball joints, and a professional wheel alignment.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the wear and tear)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**

    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners, particularly in regions with heavy road salt usage, have reported rust developing on the undercarriage and body panels relatively early in the vehicle's life.
    * Solution: Rust prevention treatments, such as undercoating, and regular washing to remove salt and debris.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the severity and location of the noises)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Suzuki Jimny, while loved for its off-road capabilities and retro charm, does have some common issues. Engine issues, particularly related to ignition coils and valve train noise, can occur. The automatic transmission may suffer from harsh shifting. The "death wobble" and electrical problems with the infotainment system and battery are notable concerns. Rust can be an issue in certain climates, and interior rattles are common. While some issues can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like engine valve train or automatic transmission repairs, can be more costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision and maintenance budget.
