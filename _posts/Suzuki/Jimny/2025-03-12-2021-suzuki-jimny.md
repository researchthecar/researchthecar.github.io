The 2021 Suzuki Jimny is a popular subcompact SUV known for its retro styling, off-road capabilities, and relatively affordable price. It is powered by a 1.5-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing 101 horsepower and 96 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise its compact size, nimble handling, and off-road prowess. Common dislikes include its limited cargo space, fuel economy, and somewhat outdated interior.

**Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine misfires, particularly under load or during acceleration. This can manifest as hesitation, rough idling, or a noticeable lack of power.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of misfires can involve checking spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors, and performing compression tests. Replacing faulty components is the common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups. This may be caused by worn piston rings.
    *   Solution: The solution depends on the cause of the consumption, ranging from valve stem seals to piston ring replacement, or replacing the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on severity.

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted that the 4-speed automatic transmission can exhibit rough shifting between gears, particularly when cold. Delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse has also been reported.
    * Solution: A software update of the transmission control module (TCM) may improve shifting. In more severe cases, transmission service or replacement could be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+ depending on severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Steering Shimmy/Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports exist of steering shimmy or vibration, particularly at highway speeds. This can be caused by improper wheel balance, worn suspension components, or alignment issues.
    *   Solution: Start with wheel balancing and alignment. If the issue persists, inspect and replace worn components such as ball joints, tie rod ends, or wheel bearings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience freezing, crashing, or intermittent malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Software updates may address the issue. If the problem continues, replacing the head unit might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Especially in regions with salted roads, some Jimny owners report rust developing on the undercarriage relatively early.
    *   Solution: Applying rust-proofing treatments can help prevent further corrosion. Existing rust should be treated and protected.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (rust proofing) / $200 - $1000+ (rust repair).

    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling and squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating and isolating the source of the noise can be challenging. Applying felt tape or foam padding to contact points may help dampen vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY) - $200+ (professional repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Suzuki Jimny generally offers a reliable ownership experience, but like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. Engine misfires, excessive oil consumption and transmission issues are among the most concerning. Suspension shimmy and electronic glitches are also present in some models.
