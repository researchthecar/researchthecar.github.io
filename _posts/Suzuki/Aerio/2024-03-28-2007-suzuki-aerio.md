**About the 2007 Suzuki Aerio:**

The 2007 Suzuki Aerio is a compact sedan or hatchback that was available with a choice of two engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 115 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine producing 155 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.

The Aerio was praised for its roomy interior, affordability, and fuel efficiency. However, it was criticized for its lackluster performance and handling, as well as its outdated interior design.
