### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Suzuki Aerio presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanical components like the engine and transmission can be prone to specific issues such as oil leaks, timing chain noise, and automatic transmission harshness, these are often repairable. Suspension components like struts and sway bar links are also common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with power windows and instrument clusters, are noted. Exterior and interior components generally fare better, with fewer widespread critical failures reported. Regular maintenance is crucial for mitigating many of these potential problems and ensuring the longevity of the Aerio.
