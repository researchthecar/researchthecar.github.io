### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Suzuki Aerio presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the automatic transmission, potential oil and coolant leaks from the 2.0L engine, and wear-and-tear items in the suspension like struts and ball joints. Electrical components such as the alternator and window regulators can also be points of failure. Exterior rust is a significant concern, particularly in areas with harsh winters. While the manual transmission and the less common 2.3L engine appear more robust, owners should be aware of these potential repair costs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble are crucial for managing the long-term reliability of the Aerio.
