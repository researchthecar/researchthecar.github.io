### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Suzuki Aerio is a functional vehicle that, while generally affordable to maintain, presents some common reliability concerns. Owners should be aware of potential issues with oil leaks and timing chain noise from the 2.0L engine, as well as transmission problems like harsh shifting in automatics and clutch wear in manuals. Suspension components, particularly struts and sway bar links, can require attention. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, are also reported.
