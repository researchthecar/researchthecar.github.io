The 2004 Suzuki Aerio is a compact car offered as both a sedan and a wagon (Aerio SX). It came with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 141 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciated the Aerio for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency, but criticized its unremarkable styling and somewhat unrefined driving experience. Common complaints often revolved around reliability issues and the availability of parts.

**Summary**
The 2004 Suzuki Aerio can be an economical choice, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly those related to the engine, transmission, and suspension. While some issues, like sensor replacements, are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as transmission problems or catalytic converter failure, can be more costly. Rust is also a significant concern, especially in certain climates. Due to the age of the vehicle and Suzuki's departure from the US market, parts availability may also pose a challenge.
