**Introduction:**

The 2005 Suzuki Aerio is a compact car that was available in sedan and hatchback body styles. It came with two engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 145 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.3-liter four-cylinder with 155 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission. The Aerio was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and versatile cargo space.
