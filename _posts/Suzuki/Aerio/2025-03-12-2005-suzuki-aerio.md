The 2005 Suzuki Aerio is a compact car known for its quirky styling and hatchback/sedan versatility. It was offered with a 2.3L inline-4 engine producing around 155 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Aerio's affordability and spacious interior for its class, while others dislike its somewhat unrefined driving experience and less-than-stellar fuel economy compared to its competitors.

**Summary**

The 2005 Suzuki Aerio has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant issues relate to the engine (timing chain, oil leaks) and transmission (rough shifting, torque converter), which can lead to costly repairs. Suspension components such as strut mounts and bushings are also prone to wear and tear, leading to handling and noise issues. Electrically, power window regulators and alternators can fail. Rust is a prevalent concern, especially in areas with harsh weather. The severity and cost of repairs can vary, but addressing these potential issues promptly is essential to maintaining the vehicle's reliability.
