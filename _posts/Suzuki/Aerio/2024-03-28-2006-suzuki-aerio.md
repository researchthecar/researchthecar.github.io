**Introduction**
The 2006 Suzuki Aerio is a compact hatchback available with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 and a 2.3L inline-4. It offered both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations. The base 2.0L engine produces 125 horsepower and 134 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.3L engine generates 155 horsepower and 158 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual for the 2.0L and a 4-speed automatic for both engines.

Owners praise the Aerio for its affordability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. However, it also receives some criticism for its lackluster performance and inexpensive interior materials.
