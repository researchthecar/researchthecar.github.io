**Introduction:**

The Suzuki X-90 is a compact, two-seater sports car manufactured by Suzuki from 1995 to 1997. It is known for its distinctive styling, which features a removable hardtop and targa roof. The X-90 was available with two engine options: a 1.6-liter 16-valve inline-four and a 1.8-liter 16-valve inline-four. Both engines were paired with a five-speed manual transmission.
