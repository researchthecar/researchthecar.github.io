### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Suzuki Equator generally exhibits good reliability, largely due to its shared platform with the robust Nissan Frontier. Both the 4.0L V6 and 2.5L 4-cylinder engines, as well as the available automatic and manual transmissions, have a strong track record with no widespread, recurring technical failures reported. Similarly, the suspension, electrical systems, exterior, and interior components are not associated with significant common issues. Owners can expect a dependable vehicle, provided regular maintenance is performed. The lack of documented widespread problems across major systems suggests a well-built truck for its class.
