The 2009 Suzuki Equator is a mid-size pickup truck based on the Nissan Frontier. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque and a 4.0L V6 producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (I4 only), a 5-speed automatic (I4 and V6), and a 6-speed manual (V6 only). Owners generally appreciate the Equator's reliability (relative to other trucks of its era), its ruggedness, and its value. Common complaints include lackluster fuel economy, a dated interior, and limited availability of parts due to Suzuki's departure from the US market.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. Can eventually lead to engine misfires and poor performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.0L V6**

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough idling, check engine light illuminated with codes related to camshaft position sensor (P0340, P0345).
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Difficulty shifting gears, and decreased fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sags, especially when carrying a load. Squeaking or creaking noises from the rear suspension. Visible cracks or breaks in the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension when going over bumps. Excessive movement or play in the front struts.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts and possibly the struts themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: HVAC blower motor only works on certain speeds (usually high) or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, slow cranking, dead battery, check battery light on.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust on the vehicle's frame, especially in areas exposed to salt or moisture. Can weaken the frame over time.
    *   Solution: Treat the rust with a rust converter, apply a protective coating, or, in severe cases, replace the affected sections of the frame.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for rust converter and coating) - $2,000+ (for frame repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, often due to sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Tearing of the fabric on the seats, particularly on the driver's seat.
    *   Solution: Seat reupholstering or installation of seat covers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (for seat covers) - $500+ (for reupholstering)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2009 Suzuki Equator shares many of its mechanical components with the Nissan Frontier, leading to similar reliability characteristics. Common issues include timing chain problems in the 2.5L engine, camshaft position sensor and fuel injector failures in the 4.0L engine, and leaf spring sagging/breakage. Electrical issues, such as blower motor resistor and alternator failures, are also prevalent. Rust on the frame is a concern, especially in regions with harsh weather. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. Given Suzuki's exit from the US market, parts availability can be a challenge, potentially increasing repair times and costs.
