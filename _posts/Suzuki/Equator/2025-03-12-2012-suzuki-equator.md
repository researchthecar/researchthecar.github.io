The 2012 Suzuki Equator is a rebadged Nissan Frontier, offering a compact pickup truck option. It came with two engine choices: a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing around 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0-liter V6 generating approximately 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L was available with a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic, while the 4.0L came with a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Equator for its Nissan-based reliability, affordability, and truck utility. Common dislikes included the outdated interior design and limited Suzuki dealer network, especially as Suzuki exited the US market.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially noticeable when cold. Can lead to engine misfires and decreased performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**4.0L V6**

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, rough idling, difficulty starting, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or shaking during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Can also cause slipping or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild may be necessary if damage has occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual (4.0L V6 Only)**

    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the truck sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. Can lead to reduced ride quality and load capacity. Visible cracks in the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noises such as clunking or creaking from the front suspension. Play in the steering wheel and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts, and often the struts themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor only works on certain speeds or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **IPDM (Intelligent Power Distribution Module) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, including starting problems, headlight malfunctions, and other electrical component failures.
    * Solution: Replace the IPDM. This may also require reprogramming.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the frame, especially in areas exposed to road salt. Can lead to structural weakening over time.
    *   Solution: Rust removal and frame coating/repair. In severe cases, frame replacement might be needed, which is costly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+ depending on severity
    * Recalls: **R1304** (Issued August 2013) - Corrosion

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2012 Suzuki Equator shares many of its strengths and weaknesses with the Nissan Frontier. Common issues include timing chain concerns on the 2.5L engine, camshaft position sensor failures on the 4.0L, potential torque converter problems with the automatic transmission, and suspension wear such as leaf spring sagging. Electrical problems, especially with the blower motor resistor and IPDM, can also occur. Frame rust is a major concern, with a recall issued for corrosion on some models. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs.
