**Introduction**

The 2010 Suzuki Equator is a mid-size pickup truck that was offered with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The standard engine is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that produces 153 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine is a 4.0-liter V6 that produces 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic transmission.

The Equator was praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and affordable price. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, poor fuel economy, and dated design.
