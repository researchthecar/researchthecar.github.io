### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Suzuki Vitara, while offering a budget-friendly entry into the SUV market, exhibits common issues typical of vehicles of its age and segment. Engine reliability can be a concern, particularly with head gasket issues on the 2.0L and timing belt/oil consumption on the 2.5L V6. Automatic transmissions may develop slipping or overheating problems. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are prone to wear. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and power window motors are also reported. Exterior rust can be a significant problem in certain climates. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor are also known failure points. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Vitaras remain on the road with proper maintenance, but prospective buyers should budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the powertrain and body integrity.
