The 2018 Suzuki Vitara is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency, agile handling, and available all-wheel drive. In the US market, it was primarily offered with a 1.6-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing around 117 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with either a five-speed manual (FWD only) or a six-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its value and practicality, while others find the engine underpowered for highway driving and wish for more modern interior features.

**Summary**

The 2018 Suzuki Vitara has some common issues, ranging from relatively minor infotainment glitches to more concerning engine and transmission problems.
