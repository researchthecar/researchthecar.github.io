The 2019 Suzuki Vitara is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency, maneuverability, and affordability. The most common engine option is the 1.6-liter four-cylinder producing 115 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque. It is available with either a five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Vitara's compact size, making it easy to park and drive in urban environments, along with its user-friendly infotainment system. Criticisms often include the engine's lack of power, especially when fully loaded or driving uphill, and the somewhat basic interior materials.

**Engine**

**1.6L Four-Cylinder**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. This may manifest as needing to add oil before the next scheduled service.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and consult a mechanic to check for potential causes, such as worn piston rings or valve seals. A compression test can help diagnose the source of the oil consumption.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine hesitating or stalling, particularly during acceleration from a stop or at low speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    * Solution: Check the fuel injectors, mass airflow sensor, and other engine sensors for proper function. Update the Engine Control Unit (ECU) software if available. A diagnostic scan can help identify potential issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component needing repair or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Automatic**
* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds. This can be accompanied by a noticeable clunking sound.
    * Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may improve shifting. If the problem persists, valve body issues may require professional diagnosis and repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    * Solution: Check for software updates for the infotainment system. A hard reset of the system may temporarily resolve the issue. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (unit replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    * Solution: Have the battery tested for its ability to hold a charge. Check for parasitic draws by disconnecting components of the electrical system while measuring the current draw.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for a new battery; $100 - $500+ to diagnose and repair parasitic drain issues.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: In some climates, the dashboard can develop cracks over time, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Applying a dashboard protectant regularly may help prevent cracking. Replacement of the dashboard is possible but can be costly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0-$50 (Dashboard Protectant), $500 - $1500+ (Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Suzuki Vitara, while generally reliable, does exhibit some common issues. The most frequently reported problems involve the engine (oil consumption, hesitation), transmission (rough shifting), and electrical system (infotainment glitches, battery drain). The severity of these issues can vary, but addressing them promptly can help prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's long-term reliability. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like software updates to more significant expenses such as engine or transmission repairs. Overall, it's important to be aware of these potential problems and to have the vehicle regularly inspected and maintained.
