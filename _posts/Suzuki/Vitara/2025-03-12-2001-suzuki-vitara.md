The 2001 Suzuki Vitara is a compact SUV known for its off-road capability and affordability. It came with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-four producing around 127 horsepower and 134 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L V6 generating approximately 155 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praised its ruggedness and nimble handling, while some criticisms included its small size, limited cargo space, and relatively basic interior.
