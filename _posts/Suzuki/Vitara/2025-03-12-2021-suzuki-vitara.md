The 2021 Suzuki Vitara is a subcompact crossover known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability. Engine options typically include a 1.6-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing around 115 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque and a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine boasting approximately 138 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices generally consist of a 5-speed manual (1.6L), a 6-speed automatic (1.6L), or a 6-speed automatic (1.4L Turbo). Owners often praise its compact size for city driving and its decent fuel economy. Criticisms frequently revolve around its somewhat basic interior and limited rear passenger space.

**Engine**

**1.4L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled services. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine knocking.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the ECU can help mitigate the issue by optimizing fuel injection and combustion. More severe cases may require replacing piston rings or other internal engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during gear changes. The transmission might feel jerky or exhibit rough shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. If the problem persists, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may be necessary. In rare cases, valve body issues may require replacement or repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $300+ (depending on the complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Suzuki Vitara presents a mix of potential issues. The 1.4L turbo engine can suffer from excessive oil consumption. The transmission paired with the 1.4L turbo may experience hesitation or rough shifting. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system, and suspension noises are also reported. While most issues are not catastrophic, the potential for engine repairs to address oil consumption can be costly. Addressing electrical and suspension issues is generally less expensive. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
