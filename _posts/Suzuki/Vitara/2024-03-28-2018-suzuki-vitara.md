**Introduction:**
The 2018 Suzuki Vitara is a subcompact crossover SUV offered with two engine options: a 1.6-liter naturally aspirated inline-four (115 horsepower, 114 lb-ft of torque) and a 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-four (140 horsepower, 162 lb-ft of torque). Both engines can be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission.

The Vitara is praised for its compact size, affordability, and fuel efficiency. However, it has received some criticism for its lackluster performance and cheap-feeling interior materials.
