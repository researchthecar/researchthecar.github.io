### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Suzuki Vitara is a capable compact SUV that can offer good value, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine reliability is generally decent, though head gasket failures on the 2.0L and timing chain wear on the 2.5L V6 are notable concerns. Automatic transmissions can experience slipping or overheating, while manual clutches are subject to normal wear. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods may require attention. Electrical issues, particularly with the alternator and power windows, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a significant problem depending on climate. Interior wear and HVAC blower motor failures are common age-related issues. With diligent maintenance and inspection, many of these problems can be managed, but it's advisable to budget for potential repairs.
