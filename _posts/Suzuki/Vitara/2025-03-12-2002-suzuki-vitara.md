The 2002 Suzuki Vitara is a compact SUV known for its off-road capability and small size. It was offered with two main engine options: a 2.0L inline-four producing approximately 127 horsepower and 134 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L V6 generating about 155 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Vitara's affordability and maneuverability, while common complaints revolve around its relatively weak engine performance, especially with the smaller 2.0L, and its somewhat dated interior.

Engine oil leaks and timing chain tensioner problems on the 2.0L, and oil and coolant leaks on the 2.5L V6 are relatively common. Transmission issues like harsh shifting and slipping can also occur, especially in the automatic version. Suspension components like ball joints and shocks/struts are prone to wear. Electrically, power window and alternator failures are frequently reported. Rust is a concern, particularly in areas with harsh weather. Interior issues mainly involve cracked dashboards and broken door handles. The severity and cost of these repairs vary widely, but owners should be prepared for potential expenses in maintaining this older vehicle.
