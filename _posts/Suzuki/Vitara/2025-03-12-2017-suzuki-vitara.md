The 2017 Suzuki Vitara is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and affordability. It was available with either a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 117 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque or a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (1.6L only), a 6-speed automatic, and for some markets, a CVT (continuously variable transmission) with the 1.6L engine. Owners generally appreciate the Vitara's fuel economy, compact size, and ease of parking. Common dislikes include the somewhat basic interior and limited rear passenger space, and lower performance for the non-turbo engine option.

**Summary**

The 2017 Suzuki Vitara has some common issues, primarily related to the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Engine problems, such as excessive oil consumption in the 1.4L turbo engine, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting with the 6-speed automatic, can also be a concern. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and battery drain are relatively common but may have less expensive fixes. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and have the vehicle inspected by a trusted mechanic before purchasing.
