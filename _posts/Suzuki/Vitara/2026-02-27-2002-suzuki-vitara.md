### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Suzuki Vitara is a capable compact SUV that can offer reliable service if well-maintained. Key areas to monitor for potential issues include the engine's head gasket and oil seals, particularly on the 2.0L and 2.5L engines. Automatic transmission problems like slipping and overheating are not uncommon and can be costly to repair. Suspension components such as ball joints and tie rods may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, especially alternator failures and issues with power windows, are also reported. Rust can be a significant concern depending on the vehicle's climate history. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Vitaras have proven durable, especially those with manual transmissions and consistent maintenance records. Prospective buyers should prioritize a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
