The 2020 Suzuki Vitara is a subcompact SUV known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and nimble handling. It came with two engine options: a 1.6-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 115 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.4-liter Boosterjet turbocharged four-cylinder engine making 138 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual (1.6L only), a 6-speed automatic (1.6L and 1.4L), and a CVT (1.6L only in some markets). Owners often praise its compact size for city driving and fuel economy. Common dislikes include a relatively basic interior, limited cargo space compared to some competitors, and occasionally underpowered feel with the 1.6L engine, especially when fully loaded.

**Engine**

**1.4L Boosterjet Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbocharger, loss of power, engine malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warnings, needing to add oil frequently between services, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of consumption (e.g., piston rings, valve stem seals). Repair or replace the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the cause and extent of the repair)

**Summary**

The 2020 Suzuki Vitara generally has a good reputation for reliability, but some common issues have been reported. The 1.4L Boosterjet engine is prone to turbocharger issues and excessive oil consumption. The 6-speed automatic transmission can exhibit rough shifting. Electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and battery drain are also reported. Suspension bushing wear can lead to noise. The severity of these issues varies, and repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major repairs.
