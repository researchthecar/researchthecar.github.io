The 2022 Suzuki Vitara is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and value. Engine options vary by market, but a common configuration includes a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 127 horsepower and 173 lb-ft of torque. A less powerful naturally aspirated 1.6-liter engine is also available in some markets. Transmission options typically include a 6-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual. Owners often praise its affordability and ease of parking, while some common complaints involve the relatively small cargo space and somewhat basic interior materials.
