The 2004 Suzuki Swift+ is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It was primarily sold in Canada, while the closely related Suzuki Aerio served a similar purpose in the United States. A 1.6L inline-4 engine producing around 103 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque powers the Swift+. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its nimble handling and ease of parking. Common dislikes include its somewhat basic interior and limited cargo space.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, especially noticeable at idle or during acceleration. Can also cause clunking noises from the engine bay.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or damaged engine mounts. Typically, all mounts are replaced at the same time to ensure even load distribution and prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, decreased fuel economy, rough idling, and potential failure to pass emissions testing.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor(s). There are typically two oxygen sensors: one upstream of the catalytic converter and one downstream.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, reduced engine performance, rattling noise from under the car, and failure to pass emissions testing.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement when shifting gears, noticeable slipping between gears, or harsh and abrupt shifts.
    *   Solution: Could indicate low transmission fluid, a faulty solenoid, or more serious internal damage to the transmission. Requires diagnosis and repair. Flushing the transmission may help in some situations; however, more involved issues may require valve body repair, solenoid replacement, or a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2500+ (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**
*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, nose-diving during braking, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks. Replacing them in pairs (front or rear) is recommended for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken or Worn Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting lower on one side, clunking noises from the suspension, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken or worn coil springs. Always replace in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Heater or A/C blower fan only working on certain speeds (usually high) or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the undercarriage, wheel wells, and body panels.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. Address rust early to prevent it from spreading.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable, depending on the severity and location of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (cover) - $1000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Suzuki Swift+ can be a reliable and fuel-efficient vehicle, but prospective buyers should be aware of the potential issues outlined above. Engine and transmission issues can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like sensor replacements to more costly repairs such as transmission rebuilds. Suspension components such as struts and shocks are common wear items. Rust is also a potential concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Addressing these potential issues proactively can help ensure the long-term reliability and enjoyment of the vehicle.
