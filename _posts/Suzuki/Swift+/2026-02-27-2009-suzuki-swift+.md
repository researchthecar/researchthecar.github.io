### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Suzuki Swift+ presents a mixed reliability profile. While the powertrain is generally robust with proper maintenance, owners should be vigilant for potential oil leaks and timing chain noise in the engine. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can arise, leading to harsh shifting. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on the vehicle's climate exposure. Overall, the Swift+ can be a dependable vehicle if common issues are addressed proactively, but it is not without its potential repair costs.
