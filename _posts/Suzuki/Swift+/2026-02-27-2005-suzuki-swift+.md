## Engine

### 1.3L Inline-4
**Oil Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil stains under the vehicle, low oil level warnings, burning oil smell.
- **Solution:** Replacement of seals and gaskets (e.g., valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket).
- **Cost:** $150 - $350

**Coolant Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Overheating, visible coolant puddles, sweet smell from engine bay.
- **Solution:** Replacement of hoses, radiator, or water pump.
- **Cost:** $200 - $600


### 1.6L Inline-4
**Timing Belt Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Sudden engine shutdown, no-start condition, rattling noise from the engine.
- **Solution:** Replacement of timing belt, tensioner, and idler pulleys. If failure occurred, potential engine internal damage repair.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800 (preventative), $1500+ (if engine damage)

**Engine Mount Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Increased vibration felt in the cabin, especially at idle or during acceleration.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn engine mounts.
- **Cost:** $200 - $450


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Manual
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Replacement of clutch kit (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $500 - $900


### 4-Speed Automatic
**Harsh Shifting**
- **Symptoms:** Jerky gear changes, delayed engagement.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement, or internal transmission repair/rebuild.
- **Cost:** $250 - $600 (fluid service), $1500+ (rebuild)


## Suspension

### Standard Suspension
**Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, loose steering feel, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Strut Mount Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Popping or creaking noises when turning, especially at low speeds.
- **Solution:** Replacement of front strut mounts.
- **Cost:** $150 - $300


## Electrical

### General Electrical System
**Alternator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Dimming headlights, battery warning light illuminated, difficulty starting.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator.
- **Cost:** $300 - $550

**Window Regulator Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows not operating, slow or jerky window movement.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the window regulator mechanism.
- **Cost:** $150 - $300 per window


## Exterior

### Body Panels & Trim
**Rust Formation**
- **Symptoms:** Visible corrosion on body panels, wheel arches, and undercarriage.
- **Solution:** Rust treatment and repair, panel replacement if severe.
- **Cost:** $100 - $1000+ (depending on severity)


## Interior

### Cabin Components
**HVAC Blower Motor Failure**

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Suzuki Swift+ is a basic subcompact that, while generally affordable to own, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its class and age. Engine issues like oil and coolant leaks are prevalent, particularly with the 1.3L. The 1.6L can be prone to timing belt issues if not maintained. Transmission reliability is generally fair, though automatic transmissions may develop harsh shifting. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear out, leading to noise and steering issues. Electrical problems, such as alternator failure, and exterior rust are also noted. Interior issues are less common but can include HVAC blower motor failures. Regular maintenance, especially for the timing belt on the 1.6L, is crucial for longevity.
