The 2007 Suzuki Swift+, also sold as the Pontiac Wave in some markets, is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and nimble handling. In North America, it was primarily offered with a 1.6L inline-4 engine producing around 103 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. This engine was generally paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its practicality and ease of parking, but some find the engine underpowered, especially for highway driving, and the interior materials to be basic.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, particularly as the vehicle ages. This can manifest as needing to add oil between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and using a higher viscosity oil may help. If consumption is severe, piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:

*   **Check Engine Light - Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates and diagnostic codes point to a faulty oxygen sensor. This can affect fuel economy and emissions.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor, usually the upstream (before the catalytic converter) sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can worsen over time.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might improve shifting. If the problem persists, a valve body issue or internal damage may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (flush) to $1500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, particularly when loaded or on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop functioning, usually one at a time. Motor may make a clicking sound or no sound at all.
    * Solution: Replacing the failed power window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door locks stop functioning properly, either failing to lock or unlock with the remote or interior switch.
    * Solution: Replacing the failed door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Formation of rust on the rear wheel arches, particularly in areas with high road salt use.
    *   Solution: Repairing the rust damage by cutting out the affected area, welding in new metal, and repainting. Prevention through rustproofing treatments.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per wheel arch, depending on severity.

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or using a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800

**Summary**

The 2007 Suzuki Swift+ is a generally reliable subcompact car, but owners should be aware of a few common issues. Engine oil consumption and potential problems with the automatic transmission are the most significant concerns. Suspension and electrical issues are also possible. The severity and cost of repairs can vary, but addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
