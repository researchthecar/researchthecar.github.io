The 2009 Suzuki Swift+ is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and affordability. It came with a 1.6-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 103 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. The Swift+ offers a good value for its price, making it attractive to budget-conscious buyers. It is also a relatively fun to drive car compared to other similar cars in its class. Some common complaints about the Swift+ are the small size of the car making it feel cramped, the lack of modern tech features, and some interior parts feeling cheap.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 1.6L engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This may be indicated by a burning oil smell, blue smoke from the exhaust, or low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: A leak-down test can help determine if the rings or valve seals are damaged. Depending on the root cause, the fix may involve replacing piston rings, valve seals, or even a complete engine rebuild in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the chain to stretch or skip teeth. Symptoms include rattling noises from the engine, especially on startup, and potential engine misfires or failure to start.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioner, and guides. It's often recommended to replace the water pump at the same time, as it's driven by the timing chain in some configurations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 4-speed automatic transmission has rough or erratic shifts, slipping between gears, or difficulty engaging gears. This may be due to worn clutches, a faulty valve body, or contaminated transmission fluid.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change can help in some cases. However, if the problem persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced. A faulty valve body could also be replaced individually.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Swift+ suspension components, such as struts, shocks, and bushings, are prone to wear and tear over time, particularly in areas with rough roads. Symptoms include excessive bouncing, poor handling, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components, such as struts, shocks, bushings, and sway bar links, can restore the vehicle's ride quality and handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that power windows may stop working intermittently or completely. This can be due to a faulty window motor, a damaged switch, or broken wiring.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window motor, switch, or repairing the broken wiring can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Central Locking Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Central locking system malfunctions causing doors to not lock or unlock properly.
    *   Solution: The door lock actuator, wiring, or central locking control unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Swift+ models may be prone to rust, especially in areas with harsh winter conditions or coastal environments. Common rust locations include the wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing rusted body panels and applying rust prevention measures can help extend the vehicle's lifespan.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seatbelt Retractor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seatbelt retractor mechanism may fail, causing the seatbelt to not retract properly or become loose.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty seatbelt retractor can restore the proper functionality of the seatbelt system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Suzuki Swift+ has some common issues including engine issues, transmission issues, suspension wear, and electrical problems. Engine oil consumption and timing chain issues can be costly to address, while suspension and electrical repairs tend to be more affordable. Rust can be a concern in certain regions. While some issues may require significant investment, the Swift+ remains a relatively reliable and affordable vehicle overall, especially if these potential problems are addressed proactively.
