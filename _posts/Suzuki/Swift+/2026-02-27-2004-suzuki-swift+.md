### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Suzuki Swift+ is a basic subcompact that generally performs its intended function without major widespread mechanical failures. However, common issues tend to revolve around aging components such as oil leaks from engine seals, potential timing chain stretch on the 1.5L engine, and wear and tear on suspension parts like ball joints and tie rods. Electrical components like the alternator and window regulators can also be points of failure. Rust can be a concern depending on climate. While not inherently unreliable, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these common age-related issues, especially on higher mileage examples.
