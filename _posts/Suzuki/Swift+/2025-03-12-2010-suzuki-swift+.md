The 2010 Suzuki Swift+, also known as the Suzuki Swift in some markets, is a subcompact car that offered a practical and fuel-efficient driving experience. In the US market, the Swift+ was primarily equipped with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing around 110 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Swift+ for its nimble handling, good fuel economy, and affordability. Common criticisms included its basic interior, limited cargo space, and somewhat underpowered engine, especially when fully loaded or climbing hills.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every few hundred to a few thousand miles, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Initially, monitor oil levels and add oil as needed. If the problem persists, a mechanic can perform a compression test and leak-down test to identify the source of the oil consumption. Potential fixes include replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. In severe cases, engine replacement or rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ (depending on the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be accompanied by a noticeable "clunk" during shifts.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or dirty, a fluid change and filter replacement may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a mechanic may need to diagnose and repair or replace faulty solenoids or valve body components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**
*   **Difficulty Shifting into Reverse**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging reverse gear, sometimes requiring multiple attempts or shifting into another gear first.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the shifter linkage cable may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, a worn or damaged clutch or synchronizer may be the cause, requiring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension components such as struts, shocks, and sway bar links, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Inspect the suspension components for wear and replace any damaged or worn parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power windows, often due to a faulty window motor or switch.
    *   Solution: Test the window switch and motor to determine which component is faulty. Replace the faulty switch or motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to function properly, either not locking/unlocking with the key fob or manual switch, or only working intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Underbody/Exhaust Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop, especially in areas with road salt exposure.
    * Solution: Apply rust-proofing, replace corroded components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2010 Suzuki Swift+ presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While known for its fuel efficiency and handling, owners should be aware of potential engine oil consumption, transmission shifting problems, and suspension wear. Electrical issues with power windows and door locks can also arise. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, with engine repairs potentially being the most expensive. Overall, pre-purchase inspections and regular maintenance are crucial for ensuring the reliability of this vehicle.
