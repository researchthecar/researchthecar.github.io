The 2023 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and nimble handling. It's generally praised for its value and practicality. Conversely, some criticisms focus on its relatively modest power output and somewhat basic interior compared to some competitors. Engine options for the 2023 Swift typically include a 1.2-liter inline-4 (K12C) producing around 82 horsepower and 80 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.0-liter inline-3 turbo (K10C) producing around 109 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, though availability varies by region. Transmission options generally include a 5-speed manual, CVT, and a 6-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**1.2L Inline-4 (K12C)**

*   **Engine Misfires / Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of engine misfires, especially during cold starts, leading to a rough idle and reduced fuel economy. This is often associated with faulty ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s) is the recommended fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the number of coils replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable decrease in engine oil level between service intervals. Can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In extreme cases, piston ring replacement or engine overhaul may be needed, but more commonly, a switch to a higher viscosity oil or shorter service intervals can mitigate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $1500+ (engine work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.0L Inline-3 Turbo (K10C)**

*   **Turbo Lag/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay in power delivery upon acceleration, especially at lower RPMs.
    *   Solution: ECU remapping to optimize turbo response, or inspection of turbocharger components (wastegate, diverter valve) for proper function.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **Shuddering/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable shuddering or jerking sensation, especially at lower speeds or during initial acceleration. This can be caused by degradation of the CVT fluid or internal wear of CVT components.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid flush and replacement using the correct manufacturer-specified fluid. If the problem persists, internal CVT repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 (fluid change), $2000 - $5000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   No Issues Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or squeaking noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Steering may feel loose or vague.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the number of bushings replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes intermittently.
    *   Solution: Software update, or replacement of the head unit if the problem persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update if available), $300 - $1000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises from Dashboard or Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or squeaking noises coming from the dashboard or door panels, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the noise and using felt tape or other sound-deadening material to dampen the vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Suzuki Swift, while generally reliable, has some reported issues. The engine issues, such as misfires and oil consumption, are relatively common but may not be severe in all cases. CVT transmission issues, if present, can be more costly to address. Suspension and electrical problems, while less frequent, can still be annoying. The overall severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs. Prioritizing regular maintenance, and addressing any unusual symptoms promptly, can help mitigate these potential problems.
