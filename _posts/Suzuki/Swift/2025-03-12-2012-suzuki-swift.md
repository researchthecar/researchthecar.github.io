The 2012 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and relatively affordable price point. Engine options typically included a 1.4-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine, producing around 94 horsepower and 95 lb-ft of torque. Depending on the market, other engine options might have been available. Transmission choices generally included a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Swift's sporty feel and ease of parking, while some dislike its basic interior and limited cargo space.

**Summary**

The 2012 Suzuki Swift, while generally reliable, can experience issues common to subcompact cars. The most frequently reported problems revolve around engine misfires, automatic transmission shifting issues, suspension wear, and electrical faults. The severity of these problems ranges from relatively minor (e.g., replacing an ignition coil) to more substantial (e.g., transmission repair). The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the repair shop, but owners should be prepared for potential expenses ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
