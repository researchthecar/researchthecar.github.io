The 2020 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and affordability. In the US market, it was offered with a 1.2-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 83 horsepower and 83 lb-ft of torque, paired with a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) or a 5-speed manual transmission. Common praises include its easy-to-park size, good fuel economy, and decent feature set for its price point. Criticisms often focus on its relatively weak engine, basic interior materials, and limited rear passenger space.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illuminated. Code P0300-P0304 is commonly thrown, specifically indicating a misfire in one or more cylinders.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per coil pack (parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, rough idling. Oxygen sensor codes (P0131, P0134, P0137, etc.) are typically present.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (parts and labor)

*   **Juddering or hesitation during acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car shudders or hesitates momentarily when accelerating, particularly at lower speeds. This may be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A software update to the TCU (Transmission Control Unit) or replacement of the CVT fluid may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for software update and fluid change; $2,500 - $4,500+ for CVT replacement.

**Summary**
The 2020 Suzuki Swift appears to have some common issues, the most concerning of which relates to the CVT transmission. Other potential problems include coil pack and oxygen sensor failures, rear shock absorber wear, battery drain issues, infotainment glitches, and interior rattles. While some issues can be addressed relatively inexpensively, CVT replacement can be a significant expense. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchase, paying particular attention to the performance of the CVT.
