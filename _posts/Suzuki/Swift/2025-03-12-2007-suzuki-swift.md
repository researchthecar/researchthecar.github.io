The 2007 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact car known for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and affordability. In the North American market, it was primarily available with a 1.5-liter inline-4 engine producing around 103 horsepower and 99 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its nimble handling and simple design, but common dislikes include its somewhat basic interior and limited cargo space.
