The 2021 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and nimble handling. Engine options primarily include a 1.2-liter inline-4 (K12C) producing around 82 horsepower and 80 lb-ft of torque, and sometimes a 1.0-liter turbocharged inline-3 (K10C) with around 110 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, depending on the market. Transmission options typically consist of a 5-speed manual, CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission), or a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Swift's low running costs and ease of parking in urban environments, but some dislike the relatively basic interior and limited cargo space.

**Engine**

**1.2L K12C Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. The engine may emit a bluish smoke from the exhaust upon startup.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings has resolved the issue. A compression test can help diagnose the severity of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, and a noticeable loss of power. The check engine light may illuminate with codes related to misfires (P0300-P0304).
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coil pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.0L K10C Inline-3 Turbo**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the turbo, reduced boost pressure, and decreased engine performance. Check engine light might come on with codes related to turbocharger underboost.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Juddering/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced juddering or hesitation during acceleration, particularly from a standstill or at low speeds. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to engage smoothly.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change (using the correct CVT fluid) might help. In more severe cases, the CVT unit may need internal repairs or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid change), $2000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Reduced handling precision and a feeling of looseness in the steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and phone connectivity.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates. In some cases, a system reset or replacement of the unit might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains relatively quickly especially when the vehicle is not driven for a few days.
    * Solution: Replace battery. Check to ensure proper parasitic draw.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises coming from the dashboard or other interior trim pieces, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating and securing the loose trim pieces. This may involve adding foam padding or using adhesive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on severity and DIY vs. professional repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Suzuki Swift, while generally reliable, exhibits a few common issues. Engine problems, such as excessive oil consumption (1.2L) and turbocharger issues (1.0L turbo), can be costly to repair. CVT juddering is another recurring problem. Electrical issues like infotainment glitches and battery drain are also present. Suspension bushing wear and interior rattles can affect the driving experience. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these concerns and thoroughly inspect any used Swift before purchase.
