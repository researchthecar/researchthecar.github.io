**Introduction**

The 2000 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability, compact size, and fuel efficiency. It came with a range of engine and transmission options, including:

- 1.3L 4-cylinder gasoline engine (85 hp, 84 lb-ft torque) paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission
- 1.5L 4-cylinder gasoline engine (100 hp, 94 lb-ft torque) paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission
- 1.6L V6 gasoline engine (107 hp, 110 lb-ft torque) paired with a 5-speed manual transmission

Owners generally appreciate the Swift for its practicality, maneuverability, and low running costs, but criticize its lack of features, limited cabin space, and unrefined engine.
