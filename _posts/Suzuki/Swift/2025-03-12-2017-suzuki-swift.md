The 2017 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and affordability. Available engine options include a 1.2L four-cylinder engine producing around 82 horsepower and 83 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.0L Boosterjet turbocharged three-cylinder engine making about 109 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options vary depending on the engine and trim level, and include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a CVT. Owners often praise the Swift's fun-to-drive nature and compact size, making it ideal for city driving. Some common complaints revolve around the lack of advanced features in the base models and the relatively small cargo space.

**1.0L Boosterjet Turbocharged Three-Cylinder**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of turbocharger failures leading to reduced engine power, unusual noises (whining or hissing), and/or the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the turbocharger is necessary. Replacement of the turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**All Transmissions**

*   **Hesitation During Shifting (Automatic/CVT)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Drivers report a noticeable delay or hesitation when shifting gears, particularly during acceleration. This can be more pronounced in the CVT models.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush may alleviate the issue in some cases. If the problem persists, further diagnosis is needed to rule out valve body issues or other internal damage. Software updates may also address the issue.

**Summary**
The 2017 Suzuki Swift generally presents with a mix of minor and moderate issues. Engine problems such as excessive oil consumption and turbocharger issues can be costly to repair, and the potential for transmission hesitations may detract from the driving experience. Suspension bushing wear and electrical gremlins such as battery drain and infotainment malfunctions are also noteworthy. While these issues aren't universally reported, they are prevalent enough to warrant careful inspection and consideration when purchasing a used 2017 Swift. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from annoying rattles to potentially expensive engine and transmission repairs.
