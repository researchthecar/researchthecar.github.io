The 2014 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and agile handling. It's generally liked for its affordability and easy maneuverability, making it a good city car. However, some owners find the interior materials to be basic and the engine somewhat underpowered, especially when fully loaded or on hills. Engine options typically included a 1.2L four-cylinder engine producing around 94 horsepower and 87 lb-ft of torque, and sometimes a 1.4L engine with slightly more power. Transmission options generally included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2014 Suzuki Swift presents a range of issues that are generally moderate in severity. The most common reported issues are engine-related (coil packs, oxygen sensors) and electrical (central locking, battery drain), and suspension related issues, which can often be repaired without excessive expense. The potential for harsh shifting in the automatic transmission is also present. Most repairs range from around $100 to $500, but major A/C repairs can exceed this range. Addressing issues promptly can prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's reliability.
