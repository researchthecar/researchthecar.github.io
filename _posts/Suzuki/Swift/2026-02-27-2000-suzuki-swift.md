### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Suzuki Swift is a generally reliable subcompact, particularly for its age and price point. The most common issues tend to be related to age, such as oil and coolant leaks from the engine, and wear on suspension components like ball joints and bushings. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can arise, often manifesting as harsh shifting. Electrical components like the alternator and power window motors are also known failure points. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. Interior wear is typical for older vehicles. Overall, while not immune to problems, most issues are repairable and not prohibitively expensive, making it a viable option for budget-conscious buyers if well-maintained.
