The 2019 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and affordability. Engine options for the 2019 model year include a 1.2L four-cylinder engine (K12M) producing around 82 horsepower and 83 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.0L three-cylinder turbocharged engine (K10C) making about 109 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, or a CVT depending on the market and engine. Owners often praise the Swift's fun-to-drive nature and low running costs but sometimes cite the relatively basic interior and limited rear passenger space as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**1.2L K12M Four-Cylinder**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and visible exhaust smoke in severe cases.
    * Solution: In less severe cases, using a higher viscosity oil may help. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection to check for leaks, worn piston rings, or valve seals is necessary. Engine rebuild or replacement might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Ignition Coil Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, check engine light illumination. Diagnostic codes usually point to specific cylinder misfires.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.0L K10C Three-Cylinder Turbocharged**

* **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling noise from the engine bay, check engine light.
    * Solution: Inspection of the turbocharger for damage or leaks. Replacement of the turbocharger may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Direct Injection Fuel System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation on acceleration, and potential carbon buildup on intake valves due to the direct injection system.
    * Solution: Fuel system cleaner additives might provide temporary relief. A professional cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) or fuel injector service may be required for more persistent issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

No Issues Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed gear changes, especially when cold. Some owners report a "clunking" noise when shifting between gears.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might resolve minor issues. More significant problems may require valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT belt slippage/failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Lagging acceleration and high engine RPM with minimal speed increase, or a "rubber band" feel during acceleration. In severe cases, complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Requires a complete CVT replacement or rebuild, including replacing the CVT belt.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, oil leaking from the shock absorber.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Car struggling to start or requiring a jump start, especially after the car has been sitting for a few days.
    * Solution: Test the battery's health and replace if necessary. Check for parasitic drains caused by aftermarket accessories or faulty wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or restarts unexpectedly.
    * Solution: Try updating the software to the latest version. If the problem persists, the unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Hatchback**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming along the seams of the rear hatch.
    * Solution: Repairing and repainting the affected area to prevent the rust from spreading.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks forming on the dashboard, especially in hot climates.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement or applying a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Suzuki Swift, while generally reliable, can experience some common issues. Engine problems such as excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failure (specifically with the 1.0L turbo engine) can be costly. Transmission issues, especially with the CVT, can also lead to significant repair bills. Other problems like battery drain, infotainment glitches, and suspension wear are less severe but still worth noting. Overall, the severity and cost of potential repairs range from minor fixes to major overhauls, so a thorough inspection before purchase is recommended.
