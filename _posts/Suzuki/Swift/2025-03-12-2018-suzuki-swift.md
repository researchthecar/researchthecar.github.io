The 2018 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and affordability. Engine options varied by market, but generally included a 1.2L inline-4 naturally aspirated engine (K12M/K12C), producing around 82-90 horsepower and 88-120 Nm of torque, and a 1.0L inline-3 turbocharged engine (K10C), producing around 100-110 horsepower and 150-170 Nm of torque. Transmission choices typically included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a CVT. Owners often praise the Swift's responsive steering and compact size, making it ideal for city driving. Common dislikes include a less refined interior and limited cargo space compared to some competitors.

**Summary:**

The 2018 Suzuki Swift generally exhibits reliable performance, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine issues seem to revolve around ignition coils on the 1.2L and turbocharger problems on the 1.0L. Transmission issues, particularly with the manual, could lead to clutch or gearbox repairs. Suspension bushing wear can cause unwanted noises and affect handling. Battery drain, door handles and dashboard rattles are less severe and costly but should be considered. Overall, most issues are relatively minor and can be addressed without significant expense, but turbocharger failures can be costly. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is recommended.
