The 2010 Suzuki Swift is a popular subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and sporty handling. In the Australian market, the most common engine option was the 1.4-liter inline-4 producing around 70 kW (94 hp) and 130 Nm (96 lb-ft) of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its nimble nature and affordability, while others find the interior materials and rear seat space lacking. Common dislikes include road noise and a somewhat basic feature set.
