The 2022 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and affordability. Engine options typically include a 1.2-liter Dualjet inline-4 producing around 82 horsepower and 80 lb-ft of torque, or a 1.0-liter Boosterjet turbocharged inline-3 that produces around 110 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission), and a 6-speed automatic depending on the engine and trim level. Owners often praise its sporty feel, compact size for city driving, and value for money, while common dislikes include the somewhat basic interior, limited rear passenger space, and relatively modest power output.

**Engine**

**1.2L Dualjet Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. This may be noticeable by a burning smell or visible smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and consult a mechanic to check for leaks, valve seal issues, or piston ring wear. A compression test can help diagnose internal engine problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and the engine malfunction indicator lamp illuminating. Can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cylinder causing the misfire. Replace faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.0L Boosterjet Inline-3**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whining noise from the turbocharger, or the engine malfunction indicator lamp illuminating. Can be caused by wastegate malfunction or bearing failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the turbocharger. Repair or replace the turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on if it can be repaired, or must be fully replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Direct Injection Fuel System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, rough idling, or reduced fuel economy. Can be caused by carbon buildup on the intake valves, a common issue with direct injection engines.
    *   Solution: Perform an intake valve cleaning (walnut blasting). Install a catch can to mitigate carbon buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or jerky movements during acceleration, especially at low speeds. The CVT may feel sluggish or unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Check and replace the CVT fluid. Recalibrate the CVT.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, especially first or reverse. Grinding noises may be heard during shifting.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Vehicle may feel unstable or exhibit excessive body roll.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, strut mounts).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Perform a system reset. Update the software. Replace the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car is left unused for a few days. Difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Test the battery. Inspect the electrical system for parasitic drains.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on if the battery or the system is causing the drain.

**Summary:**

The 2022 Suzuki Swift, while generally reliable, can experience issues across various systems. Engine problems, especially oil consumption and turbocharger issues, can be more severe and costly to repair, particularly for the Boosterjet engine. Transmission issues, infotainment glitches, and suspension wear are also concerns.
