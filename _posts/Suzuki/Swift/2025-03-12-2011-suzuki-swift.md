The 2011 Suzuki Swift is a subcompact car known for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and affordability. In the US, it was typically equipped with a 1.4-liter inline-4 gasoline engine, producing approximately 95 horsepower and 95 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Swift's compact size, easy parking, and responsive steering. Common complaints include a somewhat basic interior and limited cargo space.

**Engine**

**1.4L Inline-4 (K14B)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic should inspect for leaks or internal engine damage. In some cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the cause and repairs needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to engine misfires, rough idling, and potential engine damage. Symptoms may include a rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup.
    *   Solution: Timing chain replacement, including associated components like tensioners and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter replacement may improve shifting. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the repairs needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bushings in the suspension system can wear out over time, leading to clunking noises, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings, which may include control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, and strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on which bushings need replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Regulator**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working, or move slowly or erratically.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system may fail to lock or unlock the doors properly, or may function intermittently.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the problem. It could be a faulty door lock actuator, a wiring issue, or a problem with the central locking module. Replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and repairs needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion Around Rear Hatch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust may form around the rear hatch, especially near the license plate lights and handle.
    *   Solution: Remove rust, treat the affected area, and repaint. Address any underlying causes of moisture buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the severity of the rust and the quality of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Belt Retractor Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat belt may not retract properly, making it difficult to buckle.
    *   Solution: Clean the seat belt and mechanism. If this doesn't work, the seat belt retractor may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Suzuki Swift has some common issues, with engine problems like oil consumption and timing chain issues being potentially the most expensive to address. Suspension and electrical problems can also occur, though typically at a lower cost. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and perform regular maintenance to minimize the risk of major repairs.
