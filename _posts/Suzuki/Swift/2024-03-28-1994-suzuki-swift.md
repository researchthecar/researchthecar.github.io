**1994 Suzuki Swift**

The 1994 Suzuki Swift is a compact hatchback known for its affordability, fuel-efficiency, and sporty handling. It is available with a variety of engine and transmission options, including a 1.3-liter and 1.6-liter gasoline engine, and a three-speed automatic and five-speed manual transmission.

Owners generally praise the Swift's peppy performance, responsive handling, and comfortable interior. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of power at highway speeds and its somewhat cramped rear seats.

**Summary**

The 1994 Suzuki Swift is generally a reliable and affordable car. However, it can experience some common issues, including engine timing belt failures, transmission solenoid and clutch failures, suspension strut mount and tie rod end failures, electrical alternator and starter failures, exterior tail light and headlight switch failures, and interior dashboard cracking, seatbelt pretensioner, and airbag failures. The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the specific problem and the severity of the damage. Regular maintenance and timely repairs can help prevent or minimize these issues.
