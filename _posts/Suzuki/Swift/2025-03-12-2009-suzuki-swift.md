Engine options for the 2009 Swift typically include a 1.3-liter inline-4 engine producing around 91 horsepower and 87 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5-liter inline-4 engine producing around 100 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque, depending on the market. Transmission choices usually consist of a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Swift's sporty driving experience and low running costs, while some criticisms include limited rear passenger space and basic interior features.

**Engine**

**1.3L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust (especially on startup), a burning oil smell, and low oil levels indicated by the oil pressure light.
    *   Solution: A potential fix is to replace the valve stem seals to prevent oil from leaking into the combustion chamber. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to engine rattling noises, especially upon startup. In severe cases, a broken timing chain can cause significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L Inline-4**

*   **VVT (Variable Valve Timing) Actuator Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some models with the 1.5L engine have experienced issues with the VVT actuator. This can cause rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and a noticeable loss of power, especially at lower RPMs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty VVT actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, and a burning smell when the clutch is engaged.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or delayed shifts between gears, slipping in certain gears, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Begin with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $2500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn bushings on the control arms, sway bar, and struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the number of bushings replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Strut Mounts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or creaking noises when turning the steering wheel, especially at low speeds. Can also cause a knocking sound when driving over uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Power Window Switch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows that intermittently fail to operate or stop working altogether.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS warning light illuminated on the dashboard. Reduced or non-functional ABS system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ABS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

**Summary**

The 2009 Suzuki Swift, while generally reliable, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and timing chain problems, along with transmission issues such as rough shifting, can lead to moderate to significant repair costs. Suspension and electrical problems are usually less expensive to address. Rust on the rear wheel arches is a cosmetic concern that can become more serious if left untreated. Overall, pre-purchase inspection focusing on these specific areas is highly recommended to avoid unexpected expenses.
