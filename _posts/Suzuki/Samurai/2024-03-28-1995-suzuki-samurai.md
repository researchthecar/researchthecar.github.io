**1995 Suzuki Samurai**

Introduced in 1985, the Suzuki Samurai is a compact, off-road SUV known for its ruggedness and maneuverability. It came with two engine options: a 1.3-liter carburetor engine and a 1.6-liter fuel-injected engine, both paired with a 5-speed manual transmission and featuring four-wheel drive. While it was popular for its off-road capabilities, it also faced criticism for its lack of safety features and poor on-road handling.

**Engine**

**1.3-Liter Carburetor**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption:** Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket and rear main seal, resulting in low oil levels and potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace valve cover gasket and rear main seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
