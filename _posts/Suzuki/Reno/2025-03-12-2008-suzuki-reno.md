The 2008 Suzuki Reno is a compact hatchback known for its affordability and spacious interior, but it also has some common issues. It was only available with one engine option, a 2.0L inline-4 producing around 127 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. It came with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Reno's value for the money and the generous cargo space. However, the car is often criticized for its lackluster performance, fuel economy, and build quality.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

* **Check Engine Light due to Evaporative Emission System (EVAP) Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and diagnostic codes related to the EVAP system (e.g., P0440, P0455) are stored. You may also notice a fuel smell.
    * Solution: Inspect the gas cap for proper sealing, check the EVAP hoses for cracks or leaks, and test the purge valve and vent valve for proper operation. Faulty vapor canisters can also be a cause.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the component that needs replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of coolant, overheating, and visible leaks around the engine area.
    * Solution: Inspect the water pump, radiator hoses, and radiator for leaks. Replace any damaged components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component that needs replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes related to oxygen sensor malfunction (e.g., P0131, P0134). Reduced fuel economy and rough idling may also occur.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission shifts roughly, hesitates, or slips between gears.
    * Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change may temporarily improve the symptoms, but if the problem persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Delayed Engagement**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay when shifting into drive or reverse.
    * Solution: Similar to harsh shifting, begin by checking fluid level and condition. Internal damage to the transmission, such as worn clutches or valve body issues, could be the cause.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    * Solution: Replace the worn struts or shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Broken or Worn Springs**
    * Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride height, sagging of the vehicle on one side, and clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension.
    * Solution: Replace the broken or worn springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows that are slow to operate, intermittent, or completely inoperative.
    * Solution: Check the window motor, switch, and wiring for damage. Replace any faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per window.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door locks that are difficult to lock or unlock, or that fail to respond to the remote or switch.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the undercarriage and body panels, especially in areas prone to moisture and salt exposure.
    * Solution: Treat surface rust with rust inhibitor and paint. For severe rust, panel replacement or welding may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Loose or Broken Interior Trim**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loose or broken plastic trim pieces around the dashboard, door panels, and center console.
    * Solution: Replace or repair the damaged trim pieces.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the piece.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Suzuki Reno is prone to a number of issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical problems to more significant engine and transmission concerns. EVAP system leaks, cooling system issues, and oxygen sensor failures are common engine-related problems. The automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting and delayed engagement. Suspension issues include worn struts/shocks and broken springs. Electrical issues include power window and door lock actuator failures. Rust is common on the body and undercarriage. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the severity of the problem, but major repairs such as transmission overhauls can be quite expensive. Buyers should carefully inspect any used Reno for these issues and factor potential repair costs into their purchase decision.
