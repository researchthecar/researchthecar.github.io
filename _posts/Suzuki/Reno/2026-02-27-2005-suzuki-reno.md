### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Suzuki Reno presents a mixed reliability profile. While its powertrain is generally robust, owners should be prepared for potential issues with oil and coolant leaks from the 2.0L engine. Transmission problems, particularly harsh shifting in automatics and clutch wear in manuals, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts can require replacement, and electrical gremlins such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster issues are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. Interiorly, the HVAC blower motor is a known failure point. Overall, the Reno can be a cost-effective vehicle if these common issues are addressed proactively.
