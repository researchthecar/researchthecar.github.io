The 2005 Suzuki Reno is a compact hatchback known for its affordable price and spacious interior. It came equipped with a 2.0-liter inline-four engine producing around 127 horsepower and 131 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission was standard, with a 4-speed automatic transmission available as an option. While praised for its value and practicality, the Reno was also criticized for its unrefined driving experience and reliability issues.
