The 2007 Suzuki Reno is a compact hatchback known for its affordability and spacious interior. It was only offered with one engine option, a 2.0L inline-4 producing 127 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. While the Reno offered good value for the money, some common complaints included its lackluster fuel economy, unrefined engine, and questionable reliability. Owners often appreciated its comfortable seats and user-friendly controls.
