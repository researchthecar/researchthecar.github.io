The 2006 Suzuki Reno is a compact hatchback known for its affordability and distinctive styling. It came equipped with a single engine option, a 2.0-liter inline-four cylinder engine producing around 127 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Reno's value for the money, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. However, common complaints included reliability issues, subpar fuel economy, and a lack of refinement compared to its competitors.

**Summary**

The 2006 Suzuki Reno suffers from several common issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical and suspension problems to more serious engine and transmission concerns. Engine misfires, coolant leaks, timing belt issues, and automatic transmission harsh shifting are the most concerning from a cost and potential damage perspective. Rust is also a common issue, particularly in regions with road salt. While the Reno was an affordable option when new, the potential for costly repairs should be carefully considered when purchasing a used model. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potential mechanical failures, and the cost to repair can range from a few dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem.
