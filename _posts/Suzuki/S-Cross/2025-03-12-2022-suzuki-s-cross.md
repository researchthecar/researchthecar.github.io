The 2022 Suzuki S-Cross is a subcompact crossover SUV offering a blend of practicality and value. In many markets, it's powered by a 1.4-liter Boosterjet turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 127 horsepower and 173 lb-ft of torque. It is often paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. A mild-hybrid system is also available. Owners often praise its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and spacious interior for its class. Common criticisms include its somewhat dated interior design, limited advanced safety features compared to some competitors, and a less engaging driving experience.

**Engine**

**1.4L Boosterjet Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. This may manifest as a low oil warning light or noticeable drop in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any underlying causes such as leaks or internal engine issues. A compression test can help identify potential problems. In some cases, a new engine with updated components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis can cost $100 - $300. If a new engine is required, the cost can exceed $5,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported turbocharger failure, leading to loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling) from the engine, and potentially an engine warning light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. Inspecting the oil feed lines to the turbocharger for blockages is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have described experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly during upshifts or downshifts at lower speeds. Hesitation or delayed response when accelerating from a standstill is also reported.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update may resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission overhaul might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush and software update: $200 - $400. Valve body replacement: $800 - $1,500. Transmission overhaul: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, replacing the head unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $0 - $150 (if not covered under warranty). Head unit replacement: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported intermittent or persistent malfunctions of driver-assistance systems, such as parking sensors or blind-spot monitoring. These may trigger warning lights or error messages.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific sensor that is malfunctioning and replacing it. Checking wiring and connections for damage or corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poorly Aligned Panels**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed poor alignment with body panels, which create uneven gaps between body panels.
    * Solution: Loosen and realign the body panels.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area. These noises can be particularly noticeable on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and tightening loose fasteners or applying felt tape to reduce friction between components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2022 Suzuki S-Cross appears to have some common issues related to the engine (oil consumption, turbocharger failures), transmission (harsh shifting), and electrical systems (infotainment, sensor malfunctions). Interior rattles and exterior panel gaps may also be a concern for some owners. While some issues may be minor and easily resolved with software updates or simple repairs, others, such as turbocharger failures or transmission overhauls, can be more costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider having a thorough inspection performed before purchasing.
