The 2021 Suzuki S-Cross is a compact crossover SUV known for its practicality, affordability, and fuel efficiency. It typically features a 1.4-liter Boosterjet turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 127 horsepower and 173 lb-ft of torque. The engine is available with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the S-Cross for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and standard features, while others find the styling bland and the performance adequate but not exciting. Some common criticisms include the lack of advanced driver-assistance systems compared to competitors and the relatively basic interior design.

**Engine**

**1.4L Boosterjet (K14C)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels closely and topping up as needed. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection may be required to check for leaks or internal engine issues. Some cases might involve piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or whistling noises from the turbocharger, reduced power, and potentially turbocharger failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic to determine the source of the problem. Replacement of the turbocharger may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation between gears, jerky or abrupt shifts, and overall lack of smoothness in the transmission's operation.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be required, potentially involving valve body inspection or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay when shifting into drive or reverse, often accompanied by a clunking sound.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush might resolve the issue, but in some cases, internal transmission repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. Reduced handling precision and vague steering feel.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.) and replacement of worn or damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the bushings that need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a reset. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a software update on the infotainment system. If the problem persists, a dealer visit may be necessary for further diagnostics or replacement of the unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates to $500+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., TPMS, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alarms or inaccurate readings from the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) or parking sensors. This can lead to warning lights on the dashboard and potentially inaccurate information.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor is usually the fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing the loose trim pieces. This may involve adding padding or tightening fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (depending on complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Suzuki S-Cross, while generally reliable, has some reported issues. The most concerning are engine-related, such as excessive oil consumption, and potential turbocharger problems. Transmission issues, particularly rough shifting, can also detract from the driving experience. Electrical glitches and interior rattles are less severe but can be annoying. The potential cost of repairs ranges widely depending on the issue, but engine and transmission work can be particularly expensive.
