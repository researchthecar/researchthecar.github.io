The 2017 Suzuki S-Cross is a subcompact crossover SUV that offers a blend of practicality and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a 1.0L turbocharged 3-cylinder (Boosterjet) producing around 110 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, a 1.4L turbocharged 4-cylinder (Boosterjet) producing around 140 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L naturally aspirated 4-cylinder engine. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual (1.0L), a 6-speed manual (1.4L), and a 6-speed automatic (available with both 1.4L and 1.6L). The S-Cross is often praised for its comfortable ride and relatively spacious interior for its class. Common criticisms include a somewhat dated interior design and lackluster performance from the base engine.

**Summary**
The 2017 Suzuki S-Cross, while generally reliable, has reported issues centered around the 1.4L Boosterjet engine's turbocharger, the 6-speed automatic transmission, and electrical gremlins like infotainment system issues and battery drain. Interior rattles and tailgate latch problems are also common complaints. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others like turbocharger or transmission repairs can be costly. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of them and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing.
