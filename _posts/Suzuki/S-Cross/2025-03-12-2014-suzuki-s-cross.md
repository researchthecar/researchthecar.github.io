The 2014 Suzuki S-Cross is a subcompact crossover SUV that offers a blend of practicality, fuel efficiency, and affordability. Engine options include a 1.6-liter M16A inline-4 petrol engine producing around 118 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter D16AA diesel engine producing around 118 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consist of a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, and a CVT. Owners often praise its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and good fuel economy. However, some common complaints include the somewhat bland styling, limited off-road capability compared to some rivals, and potential reliability issues.

**Engine**

**1.6L M16A Petrol**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, especially in higher mileage vehicles. Symptoms include needing to top up oil frequently between scheduled services and potential low oil warning light illumination.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks, using the correct grade of oil, and potentially replacing valve stem seals or piston rings in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idle or Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a rough idle, stalling, or hesitation, especially at lower speeds or when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor, cleaning the throttle body, checking for vacuum leaks, or replacing the spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L D16AA Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF clogging is a common issue, especially with predominantly short journeys. Symptoms include reduced engine power, DPF warning light, and potential forced regeneration cycles.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration, driving at higher speeds for extended periods, or replacing the DPF in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to poor engine performance, rough idle, and increased emissions.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**
*   **Shuddering or Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a shuddering or jerking sensation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can be caused by worn CVT belt or issues with the valve body.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid flush and refill with the correct fluid type. Replacement of the CVT belt or valve body may be necessary in more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delay or Hesitation When Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delay or hesitation when shifting between drive and reverse, or during simulated gear changes.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid level check and top-up. If the problem persists, a more in-depth diagnostic check is required, potentially leading to valve body repairs or complete CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to leaks and reduced damping performance. This results in a bouncy or unstable ride, especially on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported unexplained battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been parked for a few days.
    *   Solution: Checking for parasitic drains by testing all electrical components, replacing the battery, or repairing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing or Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing or crashing of the infotainment system, causing loss of navigation, radio, and other functions.
    * Solution: Software update, or replacement of the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard area, especially when driving on rough roads. This can be caused by loose trim pieces or wiring harnesses.
    *   Solution: Identifying and securing the source of the rattle, potentially adding foam padding or replacing clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Suzuki S-Cross has a mix of potential issues, with the CVT transmission and diesel engine potentially presenting the most concerning and costly problems. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, such as oil consumption and dashboard rattles, others like DPF clogging and CVT problems could lead to significant repair bills. Electrical gremlins and suspension issues, while less common, should also be considered when evaluating the vehicle. Overall, a thorough inspection and service history review are crucial before purchasing a used 2014 Suzuki S-Cross.
