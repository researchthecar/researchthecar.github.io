The 2015 Suzuki S-Cross is a subcompact crossover known for its fuel efficiency and relatively spacious interior for its class. Engine options include a 1.6-liter petrol engine producing around 118 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter diesel engine. Transmission choices include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual (diesel only), and a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners generally appreciate the S-Cross for its affordability and fuel economy, but some dislike its somewhat bland styling and basic interior.
