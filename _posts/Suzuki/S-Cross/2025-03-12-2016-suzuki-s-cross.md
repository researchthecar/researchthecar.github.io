The 2016 Suzuki S-Cross is a compact crossover SUV that offers a blend of practicality, fuel efficiency, and affordability. The 2016 model year came with a 1.6L M16A inline 4-cylinder engine producing 118 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque. Some common likes about the S-Cross are its spacious interior for a car of it's size, good fuel economy, and comfortable ride. Common complaints are that it could use more power, the interior is bland, and the infotainment system is outdated. The available transmissions were a 5-speed manual or a CVT.

**Engine**

**1.6L M16A Inline 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can be indicated by the low oil pressure light illuminating or the engine running rough.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and potentially replacing the piston rings or valve stem seals if consumption is excessive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration and Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the CVT exhibiting jerky acceleration, hesitation, or a feeling of "rubber banding" during normal driving. This may be more pronounced during uphill climbs or when trying to accelerate quickly.
    *   Solution: A software update may address some of these issues. In severe cases, replacement or rebuild of the CVT may be necessary. Start by replacing the transmission fluid with Genuine Suzuki CVT fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $300 (software update) - $3000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, particularly in the front lower control arms. This can lead to clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps, and can affect steering precision.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side, depending on whether only the bushings or the entire arm are replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the car is not driven frequently. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly test the battery and charging system. Check for parasitic draws by aftermarket accessories. Replace the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (battery replacement), additional for diagnosing and repairing parasitic draws.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory infotainment system, if equipped, can sometimes experience freezing, crashing, or slow response times.
    *   Solution: Software updates may address some of these issues. A replacement aftermarket unit could be another solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $300+ (aftermarket replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2016 Suzuki S-Cross presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While generally reliable, owners should be aware of potential problems with the CVT, excessive oil consumption, and suspension bushing wear. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
