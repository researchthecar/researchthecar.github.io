The 2005 Suzuki Verona is a mid-size sedan that aimed to offer a comfortable and affordable option. It was only offered with one engine option: a 2.5-liter inline-six engine producing 155 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciated the Verona's smooth ride and spacious interior, while others disliked its relatively poor fuel economy and bland styling. Common complaints often revolved around reliability issues and the availability of parts.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-Six**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported the 2.5L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups. Symptoms included a low oil light illuminating, noticeable blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine knocking if oil levels dropped too low.
    *   Solution: The solution can range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, or even a full engine rebuild depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported the timing chain on the 2.5L engine stretching or failing prematurely. This can lead to a rattling noise from the engine, poor performance, and eventually, engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission sometimes exhibits harsh or erratic shifting, especially between gears. Slipping can also occur, where the engine revs but the car doesn't accelerate properly.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement can improve shifting. However, more severe cases might require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the struts and shocks on the Verona tend to wear out relatively quickly. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and bottoming out over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Check Engine Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light is prone to illumination, often for a variety of sensor-related issues (O2 sensors, mass airflow sensor, etc.).
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific code triggering the light and replacing the faulty sensor or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working or operate intermittently due to motor failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2005 Verona can be susceptible to rust, particularly in areas with harsh winters or high salt exposure. Common rust spots include the rocker panels, wheel wells, and around the door seams.
    *   Solution: Rust repair can range from simple patching to extensive panel replacement depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard is prone to cracking, especially in hotter climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $800+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Suzuki Verona is plagued by a number of reliability issues that can lead to significant repair costs. Engine-related problems, such as excessive oil consumption and timing chain issues, are prevalent and can be expensive to address. Transmission problems, especially harsh shifting and slipping, are also common. Suspension and electrical issues add to the potential maintenance burden. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major repairs to the engine or transmission can be costly. Given the age of the vehicle and the potential for these issues, prospective buyers should carefully inspect any 2005 Verona before purchasing and budget for potential repairs.
