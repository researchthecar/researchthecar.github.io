### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Suzuki Verona presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around age-related wear, particularly with oil leaks from the engine, and potential problems with the transmission, especially the automatic variant. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and alternators, can occur. Exterior rust is a concern for vehicles in certain climates. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to seals, gaskets, and aging electrical and mechanical parts. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining this vehicle.
