The 2006 Suzuki Verona is a mid-size sedan that was known for its relatively affordable price and comfortable ride. It came with a single engine option: a 2.5L inline-6 producing 155 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the spacious interior and smooth engine. Common dislikes included uninspired styling, mediocre fuel economy, and concerns about long-term reliability and parts availability due to Suzuki's departure from the US market.
