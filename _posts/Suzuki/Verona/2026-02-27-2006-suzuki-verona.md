### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Suzuki Verona presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine's sealing (oil and coolant leaks), transmission performance, and wear on suspension components like bushings and ball joints. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and instrument clusters, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. While not plagued by catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these common problem areas. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble can help mitigate costs and keep the Verona running.
