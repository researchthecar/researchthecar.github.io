The 2004 Suzuki Forenza is a compact sedan known for its affordable price point and relatively spacious interior for its class. It came standard with a 2.0-liter DOHC inline-four engine producing approximately 127 horsepower and 131 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Forenza's value and roomy cabin, but common complaints often revolve around its reliability, particularly concerning electrical issues, and less-than-stellar fuel economy.
