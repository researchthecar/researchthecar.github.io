The 2005 Suzuki Forenza was a compact sedan offering a somewhat budget-friendly option in its class. It was equipped with a 2.0L DOHC inline-4 engine producing approximately 127 horsepower and 131 lb-ft of torque. The Forenza wasn't particularly known for its performance or refinement, but some owners appreciated its affordability, distinctive styling, and relatively spacious interior. Common criticisms included build quality issues, unrefined engine, and reliability concerns. It came with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
