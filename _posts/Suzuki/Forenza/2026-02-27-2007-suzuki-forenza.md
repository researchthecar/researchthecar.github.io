### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Suzuki Forenza presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly with the automatic transmission experiencing harsh shifting and torque converter problems. Engine concerns include oil and coolant leaks, and for turbocharged variants, potential turbocharger issues. Suspension components like struts and sway bar links can wear out, leading to ride quality and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor and door lock actuators are not immune to failure. While not a vehicle plagued by catastrophic failures, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and maintenance needs.
