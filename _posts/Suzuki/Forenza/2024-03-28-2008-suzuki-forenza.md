**Introduction to the 2008 Suzuki Forenza**

The 2008 Suzuki Forenza is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable and well-equipped interior. It is available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The 2.0-liter inline-four produces 136 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.3-liter inline-four produces 173 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.
