# 2004 Suzuki Forenza

### Overview
The 2004 Suzuki Forenza, a compact sedan and wagon, was a product of GM's global platform strategy, sharing components with other GM brands. While offering a decent value proposition at the time of its release, its long-term reliability has been a mixed bag. Owners have reported a number of recurring issues, particularly concerning the powertrain and certain electrical components. The vehicle's design, while functional, did not always translate to robust durability, leading to some common failure points that can affect the driving experience and ownership costs. Regular maintenance is crucial, but some issues appear to be inherent design or component quality concerns.

### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Suzuki Forenza presents a mixed reliability profile. While the manual transmission generally holds up better, the automatic transmission can experience issues with harsh shifting. Engine concerns primarily revolve around oil and coolant leaks, often due to aging seals and gaskets. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module and alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on climate, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor and seat fabric may show premature wear. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in repair costs.
