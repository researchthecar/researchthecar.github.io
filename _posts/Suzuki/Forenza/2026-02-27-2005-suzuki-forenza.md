### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Suzuki Forenza presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. While it can be an economical choice, potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly concerning the engine (oil and coolant leaks, timing belt on V6) and transmission (automatic shifting problems, manual clutch wear). Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts can also require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster issues, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. Despite these potential drawbacks, many issues are repairable, and addressing them proactively can help maintain the vehicle's functionality. Overall, it's a car that may require more attention to maintenance and potential repairs compared to some competitors in its segment.
