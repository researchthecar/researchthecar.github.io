The 2006 Suzuki Forenza is a compact sedan that aimed to provide value and practicality. Its primary engine option was a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 127 horsepower and 131 lb-ft of torque. This engine was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Forenza's spacious interior and affordability. Common dislikes included its lackluster fuel economy, unrefined engine, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Engine Misfires/Check Engine Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may experience misfires, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and illumination of the check engine light. The diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) often point to issues with the ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s) and/or spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the number of coils and plugs replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points in the cooling system, including the radiator, hoses, water pump, or thermostat housing. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak. This may involve replacing hoses, the radiator, water pump, or thermostat housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the timing belt breaks, it can cause major engine damage due to interference between the valves and pistons. Symptoms include a sudden loss of power and the engine failing to start. Regular replacement is critical.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt and any associated components (e.g., water pump, tensioner) according to the manufacturer's recommended interval. If the timing belt breaks while the engine is running, the engine may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for timing belt replacement alone; significantly more for engine repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough or jerky shifting between gears. The issue is often attributed to issues with the valve body, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Initially, ensure the transmission fluid is at the correct level and in good condition. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be inspected and potentially rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for fluid service, $500 - $1500+ for valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip out of gear or hesitate before engaging a gear. This can occur during acceleration or while maintaining a constant speed. This is often a sign of internal transmission wear.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush might help in some cases. In more severe instances, the transmission will need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for fluid service, $1500 - $3500+ for rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride comfort, excessive bouncing, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the parts replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front end, especially when going over bumps. Can also affect alignment and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or, if necessary, the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side, depending on the extent of the damage and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows may fail to operate, either intermittently or completely. This can be due to a faulty window motor, switch, or wiring.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the failure and replace the faulty component (window motor, switch, or wiring harness).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the component replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check Engine Light remains illuminated despite no issues, or illuminates because of a faulty sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the component replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may have trouble starting, stall frequently, or run erratically. A check engine light will usually be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion and rust on the underbody, particularly in areas exposed to road salt. Can lead to structural damage over time.
    *   Solution: Treat and repair rust spots. Apply rust inhibitors to protect the underbody. Severe cases may require panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the rust and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracks**

**Summary**

The 2006 Suzuki Forenza can present several common issues as it ages, ranging from engine and transmission problems to suspension and electrical glitches. Engine misfires, coolant leaks, and timing belt concerns are key areas to watch for in the engine category. Transmission issues like harsh shifting and slipping are also common. Suspension wear and tear, especially with struts and control arm bushings, can impact ride quality and handling. Electrical problems, such as power window malfunctions and sensor failures, can also occur. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission overhauls or extensive rust repair, can be costly. The severity of these issues varies, but addressing them promptly is essential to maintain the vehicle's reliability and safety.
