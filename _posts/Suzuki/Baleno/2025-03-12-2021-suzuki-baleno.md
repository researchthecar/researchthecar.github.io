The 2021 Suzuki Baleno is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior relative to its size, and affordability. Engine options vary by market, but commonly include a 1.2-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing around 82 horsepower and 84 lb-ft of torque, or a 1.0-liter turbocharged inline-3 "Boosterjet" with approximately 110 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options generally include a 5-speed manual, or an automatic transmission (either a CVT or a more conventional automatic, depending on the market and engine choice). Owners often praise its value for money, fuel economy, and ease of driving in urban environments. Common complaints include perceived lack of power from the base engine, road noise, and basic interior finish.

**Engine**

**1.2L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between service intervals. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and potentially engine knocking if the oil level becomes critically low.
    * Solution: Regular oil level checks and top-ups. In some cases, a dealer inspection may be needed to determine the cause and if piston ring replacement is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Inspection is usually free. Piston ring replacement can be $800 - $2,000+ depending on the shop and the extent of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.0L Turbocharged Inline-3 "Boosterjet"**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report premature turbocharger failure, leading to a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or screeching) from the engine bay, and potentially the engine running in limp mode.
    * Solution: Turbocharger replacement. It is critical to identify the cause of the failure to prevent repeat occurrences.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Difficulty Shifting into Gear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced difficulty shifting into certain gears, especially first or second, or reverse. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: Check and adjust the shift linkage. If the problem persists, clutch replacement or transmission repair might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Shift linkage adjustment is typically $50 - $150. Clutch replacement can range from $400 - $1,200+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Automatic Transmission (CVT or Conventional)**

* **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported jerky acceleration or hesitation during gear changes (if a conventional automatic) or during acceleration (if a CVT). This can be more noticeable at lower speeds.
    * Solution: For a CVT, a CVT fluid change might help. For a conventional automatic, a transmission fluid flush and/or software update may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change or Transmission flush $150 - $300. Valve body repair/replacement $800 - $2,000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, leading to clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, particularly when driving over bumps.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn bushings. Inspecting the suspension regularly and replacing worn components promptly can prevent further damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushing replacement can range from $100 - $400+ per corner, depending on the specific bushing and labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    * Solution: Software update, if available. In some cases, a complete infotainment system reset or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is usually free at the dealer. Infotainment system replacement can range from $500 - $1500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the car battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine.
    * Solution: Check for parasitic draws (electrical components drawing power when the vehicle is off). A battery test can determine if the battery needs replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery test is usually free. Battery replacement is typically $100 - $300. Identifying and fixing parasitic draws can range from $100-$500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Poor Quality Door Seals**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin during heavy rain or car washes due to inadequate door seals.
    * Solution: Replacing the weather stripping / door seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200+ per seal, plus labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling Noises from Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises coming from the dashboard, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    * Solution: Locating and securing the source of the rattle. This may involve adding foam padding or tightening loose screws.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on complexity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2021 Suzuki Baleno, while generally a reliable and affordable vehicle, has some common issues. Engine problems, such as excessive oil consumption (1.2L) and turbocharger failure (1.0L Boosterjet), can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, ranging from shifting difficulties to jerky acceleration, also appear. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and battery drain are other recurring complaints. While minor issues like suspension bushing wear and interior rattles exist, the severity and cost are generally lower. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing.
