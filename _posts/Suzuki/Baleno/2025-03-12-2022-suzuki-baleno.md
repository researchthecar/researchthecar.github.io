The 2022 Suzuki Baleno is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and spacious interior for its class. The Australian market for the 2022 Baleno was primarily powered by a 1.4-liter four-cylinder petrol engine (K14B) producing around 68 kW (91 hp) and 130 Nm (96 lb-ft) of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its affordability and practicality, while others find the engine underpowered and the interior materials basic. Common complaints revolve around the lack of modern features and safety equipment compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**1.4L K14B**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust pipe during acceleration may also be present.
    * Solution: A compression test to determine the condition of piston rings and cylinder walls. Replacing piston rings or, in severe cases, rebuilding the engine. Switching to a higher viscosity oil may provide a temporary solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rough Idling and Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine may idle unevenly or stall, particularly when cold. This can sometimes be accompanied by a check engine light.
    * Solution: Inspect and clean or replace the throttle body. Check the Mass Airflow (MAF) sensor and replace if faulty. Inspect spark plugs and ignition coils.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the affected parts.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed gear changes, or a sensation of the transmission slipping during acceleration.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. In severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on severity and parts needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

* **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision and tire wear.
    * Solution: Inspect and replace worn control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, and shock absorber bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per axle depending on the number of bushings replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash randomly.
    * Solution: Check for software updates and install the latest version. A hard reset of the system can sometimes resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (head unit replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain quickly, especially if the car is left unused for a few days.
    * Solution: Have the battery tested to determine its health and replace if necessary. Check for parasitic draws by testing the current draw with the car off.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement or diagnostics to isolate parasitic drain.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattles and squeaks from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces.
    * Solution: Locate the source of the noise and use felt tape or foam to dampen the vibrations. Tighten any loose screws or fasteners.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ depending on complexity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2022 Suzuki Baleno appears to have relatively minor issues reported. The most notable is excessive oil consumption in the 1.4L engine. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and suspension bushing wear are also reported. The severity and cost of repairs vary, with engine and transmission issues potentially being the most expensive to resolve. Overall, the issues are not widespread but should be considered when evaluating a used 2022 Baleno.
