### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Suzuki XL-7 is a capable SUV with a generally decent reliability record for its age and class. The most common concerns tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly the V6 engine's timing belt and potential oil leaks, as well as the automatic transmission's tendency for harsh shifting or slipping. Suspension components like ball joints and springs can also wear out. Electrical issues, such as power window failures and instrument cluster problems, are not uncommon.
