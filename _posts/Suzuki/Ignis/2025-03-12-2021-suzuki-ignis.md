The 2021 Suzuki Ignis is a compact and fuel-efficient city car, known for its distinctive styling, practicality, and affordable price point. It is popular for its easy maneuverability and decent features for its class. Some drivers dislike its smaller size and limited power. The Ignis is primarily equipped with a 1.2-liter four-cylinder petrol engine, producing around 82 horsepower and 80 lb-ft of torque. This engine is typically paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

**Engine**

**1.2L Four-Cylinder Petrol Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the oil light illuminating or noticing a significant drop in oil level during routine checks.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and using the correct grade of oil are recommended. In some cases, a dealer inspection may be necessary to identify any underlying issues like valve stem seal leakage or piston ring wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Variable, depending on the root cause. An oil change is typically $50-$100. If the issue is valve stem seals or piston rings, the cost could range from $500 - $2,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, loss of power, and the engine warning light illuminating are common symptoms. This can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause using an OBD-II scanner and replace the faulty components. Spark plugs should be inspected and replaced as part of regular maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Spark plug replacement: $80-$200. Ignition coil replacement: $150-$300 per coil. Fuel injector replacement: $200-$500 per injector.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerky acceleration or hesitation, particularly when pulling away from a standstill or during low-speed maneuvers. The CVT may feel less smooth compared to a traditional automatic transmission.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid flush and inspection. If the issue persists, consult a mechanic for further diagnosis, as it could be related to the CVT's internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid flush: $150-$300. CVT repair/replacement: $2,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Knocking or squeaking noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision.
    * Solution: Replace worn bushings. Inspection of control arms and other suspension components is recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+ depending on the specific bushings and labor involved.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, or intermittent malfunctions with the infotainment system. Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates. A hard reset of the system might resolve minor glitches. In some cases, the unit might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: Varies, often free at the dealership. Infotainment system replacement: $500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains prematurely, causing difficulty starting the engine, especially after the car has been idle for a few days.
    *   Solution: Have the charging system tested, including the alternator and battery. Check for parasitic drains (unusual current draw when the car is off).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement: $100-$300. Alternator replacement: $300-$600. Parasitic drain diagnosis and repair: Variable, depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and secure loose trim pieces or panels. Foam padding or adhesive can be used to dampen vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Usually minimal, but labor costs can vary depending on the complexity of the repair. $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture accumulating inside the headlight lenses.
    *   Solution: Check for cracks or damage to the headlight housing. Ensure the vent caps are properly installed. If the condensation is severe, the headlight unit might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Headlight replacement: $300+ per unit.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2021 Suzuki Ignis generally experiences minor issues, primarily related to the infotainment system and occasional drivetrain concerns. Engine oil consumption can be a concern and should be checked. Most issues are relatively inexpensive to resolve, though potential CVT issues could lead to more significant repair costs. The severity of these issues is generally low to moderate, with most owners experiencing only minor inconveniences.
