The 2020 Suzuki Ignis is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, distinctive styling, and surprisingly spacious interior for its size. The Ignis comes with a 1.2-liter four-cylinder K12C Dualjet engine producing around 82 horsepower and 80 lb-ft of torque. This engine is available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners appreciate its maneuverability in urban environments and affordability, but some dislike its somewhat basic interior and limited power, especially when fully loaded.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption (Rare)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil level warning light illuminating and visible blue exhaust smoke, especially during startup.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and top up as needed. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic should investigate potential causes such as worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test can help diagnose ring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis can range from $100-$300. Repair costs depend on the cause; worn rings or valve stem seals can cost $1000 - $3000+ depending on the extent of the work needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jerkiness/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced jerkiness or hesitation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can feel like a momentary delay or a shudder when accelerating from a stop or slow speed.
    *   Solution: A software update of the transmission control module (TCM) might alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, a CVT fluid change using the correct Suzuki-specified fluid is recommended. In more severe cases, internal CVT damage may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update - $100 - $200. CVT fluid change - $200 - $400. CVT rebuild/replacement - $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes or spontaneously reboots. This can interrupt navigation, audio playback, and Bluetooth connectivity.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. If the problem persists, a software update from the dealer may be available. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update - $0 - $100 (often covered under warranty). Infotainment system replacement - $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Fog Light Cracking (Specific Regions)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In areas with frequent exposure to road salt or gravel, the plastic fog light lenses are prone to cracking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fog light assembly. Consider aftermarket protective film or covers in high-risk areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per fog light.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling from Dashboard/Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels, particularly on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and secure the loose component. This may involve adding foam padding, tightening screws, or replacing clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the complexity and whether a professional is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2020 Suzuki Ignis has relatively few widespread issues. The most notable complaints involve CVT performance and infotainment system glitches. While oil consumption can occur, it's not a common issue. The severity of these problems ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs, especially if the CVT requires replacement. Overall, the Ignis is a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these possible issues and check for them during a pre-purchase inspection.
