The 2018 Suzuki Ignis is a subcompact hatchback known for its quirky styling, fuel efficiency, and surprisingly spacious interior for its size. It came with a 1.2-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 82 horsepower and 83 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a CVT automatic. Owners appreciate the Ignis's maneuverability, light weight, and affordability. Common complaints include a lack of power, particularly when fully loaded or driving uphill, and some concerns about interior trim quality.

**Engine**

**1.2L Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. This can manifest as the need to add oil more frequently than usual, and if left unchecked, can lead to engine damage.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and using the correct grade of oil are recommended. In severe cases, a cylinder leak-down test may be needed to identify the cause, which might involve piston ring replacement or valve stem seal repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2500+ (depending on the root cause and required repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating can indicate engine misfires. Potential causes include faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cylinder(s) affected and replacing the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**CVT Automatic**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported jerky acceleration and hesitation, especially from a standstill or at low speeds. This can also manifest as a feeling of the transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change with the correct fluid type is often the first step. If the problem persists, a more in-depth diagnosis of the CVT may be necessary, potentially requiring valve body repair or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3000+ (depending on severity and solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of early wear on suspension components, like shock absorbers and bushings, leading to a bouncy ride, knocking sounds over bumps, and reduced handling stability. This can be more pronounced on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn shock absorbers, bushings, or other affected suspension parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the parasitic drain by testing each circuit and component. Common culprits can include aftermarket accessories improperly installed or a faulty module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, and occasional crashes of the infotainment system have been reported.
    *   Solution: Sometimes a software update can resolve the issue. In other cases, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if a software update resolves the issue) - $500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Weak Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators failing, causing doors not to lock or unlock properly with the remote or interior switches.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report various rattling noises coming from the dashboard, door panels, and rear cargo area, particularly when driving on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing the loose components. This may involve adding sound dampening material or replacing clips/fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Suzuki Ignis, while a practical and fuel-efficient car, does have some reported issues. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption, electrical issues, and suspension component wear are the most concerning due to their potential impact on reliability and safety. Jerky acceleration with the CVT is also a commonly reported issue, with the potential to be minor and low-cost, or severe and more costly. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection crucial.
