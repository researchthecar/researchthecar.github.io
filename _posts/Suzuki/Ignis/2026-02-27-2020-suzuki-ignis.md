### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Suzuki Ignis demonstrates strong reliability, particularly with its standard 1.2L petrol engine and manual transmission. The primary area where minor concerns have been noted is the AGS automated manual transmission, which can occasionally exhibit less refined gear changes. However, this is generally not indicative of a major mechanical failure and often resolvable with software adjustments. Other systems such as suspension, electrical components, and interior/exterior elements are reported to be robust. Overall, the Ignis is a dependable choice for urban driving, with a low likelihood of significant unexpected repair costs beyond routine maintenance and potential minor adjustments to the AGS system.
