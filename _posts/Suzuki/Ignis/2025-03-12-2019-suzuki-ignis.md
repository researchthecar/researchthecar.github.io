The 2019 Suzuki Ignis is a subcompact hatchback known for its quirky styling, fuel efficiency, and surprising agility in urban environments. In many markets, it's primarily offered with a 1.2-liter four-cylinder petrol engine producing around 82 horsepower and 83 lb-ft of torque, coupled with either a 5-speed manual or a CVT automatic transmission. Some regions also offer a mild-hybrid version, improving fuel economy. Owners often praise the Ignis for its affordability, easy maneuverability, and distinctive design. Common dislikes include the somewhat basic interior, limited cargo space, and occasionally a perceived lack of refinement compared to larger vehicles.
