The 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara is a compact SUV that offered a blend of off-road capability and on-road comfort. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque and a 2.7L V6 producing 185 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (only available with the 2.0L engine) and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally liked its compact size, maneuverability, and relative affordability. Common dislikes included the somewhat underwhelming fuel economy and the basic interior.
