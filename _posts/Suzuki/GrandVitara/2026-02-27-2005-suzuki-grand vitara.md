### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Suzuki Grand Vitara offers a capable and relatively affordable package, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine reliability varies by specific engine option, with V6 models being more prone to head gasket issues and all engines susceptible to oil leaks and timing chain wear. Automatic transmissions can experience slipping and overheating. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can arise. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor and power window regulators can fail. Despite these potential issues, many Grand Vitaras remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
