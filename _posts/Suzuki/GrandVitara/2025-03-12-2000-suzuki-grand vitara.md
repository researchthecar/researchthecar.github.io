The 2000 Suzuki Grand Vitara is a compact SUV known for its off-road capability and relatively affordable price point. Engine options include a 2.0L inline-4 producing around 127 horsepower and 134 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L V6 producing around 155 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
