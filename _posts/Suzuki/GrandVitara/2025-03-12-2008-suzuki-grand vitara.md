The 2008 Suzuki Grand Vitara is a compact SUV known for its off-road capabilities and rugged design. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 137 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 producing 185 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L V6 producing 230 horsepower and 213 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (available with the 2.0L) and a 4-speed automatic (standard with the 2.7L and available with the 2.0L). A 5-speed automatic was standard with the 3.2L. Owners often appreciate its smaller size compared to other SUVs, its value for the price, and its true 4x4 system. Common complaints include the relatively low fuel economy, less refined interior, and limited cargo space.
