**Summary**

The 2012 Suzuki Grand Vitara, while a capable off-roader, is subject to a variety of common issues. Engine issues, such as timing chain and VVT solenoid failures, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission problems, including rough shifting and torque converter failure, are also frequently reported. Suspension components, like struts/shocks and sway bar links, are prone to wear and tear. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain issues and power window motor failures, add to the ownership concerns. Although dashboard cracking does not affect the vehicles usability, it is an aesthetic issue and very common on older models. Depending on the severity of these issues, repair costs can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, making it important for potential buyers to have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase.
