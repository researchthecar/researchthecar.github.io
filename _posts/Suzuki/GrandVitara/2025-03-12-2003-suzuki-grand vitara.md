The 2003 Suzuki Grand Vitara is a compact SUV known for its off-road capability and relatively affordable price point. Engine options include a 2.0L inline-four (127 hp and 134 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.5L V6 (165 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its smaller size for city driving and its ability to handle light off-road trails. However, common complaints include a somewhat cramped interior, less refined ride compared to competitors, and issues related to the age of the vehicle, such as rust and worn-out components.
