The 2017 Suzuki Grand Vitara is a compact SUV known for its off-road capabilities and simple, rugged design. It came equipped with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing around 166 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate its reliability (when properly maintained), off-road prowess, and simple mechanicals. Common dislikes include its dated styling, poor fuel economy, and relatively small interior for its class.

**Engine**

**Summary:**

The 2017 Suzuki Grand Vitara, while generally reliable, has some common issues to watch out for. Timing chain issues and automatic transmission problems can be relatively costly to repair, so paying attention to any unusual noises or shifting behavior is crucial. Suspension and electrical problems are less serious but can still be inconvenient. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs. Inspecting these areas during a pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
