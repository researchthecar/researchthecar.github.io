The 2007 Suzuki Grand Vitara is a compact SUV known for its off-road capability and relatively affordable price point. Engine options include a 2.0L inline-4 (140 hp, 137 lb-ft torque) and a 2.7L V6 (185 hp, 184 lb-ft torque). Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual (typically with the 2.0L) or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Grand Vitara's ruggedness and maneuverability. Common dislikes include its fuel economy, somewhat dated interior, and less refined ride compared to some competitors.
