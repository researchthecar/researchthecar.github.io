### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Suzuki Grand Vitara presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanical components like the engine and transmission are generally solid, with the 2.7L V6 being the primary exception due to VVT actuator issues, some electrical and exterior components have reported failures. Power window motors and keyless entry fobs are common electrical culprits, and the rear hatch latch can be prone to corrosion. These issues are typically repairable and not indicative of catastrophic failure, but they do represent potential costs beyond standard maintenance. Overall, it's a capable SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific weak points.
