The 2002 Suzuki Grand Vitara is a compact SUV known for its off-road capability and relatively affordable price point. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing around 127 horsepower and 134 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L V6 engine making approximately 155 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine. Owners often appreciate the Grand Vitara's compact size, maneuverability, and four-wheel-drive system. Common complaints revolve around its fuel economy, relatively small interior space, and some reliability issues, especially with higher mileage examples.

**Summary**

The 2002 Suzuki Grand Vitara is generally considered a decent vehicle, but it is not without its issues, particularly given its age. Engine oil leaks, timing chain problems (2.0L), and transmission shifting issues are among the more concerning problems that can be expensive to repair. Suspension wear and electrical issues like alternator failure are also common. Rust can be a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can quickly add up, making it crucial to thoroughly inspect any potential purchase and factor in potential maintenance costs.
