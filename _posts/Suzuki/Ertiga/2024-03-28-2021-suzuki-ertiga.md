**Introduction**
The 2021 Suzuki Ertiga is a compact MPV that combines practicality and affordability. It comes with a single engine and transmission option: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Ertiga offers a roomy cabin, good fuel economy, and a competitive price tag. However, there have been some reported issues with the vehicle.

### **Engine**
- **1.5-Liter Gasoline Engine**
  - **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption has been reported by some owners. Symptoms include low oil levels on the dipstick and blue smoke from the exhaust. The issue requires engine disassembly and replacement of piston rings, oil pump, and other components. Estimated cost: $2,000 - $4,000+
  - **Head Gasket Failure:** Head gasket failure has also been reported, causing coolant and oil leaks, overheating, and decreased engine performance. The solution involves replacing the head gasket and resurfacing the cylinder head. Estimated cost: $1,500 - $2,500
  - **Timing Chain Rattle:** Some owners have experienced a noisy timing chain, particularly on cold starts. The issue requires replacement of the timing chain and related components. Estimated cost: $1,000 - $2,000

### **Transmission**
- **4-Speed Automatic Transmission**
  - **Slipping:** Some owners have reported transmission slipping, resulting in sluggish acceleration and delayed gear shifts. The transmission needs to be overhauled or replaced. Estimated cost: $2,500 - $4,000+
  - **Hard Shifting:** Hard or jerky gear shifts have also been encountered. The issue may require solenoid replacement or transmission fluid change. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,500

### **Suspension**
  - **Strut Noise:** Noisy struts have been reported, causing rattling or creaking sounds while driving over uneven roads. Replacing the faulty struts is the solution. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000 per pair

### **Electrical**
  - **Alternator Failure:** Some owners have experienced alternator failures, leading to battery discharge and electrical system problems. Alternator replacement is required. Estimated cost: $700 - $1,200
  - **Battery Drain:** Battery drain has been reported, possibly due to a faulty module or parasitic draw. Identifying and addressing the source of the drain is necessary. Estimated cost: $200 - $500

### **Exterior**
  - **Rust on Undercarriage:** Rust on the undercarriage has been observed in some vehicles, particularly in areas exposed to moisture and salt. Undercoating or rustproofing is recommended as a preventative measure. Estimated cost: $300 - $800+

### **Interior**
  - **Climate Control Malfunction:** Malfunctioning climate control systems have been reported, affecting temperature control and airflow. The issue may require replacement of the climate control module or AC compressor. Estimated cost: $500 - $2,000+
  - **Dashboard Rattle:** Some owners have experienced dashboard rattling, particularly on rough roads. Tightening loose fasteners or adding damping material can reduce the noise. Estimated cost: $100 - $300

### **Summary**
Overall, the 2021 Suzuki Ertiga has received mixed reviews. While it offers practical features and affordability, it has been plagued by several issues, particularly with the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Some of these issues can be costly to repair, impacting the vehicle's overall value and reliability.
