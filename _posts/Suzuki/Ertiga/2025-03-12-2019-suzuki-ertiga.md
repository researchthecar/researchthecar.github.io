The 2019 Suzuki Ertiga is a compact MPV known for its affordability and spacious interior, making it a popular choice for families in certain markets. The 2019 model generally features a 1.5-liter K15B inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 103 horsepower and 101 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise its fuel efficiency, maneuverability in urban environments, and comfortable seating for up to seven passengers. Common criticisms include its somewhat underpowered engine, basic interior materials, and limited advanced safety features.

**Engine**

**1.5L K15B Inline-4**

* **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and potential stalling, often accompanied by a check engine light. This can be due to faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s) and/or spark plugs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the number of coils replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, reduced fuel efficiency, and potentially rough engine performance. Faulty oxygen sensors can cause the engine control unit (ECU) to miscalculate the air-fuel mixture.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected oxygen sensor(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ depending on the sensor location (upstream or downstream).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Leaking Fuel Injectors**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, reduced fuel efficiency, fuel smell in the engine bay, and rough idle.
    * Solution: Replacing the fuel injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, particularly between first and second gear. This can be caused by worn-out solenoids within the transmission or contaminated transmission fluid.
    * Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and, if necessary, replacing the faulty solenoids.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+ for fluid flush; $300 - $800+ for solenoid replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine revving excessively without corresponding acceleration, or the transmission failing to engage gears properly. This can be due to low transmission fluid, worn clutch packs, or internal damage.
    * Solution: Checking and topping off transmission fluid. If the problem persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 for fluid; $1500 - $4000+ for rebuild or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and longer stopping distances.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn shock absorbers or struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle (front or rear).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Damaged Stabilizer Bar Links**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps or turning.
    * Solution: Replacing the damaged stabilizer bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per link.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Faulty Power Window Switch**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window not responding to the switch, intermittent operation, or complete failure of the power window.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty power window switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle not starting, requiring frequent jump-starts, or a dead battery after sitting for a short period. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty electrical component.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve testing various circuits and components. Replacing the battery if needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for diagnosis and repair, plus the cost of a new battery if required.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Malfunctioning Door Lock Actuators**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door not locking or unlocking with the remote or the interior switch, or intermittent operation.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Not Blowing Cold**
    * Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning system blowing warm air, reduced cooling performance, or unusual noises from the AC compressor. This can be due to a refrigerant leak, a faulty AC compressor, or a clogged condenser.
    * Solution: Recharge the AC refrigerant if there is a leak, replace the AC Compressor if it has failed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for recharge, $400-$1200+ for compressor replacement.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Suzuki Ertiga, while generally reliable, can experience issues with its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and interior. Engine-related problems include misfires, O2 sensor failure and fuel injector leaks. The 4-speed automatic transmission can suffer from harsh shifting or slipping. Suspension issues involve worn shock absorbers and damaged stabilizer bar links. Electrical problems may manifest as faulty power window switches or battery drain. Interior issues often relate to the AC and rattles. While some repairs, such as replacing spark plugs or stabilizer bar links, are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds or AC compressor replacements, can be costly.
