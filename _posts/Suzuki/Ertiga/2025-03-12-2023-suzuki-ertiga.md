The 2023 Suzuki Ertiga is a popular compact MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and affordability. It typically comes with a 1.5-liter K15B inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 103 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. Depending on the market, it is available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its practicality, comfortable ride for passengers, and fuel economy, while common criticisms include its relatively low power output, especially when fully loaded, and the somewhat dated 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**1.5L K15B Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating. This can be caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s) and/or spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an unusually high amount of oil between oil changes, requiring frequent top-ups. This may be due to worn piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source of the oil consumption. Depending on the cause, the solution could range from replacing valve seals to a complete engine overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission shifts harshly between gears, slips out of gear, or hesitates during acceleration. This can indicate issues with the valve body, worn clutch packs, or low transmission fluid level.
    *   Solution: Inspect the transmission fluid level and condition. A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement might resolve minor issues. For more severe problems, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced, or the entire transmission may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
