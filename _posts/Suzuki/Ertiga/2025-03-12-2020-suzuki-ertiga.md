The 2020 Suzuki Ertiga is a popular compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency, and affordability. In some markets, it is sold with a 1.5-liter K15B inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 103 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Ertiga's practicality and value, but some criticisms include the relatively basic interior and modest power output.
