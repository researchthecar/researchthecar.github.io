The 2015 Suzuki Kizashi is a mid-size sedan that was praised for its sporty handling, comfortable ride, and well-equipped interior. However, it faced limited sales due to Suzuki's departure from the US market. The Kizashi came with a single engine option: a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 185 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Some common praises for the Kizashi are its value for the money, its agile handling and comfortable seating. Common complaints include limited rear passenger space, and issues with parts availability after Suzuki's departure from the US market.
