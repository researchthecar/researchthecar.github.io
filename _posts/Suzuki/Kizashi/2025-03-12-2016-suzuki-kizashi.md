The 2016 Suzuki Kizashi is a mid-size sedan that aimed to offer a sporty driving experience with a touch of luxury. All Kizashi models came equipped with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 185 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. The engine was available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). All-wheel drive (AWD) was also available as an option. Owners often praised the Kizashi for its sharp handling, comfortable ride, and upscale interior for its price point. However, some common complaints included limited rear seat space, a relatively small trunk, and the fact that Suzuki no longer supports the brand in the US, leading to concerns about parts availability.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning light, engine noise, and visible exhaust smoke.
    * Solution: Possible solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or even the entire engine in severe cases. A compression test can help diagnose the root cause.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some Kizashis experience premature timing chain wear or stretching, leading to rough running, decreased performance, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides. It's often recommended to replace the water pump at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
* **CVT failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission may have shuddering on acceleration or deceleration, slipping, jerking, unusual noises, or a complete failure. These symptoms may indicate issues with the CVT chain, valve body, or internal bearings.
    * Solution: CVT fluid change, replacement of valve body or complete transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or clunking noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Excessive play in the strut assembly.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, even when the car is not in use. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    * Solution: Diagnose parasitic draw by testing amp draw on each fuse. Replace the faulty component such as an alternator, light, relay, etc.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners in regions with heavy road salt usage have reported rust developing around the wheel wells, door seams, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, priming, and painting. Rust-proofing treatments can help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, make excessive noise when opening/closing, or leak.
    * Solution: Clean sunroof tracks, replace motor, or replace sunroof assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2016 Suzuki Kizashi, while appreciated for its driving dynamics and features, can suffer from several issues. The most concerning potential problem is the CVT transmission failure, which can be costly to repair or replace. Other reported problems include oil consumption in the engine and possible timing chain issues. Suspension and electrical problems are also reported, but they are less severe and costly on average. Due to Suzuki's departure from the US market, parts availability and finding qualified mechanics familiar with the Kizashi may present additional challenges.
