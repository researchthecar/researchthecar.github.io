The 2014 Suzuki Kizashi is a mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling and unique styling. It came standard with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine producing 185 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While appreciated for its driving dynamics and standard features, the Kizashi suffered from low sales and Suzuki's exit from the US market, making parts and service more challenging. Common complaints revolved around the CVT transmission, availability of replacement parts, and some electrical issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.4L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust (though not always), and the need to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis typically involves checking for leaks, performing a compression test, and potentially a cylinder leak-down test to assess the condition of the piston rings. If the piston rings are found to be the cause, an engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear or stretching of the timing chain. This can manifest as a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and can eventually lead to engine misfires and poor performance if the timing is affected.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and associated guides is the standard fix. It's crucial to use updated parts to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is perhaps the most commonly reported issue. Symptoms include hesitation during acceleration, erratic shifting, a whining noise from the transmission, and eventually complete transmission failure. Diagnostic trouble codes related to the CVT are often present.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change *might* help in early stages, but often the damage is done. Replacement or rebuild of the CVT is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Jerky/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced jerky or rough shifting, especially at low speeds. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change with the correct fluid type is the first step. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required, potentially pointing to valve body issues or internal CVT damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150+ for fluid change; $1,500 - $3,000+ for valve body or internal repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, particularly in the front control arms. This can lead to clunking noises, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings or complete control arm assemblies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures (ABS, Crankshaft Position, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensor failures have been reported, including ABS sensors and crankshaft position sensors. Symptoms vary depending on the sensor but can include warning lights on the dashboard, erratic engine behavior, and ABS malfunction.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement of the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for an extended period. This can be difficult to diagnose, as it may not leave any diagnostic codes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking for parasitic draws on the electrical system, possibly caused by a faulty module or aftermarket accessory. The source of the draw must be identified and repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues (in Rust-Prone Areas)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicles in areas with heavy road salt use have exhibited rust, particularly around the wheel wells and rocker panels.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, which may involve cutting out rusted sections and welding in new metal, followed by painting. Rust prevention measures like undercoating can help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per panel, depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the sunroof mechanism, including it getting stuck, making unusual noises, or leaking.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof mechanism, seals, or motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Suzuki Kizashi, while enjoyable to drive, has a number of potential issues owners should be aware of. The CVT transmission is a significant concern, with the potential for costly repairs or replacement. Oil consumption and sensor failures are also relatively common. Parts availability can be a challenge given Suzuki's departure from the US market, which may drive up repair costs. The severity of potential issues ranges from minor sensor replacements to major engine or transmission work.
