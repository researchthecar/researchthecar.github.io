The 2010 Suzuki Kizashi is a mid-size sedan that aimed to offer a sporty driving experience and upscale features at an affordable price. All 2010 Kizashis came with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, producing 185 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque when equipped with the manual transmission, and 180 horsepower with the CVT. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciated the Kizashi's handling, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. Common complaints included limited rear seat space, a relatively small trunk, and the eventual difficulty in sourcing parts due to Suzuki's withdrawal from the US market.

**Summary**

The 2010 Suzuki Kizashi, while praised for its driving dynamics and styling, has several common issues. The most significant concern is the potential for CVT transmission problems, which can be expensive to repair. Engine issues such as timing chain problems and excessive oil consumption are also noteworthy. Other problems, such as suspension sagging, electrical issues, rust, and dashboard cracking, are less severe but still worth considering. Due to Suzuki's departure from the US market, finding parts and qualified technicians can be challenging, potentially increasing repair costs.
