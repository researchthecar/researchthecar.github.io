**Introduction to the 2012 Suzuki Kizashi**

The 2012 Suzuki Kizashi is a midsize sedan that was available with two engine options: a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine producing 185 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, or a 3.6L V6 engine producing 265 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a 6-speed manual or continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Kizashi received praise for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and responsive handling, but was criticized for its lackluster fuel economy and dated exterior design.
