The 2011 Suzuki Kizashi is a mid-size sedan that aimed to blend sporty handling with a comfortable ride. It was offered with a single engine option: a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 185 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). All-wheel drive was also available. Owners generally appreciated the Kizashi's sharp handling, distinctive styling, and well-equipped interior. However, some common complaints revolved around the CVT transmission, relatively weak fuel economy for its class, and Suzuki's eventual departure from the US market, making parts availability a potential concern.
