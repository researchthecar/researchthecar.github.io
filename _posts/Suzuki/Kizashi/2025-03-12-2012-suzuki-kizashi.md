The 2012 Suzuki Kizashi is a mid-size sedan that aimed to offer a sporty driving experience and a premium feel at an affordable price. All models come with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine, producing 185 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque (180 hp and 160 lb-ft on AWD models). Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (FWD only) and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) available on both FWD and AWD models. Owners often praised the Kizashi for its nimble handling, comfortable ride, and unique styling. However, some disliked its relatively small back seat, limited cargo space, and the fact that Suzuki left the US market shortly after its release, making parts and service availability a potential concern.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 (J24B)**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to engine noise (rattling), misfires, poor performance, and potentially catastrophic engine damage. This is more prevalent on earlier model years but can occur on the 2012 as well.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. Inspecting and potentially replacing the camshaft phasers and other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Perform an oil consumption test to verify excessive consumption. Replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or potentially the entire engine may be necessary, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT can experience premature failure, resulting in slipping, hesitation, jerking, or complete loss of power. The CVT cooler line has also been known to leak.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT fluid, repairing or replacing the CVT cooler line, or replacing the entire CVT unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (cooler line repair) - $4000+ (CVT Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery can drain quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can be caused by parasitic draws from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw. Replacing the battery if it has been damaged by repeated draining.

**Summary**

The 2012 Suzuki Kizashi, while praised for its driving dynamics and styling, does have some common issues owners should be aware of. The most significant concern revolves around the CVT transmission, which can be expensive to repair or replace. Engine issues like timing chain problems and oil consumption also exist, though they may not be as widespread. Other issues, such as suspension and electrical problems, are relatively common for vehicles of this age. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major component replacements. Considering Suzuki's departure from the US market, sourcing parts and finding qualified mechanics may present additional challenges and potentially increase repair costs.
