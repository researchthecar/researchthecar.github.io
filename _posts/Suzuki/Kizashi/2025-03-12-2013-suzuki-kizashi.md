The 2013 Suzuki Kizashi is a mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling and relatively upscale interior for its price point. It came standard with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 185 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). People often appreciated the Kizashi's unique styling, comfortable ride, and nimble handling. Common complaints often centered around the CVT's performance, limited rear seat space, and the eventual difficulty of finding parts and service due to Suzuki's departure from the US market.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating and the need to add oil regularly.
    * Solution: Depending on the cause (worn valve seals, piston rings), the solution ranges from using a heavier weight oil to a complete engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (heavier oil) to $3,000+ (engine rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise, especially on cold start. Can lead to more serious engine damage if not addressed.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner and potentially the timing chain itself.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

* **CVT Failure/Shuddering**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Complete transmission failure in some cases.
    * Solution: CVT fluid change may alleviate minor shuddering. More severe cases require CVT replacement or rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) to $3,000+ (CVT replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Delayed Engagement**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or delay when shifting from park to drive or reverse.
    * Solution: CVT fluid change, valve body repair, or complete CVT replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) to $3,000+ (CVT replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. Can lead to a rougher ride and decreased handling performance.
    * Solution: Replacement of rear shocks or springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise when driving over bumps.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits for a few days. This can make it difficult to start the car.

**Summary**

The 2013 Suzuki Kizashi, while appreciated for its handling and style, has potential issues that buyers should be aware of. The CVT transmission is a significant concern, with potential for shuddering and failure, leading to costly repairs. Oil consumption and timing chain issues in the engine can also add up. Suspension and electrical problems are less severe but still worth noting. The cost of repairs can vary widely, but the CVT issues, in particular, can be expensive to address. Potential buyers should have a mechanic inspect the car before purchasing, especially focusing on the transmission's condition.
