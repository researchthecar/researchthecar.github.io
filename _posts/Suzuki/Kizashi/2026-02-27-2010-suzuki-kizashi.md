### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Suzuki Kizashi presents a mixed reliability picture. The 2.4L engine, while generally robust, can exhibit oil consumption issues and problems with the VVT actuator. The CVT transmission is more prone to issues like hesitation and jerking, often requiring software updates or more significant repairs. The manual transmission appears to be a more reliable choice. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment and keyless entry systems, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components are generally considered reliable, with no widespread common failures reported. Owners should be diligent with oil level checks and be aware of potential transmission quirks.
