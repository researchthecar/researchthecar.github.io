**Summary**

The 2002 Suzuki Esteem, while an affordable and fuel-efficient vehicle, can suffer from several common issues. Engine problems like sensor failures and gasket leaks, along with transmission issues like harsh shifting, can lead to moderate repair costs. Suspension issues contribute to driving discomfort, and electrical problems like power window and alternator failures can be frustrating. Rust, especially in regions with road salt, can also be a significant concern. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, especially if they involve transmission work or body repair.
