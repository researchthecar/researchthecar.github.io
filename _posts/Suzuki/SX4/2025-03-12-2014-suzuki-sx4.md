The 2014 Suzuki SX4 is a compact car available as a hatchback or sedan. It offers a practical and fuel-efficient driving experience. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. It's available with either a 6-speed manual or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). People often appreciate the SX4's affordability, available all-wheel drive, and maneuverability. However, some common dislikes include its somewhat dated interior, modest power, and limited cargo space compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating or the engine running rough due to low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Regularly check oil levels and top off as needed. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic should inspect for leaks, worn piston rings, or valve stem seals. Engine rebuild or replacement may be required in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (top off oil); $100 - $300 (leak repair); $2,000 - $5,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission has been reported to be prone to failure. Symptoms include slipping, hesitation, jerking, and a lack of response to throttle inputs. In some cases, the transmission may fail completely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT is often the only solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the rear shock absorbers. Clunking noises from the rear suspension, bouncy ride, and reduced handling stability.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight, even when the car is off. This is due to an electrical component not shutting down fully.
    *   Solution: Conduct a parasitic draw test to identify the circuit responsible for the excessive drain. Possible culprits include the radio, HVAC system, or body control module. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle can begin to rust along the rocker panels and wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Welding and painting of the rusted areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The A/C system stops blowing cold air. This can be due to a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a failed A/C condenser.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the problem and repair or replace the faulty component. This may involve recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, condenser, or other A/C components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 (recharge refrigerant); $400 - $1000+ (compressor/condenser replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Suzuki SX4 can be a decent option for a fuel-efficient compact car. However, it's essential to be aware of the potential issues, particularly the CVT transmission failures, and the potential for excessive oil consumption. Repair costs can range from relatively minor (battery drain, shock replacement) to quite significant (CVT replacement, engine rebuild), making a thorough pre-purchase inspection crucial. The rusting issues are also a concern, especially in areas with road salt use.
