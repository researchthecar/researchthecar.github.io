**Introduction:**

The 2013 Suzuki SX4 is a compact hatchback and sedan available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-four and a 1.6-liter inline-four. The 2.0-liter engine generates 150 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.6-liter engine produces 118 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The SX4 is praised for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency, and responsive handling, but it has been criticized for its lack of features and somewhat bland styling.
