**Summary**

The 2011 Suzuki SX4, while affordable and practical, has several common issues to watch out for. The most concerning are potential CVT transmission failures, which can be costly to repair or replace. Other problems include excessive oil consumption, timing chain issues, ABS sensor failure, wheel bearing failure, power window failure, rust issues, and airbag clockspring issues. While some of these issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, making it important to have a used SX4 thoroughly inspected before purchase. The CVT is likely the most severe issue due to high repair costs.
