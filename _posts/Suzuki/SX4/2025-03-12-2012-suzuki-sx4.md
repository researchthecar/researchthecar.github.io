The 2012 Suzuki SX4 is a compact car available as a hatchback or sedan, offering a blend of practicality and affordability. Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a CVT. All-wheel drive was available on some models. Owners often appreciate the SX4's value, fuel efficiency, and available all-wheel drive, but some dislike its small size and somewhat dated interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms may include the need to add oil every few thousand miles, bluish exhaust smoke (though not always), and eventually, potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is crucial. Some have had success with switching to a higher viscosity oil. In more severe cases, engine repair or replacement may be necessary, potentially involving piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or stretching of the timing chain can occur. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on cold starts. If left unaddressed, this can lead to engine damage and potential failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and guides is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission can experience premature failure. Symptoms include slipping, hesitation, jerking, rough shifting, inability to accelerate, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: In most cases, complete transmission replacement is the only viable solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of rear wheel bearings. Symptoms include a grinding or humming noise from the rear of the vehicle that increases with speed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty wheel bearing(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors can fail, causing the TPMS warning light to illuminate even when tire pressures are correct.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty TPMS sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per sensor (including installation)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, or operating intermittently, due to motor failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is the ideal solution, but is often cost-prohibitive. Dashboard covers are a cheaper alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Upholstery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory seat upholstery is known to be cheap, thin, and tear easily with normal usage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the seat upholstery, or installation of seat covers is the best solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners in areas with road salt usage report premature rusting, particularly around the wheel wells and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair and prevention measures, such as rust inhibitors and regular washing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Suzuki SX4 can be a reliable and affordable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the CVT transmission and engine issues like oil consumption and timing chain problems. Electrical and suspension issues, while less severe, are also worth noting. Pre-purchase inspections are recommended to assess the vehicle's condition and address any potential issues proactively. The cost to fix these issues can vary widely, with transmission replacements being the most expensive.
