The 2016 Suzuki Ciaz is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and affordability. Engine options typically included a 1.4-liter K14B petrol engine producing around 91 horsepower and 96 lb-ft of torque, often paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some regions may have also offered a 1.3-liter diesel engine. Drivers generally appreciate the Ciaz for its comfortable ride and value for money, but some criticisms include its somewhat underwhelming engine performance and basic interior features.

**Engine**

**1.4L K14B Petrol Engine**

* **Excessive Engine Noise/Ticking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of excessive engine noise, specifically a ticking or knocking sound, especially noticeable during cold starts or idle. The noise may diminish as the engine warms up but can return under load.
    * Solution: Diagnosis typically involves checking the valve train (lifters, rockers, valve clearances). Adjusting valve clearances or replacing worn lifters might be necessary. An engine flush may also help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the parts needed and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rough Idle/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine exhibiting a rough or unstable idle, sometimes accompanied by hesitation during acceleration. This could be related to issues with the fuel injectors or the Mass Airflow (MAF) sensor.
    * Solution: Diagnose and clean or replace faulty fuel injectors. Clean the MAF sensor or replace it if cleaning doesn't resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported instances of delayed gear shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or harsh, jerky shifting. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter replacement might resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, valve body issues or solenoid problems may necessitate a rebuild or replacement of the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) to $1500+ (rebuild or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear in suspension bushings, particularly in the front control arms. Symptoms include clunking noises during bumps, wandering steering, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Inspect all suspension bushings for cracks or excessive play. Replace worn bushings or, in some cases, the entire control arm assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per side, depending on the extent of the damage and whether individual bushings or entire control arms are replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Malfunctioning Power Windows/Locks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent operation or complete failure of power windows or door locks. This can affect individual windows/locks or multiple components simultaneously.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty switch or motor related to the affected window or lock. Replacement of the switch or motor is often required. Check the wiring harness for damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per window/lock, depending on the component needing replacement and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rusting Around the Trunk/Boot Lid**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of rust developing around the edges of the trunk/boot lid, especially in areas with high humidity or road salt exposure.
    * Solution: Sand down the affected area to remove rust, apply rust inhibitor, and repaint. In severe cases, panel replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the extent of the rust.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking (in hot climates)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in regions with high temperatures and intense sunlight.
    * Solution: Use a dashboard protectant, repair with filler and paint, or replace the entire dashboard.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+ depending on the method and extent of damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Suzuki Ciaz generally experiences issues that are manageable, although some may become costly if neglected. Engine noise and transmission shift issues are common, but may be solved with regular maintenance and fluid changes. Suspension bushing wear can be mitigated with regular inspections and prompt replacement. Electrical issues are less frequently reported but can occur. Rust around the trunk lid is a consideration, especially in regions prone to corrosion. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially requiring a few hundred dollars or more to repair.
