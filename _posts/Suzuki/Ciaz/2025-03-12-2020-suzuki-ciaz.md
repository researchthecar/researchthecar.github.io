The 2020 Suzuki Ciaz is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and affordability. It is typically powered by a 1.5-liter K15B inline-four gasoline engine producing around 104 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its comfortable ride and practical features, while others find its engine performance and dated transmission options to be underwhelming.
