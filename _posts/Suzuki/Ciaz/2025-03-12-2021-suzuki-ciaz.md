The 2021 Suzuki Ciaz is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and spacious interior, especially for its class. In many markets, it comes equipped with a 1.5-liter K15B inline-four gasoline engine producing around 103 horsepower and 101 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Ciaz for its affordability and comfortable ride, while others find the engine performance adequate but not particularly exciting, and the older 4-speed automatic transmission can feel dated.
