The 2012 Suzuki SX4 Crossover is a compact hatchback with available all-wheel drive, offering a blend of practicality and affordability. The engine option for this model year is a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 150 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the SX4 Crossover for its all-weather capability (with AWD), nimble handling, and value. Common criticisms include limited rear passenger space, a somewhat dated interior, and relatively low fuel economy compared to other compact cars.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.0L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning light illumination, engine knocking or rattling (especially at start-up), and visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the cause. Initially, check for external oil leaks around the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. If no leaks are found, the issue may be internal, such as worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose internal issues. Replacing the faulty components is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the severity and the required repair â€“ leak fixes being less expensive than engine rebuilds).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the timing chain stretching or failing, leading to engine misfires and poor performance. Symptoms can include a rattling noise from the engine, especially at startup, as well as the check engine light illuminating with codes related to timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced premature failure of the CVT transmission. Symptoms can include slipping, jerking, hesitation during acceleration, unusual noises (whining or buzzing), and the transmission failing to engage gears.
    *   Solution: In most cases, a full transmission replacement is required. In some cases, a rebuild may be possible, but this depends on the extent of the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+ (replacement); $1500 - $3000 (rebuild, if possible)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Shudder/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report shuddering or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change using the correct OEM fluid may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid change); $800 - $1500 (valve body)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported the rear suspension sagging over time, leading to reduced ride height, especially when carrying passengers or cargo. This can result in a harsher ride and decreased handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs and/or shocks. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs can help prevent future sagging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the front strut mounts can occur. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the power window regulators or motors, causing windows to become slow to operate, inoperative, or to fall down into the door.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window regulator and/or motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Airbag Warning Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminating on the dashboard. This could indicate a fault in the airbag system, potentially compromising its functionality in the event of a collision.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the underlying issue (e.g., faulty sensor, wiring issue) using a diagnostic scan tool, followed by repair or replacement of the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in Rust-Prone Areas)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the undercarriage, body panels, and around the wheel wells, especially in regions with heavy salt usage during winter.
    *   Solution: Rust repair and prevention, including sanding, priming, painting, and application of rust inhibitors. In severe cases, panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive), installation of a dashboard cover, or repair using specialized vinyl repair products.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (dash cover) or $1000+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Suzuki SX4 Crossover can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of certain common issues. The most concerning is the potential for CVT transmission failure, which can be a costly repair. Excessive oil consumption and timing chain issues are other engine-related problems to watch out for. Suspension sagging and electrical problems like power window failures are less severe but still common complaints. Rust can also be a concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Overall, while many SX4 Crossovers provide reliable service, a thorough inspection and maintenance history review are crucial before purchasing a used model. The most expensive problems, such as CVT failure, can be significant.
