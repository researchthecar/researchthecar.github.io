**Introduction:**
The 2009 INFINITI G37 is a luxury sport coupe and sedan that offers a balance of performance, style, and technology. Available with a 3.7-liter V6 engine mated to a 6-speed manual or 7-speed automatic transmission, the G37 delivers impressive horsepower (330 hp for coupe, 328 hp for sedan) and torque (270 lb-ft for both). Despite its strengths, the G37 has been reported to experience certain issues.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**
* **Oil consumption issue:** Excessive oil consumption due to worn piston rings or valve stems. Symptoms include low oil levels, blue smoke from the exhaust, and decreased engine performance. Solution: Engine rebuild or replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
* **Intake manifold plenum crack:** The plastic intake manifold plenum can crack, causing air leaks and rough engine idling. Solution: Replace intake manifold plenum. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
* **Throttle body position sensor issue:** The throttle body position sensor can malfunction, causing erratic engine behavior, stalling, or reduced power. Solution: Replace throttle body position sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
* **Fuel pump failure:** The fuel pump can fail, leading to engine stalling or difficulty starting. Solution: Replace fuel pump. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Variable valve timing solenoid issue:** Faulty variable valve timing solenoids can cause engine performance issues, rough idling, and reduced fuel economy. Solution: Replace variable valve timing solenoids. Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic**
* **Harsh shifting:** Transmission may exhibit harsh or delayed shifting, especially during gear changes. Solution: Transmission fluid change, software update, or transmission overhaul. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
* **Slipping gears:** Transmission may slip or fail to engage gears properly. Solution: Transmission overhaul or replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
* **Transmission control module failure:** The transmission control module can malfunction, causing shifting problems or transmission failure. Solution: Replace transmission control module. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter may shudder or vibrate during gear changes. Solution: Replace torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
* **Differential bearing failure:** The differential bearings can fail, causing noise or vibration from the rear of the vehicle. Solution: Replace differential bearings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front lower control arm bushings:** Worn front lower control arm bushings can cause clunking noises and poor handling. Solution: Replace control arm bushings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Rear trailing arm bushings:** Worn rear trailing arm bushings can lead to rear suspension instability and noise. Solution: Replace trailing arm bushings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+
* **Shock absorber failure:** Worn or damaged shock absorbers can affect handling and ride quality. Solution: Replace shock absorbers. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
* **Strut mount bearing failure:** Failed strut mount bearings can cause noise and vibration during suspension travel. Solution: Replace strut mount bearings. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Sway bar link failure:** Worn or broken sway bar links can compromise handling and stability. Solution: Replace sway bar links. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain issue:** The vehicle may experience excessive battery drain when parked. Solution: Diagnose and repair electrical components causing the drain. Estimated Cost to Fix: Variable, depending on the source of the drain
