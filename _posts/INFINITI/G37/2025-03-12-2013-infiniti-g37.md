The 2013 INFINITI G37 is a sporty and luxurious coupe, sedan, and convertible. It's praised for its responsive handling, powerful engine, and stylish design. However, it is also criticized for having a somewhat dated interior and lower fuel economy than some competitors. The G37's standard engine is a 3.7-liter V6 (VQ37VHR) producing 328-330 horsepower and 269-270 lb-ft of torque, depending on the trim. Transmission options include a 7-speed automatic and a 6-speed manual (available only on certain trims).

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This issue can be more prevalent in vehicles with higher mileage. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently than expected, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential low oil pressure warnings.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is crucial. For severe cases, a compression test and leak-down test can help identify the source of the leak. Potential solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or, in extreme cases, engine replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve stem seal replacement $1,000 - $2,000+. Piston ring replacement $3,000 - $5,000+. Engine Replacement $5,000 - $8,000+
