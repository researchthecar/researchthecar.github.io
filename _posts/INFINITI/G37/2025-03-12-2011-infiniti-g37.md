The 2011 INFINITI G37 is a popular luxury sports sedan, coupe, and convertible known for its responsive handling, powerful engine, and attractive styling. The G37 is powered by a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 328 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. Engine is mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the G37's performance and engaging driving experience. However, some common complaints include a somewhat firm ride, dated infotainment system, and higher fuel consumption compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.7L VQ37VHR V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some G37 owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may manifest as the low oil level warning light illuminating or the need to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles. This can lead to premature wear of engine components if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels and adding oil as needed can help mitigate the risk of damage. A leak-down test can help determine the extent of the issue. In severe cases, engine repairs or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil change) - $5,000+ (engine replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from the valve cover gaskets as they age. This can result in oil drips on the exhaust manifold, producing a burning oil smell. Visible oil around the valve covers is another symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets is the standard repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (RE7R01A)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough shifting, delayed engagement, or slipping gears, particularly at lower speeds. These symptoms can be indicative of problems within the valve body, which controls fluid pressure and gear selection.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild, or a full transmission replacement. A transmission fluid flush *might* resolve the issue, but usually replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Differential Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn rear differential bushings can cause clunking noises, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Vibrations may also be felt in the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear differential bushings with OEM or aftermarket options.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn or torn control arm bushings can lead to imprecise handling, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$800+ depending on how many bushings are replaced and if the full control arm needs replaced or just the bushings

**Electrical**

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing devices, intermittent disconnections, or poor audio quality during Bluetooth calls.
    *   Solution: Software updates, resetting the Bluetooth module, or replacing the module in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software update) - $300+ (Module Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation System Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may freeze, become unresponsive, or display error messages. This can be due to software glitches or hardware failures within the navigation unit.
    *   Solution: Attempting a system reset or software update. If the problem persists, the navigation unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (System Reset) - $1,000+ (Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks may fail to lock or unlock properly, either manually or with the key fob. This is often caused by a faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Heater Core**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heater core can leak and fail, resulting in a lack of heat or coolant smell inside of the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replace the heater core.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 INFINITI G37, while known for its performance and styling, can experience a range of issues. Engine oil consumption, valve body problems in the automatic transmission, and suspension bushing wear are among the more commonly reported problems. Electical issues with bluetooth and the navigation system are also known. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others like engine or transmission work can be costly.
