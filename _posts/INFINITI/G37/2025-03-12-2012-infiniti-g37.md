The 2012 INFINITI G37 is a popular luxury sports sedan known for its performance and stylish design. It was available with a 3.7-liter V6 engine (VQ37VHR) producing 328 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque, and either a 7-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission (available only on the G37 Coupe and Sedan). Owners appreciate the G37 for its responsive handling, powerful engine, and upscale interior. Common complaints include the car's somewhat firm ride, road noise, and fuel economy that isn't the best.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6 (VQ37VHR)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Some owners report needing to add a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust upon start-up or acceleration.
    *   Solution: There isn't a single definitive fix. Some owners have had success with switching to a different viscosity of oil, while others have had to replace the piston rings or even the entire engine in severe cases. A compression test can help determine the extent of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold start-up that lasts for a few seconds. This is often caused by the timing chain tensioner losing pressure and allowing the chain to slack.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner and, in some cases, the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
