**Summary**

The 2008 INFINITI G37, while generally reliable, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The timing chain issues and potential for oil consumption on the 3.7L V6 engine are perhaps the most significant concerns, potentially leading to costly repairs. Transmission problems, particularly with the 5-speed automatic, can also be expensive. Other issues, such as suspension noises and electrical malfunctions, are generally less severe but still worth noting. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
