The 2010 INFINITI G37 is a popular luxury sports sedan, coupe, and convertible known for its performance and styling. It is equipped with a 3.7-liter V6 engine (VQ37VHR) that produces 328 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate the car's responsive handling, powerful engine, and upscale interior. However, some common complaints include higher than average fuel consumption, some reliability concerns, and relatively firm ride quality. This model year comes with either a 7-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission, each with their own set of potential issues.

**Engine**

**3.7L VQ37VHR V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs. Some owners have reported consuming a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with using thicker oil, but a more permanent solution often involves replacing the piston rings. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and the shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gallery Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the gallery gaskets (paper gaskets that supply oil to the valve timing system), leading to low oil pressure, VVEL (Variable Valve Event and Lift) malfunction, and potential engine damage. Symptoms can include rough idle, loss of power, and engine noise.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the gallery gaskets with updated metal gaskets. This is a labor-intensive job requiring disassembly of the front of the engine.

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, as well as clunking and banging noises while shifting gears.
