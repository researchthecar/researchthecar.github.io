The 2009 Infiniti M35 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its blend of performance and comfort. It came with two engine options: a 3.5L V6 and a 4.5L V8. The 3.5L V6 engine produced around 270 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the M35's stylish design, comfortable interior, and strong acceleration. Common dislikes include the dated technology, fuel economy, and some reliability concerns, especially as the cars age.
