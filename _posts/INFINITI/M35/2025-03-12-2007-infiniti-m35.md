The 2007 INFINITI M35 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its blend of performance, comfort, and technology. It came with two engine options: a 3.5-liter V6 (VQ35DE) producing 275 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque and a 4.5-liter V8 (VK45DE) producing 325 horsepower and 336 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the car's stylish design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience. Common dislikes include the sometimes-unreliable electronics, higher maintenance costs, and slightly dated technology compared to newer models.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. Can lead to reduced engine performance and, in severe cases, engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs. This can lead to decreased performance, fouled spark plugs, and catalytic converter damage if left unaddressed.
    * Solution: There are several possible causes including PCV valve failure, valve stem seal failure, and worn piston rings. A compression test and leak-down test can help pinpoint the issue. Depending on the cause, repairs can range from replacing the PCV valve to an engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**4.5L V8 (VK45DE)**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the V6, the V8 can suffer from excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be observed.
    * Solution: Investigate potential causes such as PCV valve issues, valve stem seal wear, or piston ring issues. Depending on the cause, repairs can range from PCV valve replacement to an engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (RE5R05A)**

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly. Can also trigger the check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. In some cases, flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the solenoids within the valve body can resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially when accelerating. May also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension when going over bumps, uneven tire wear, and vague steering feel.
    * Solution: Replacement of the front lower control arms. Bushings can sometimes be replaced individually, but replacing the entire control arm is often recommended for ease of repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll during cornering.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ for both
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Bluetooth Module Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bluetooth connectivity issues, inability to pair devices, or system malfunctions.
    * Solution: Replacement of the Bluetooth module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Navigation System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, map errors, or complete system failure.
    * Solution: Software update (if available), or replacement of the navigation unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    * Solution: Removing the headlights and drying them out. Sealing any cracks or leaks in the housing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof fails to open or close properly, makes grinding noises, or leaks water.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, tracks, or seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 INFINITI M35, while a comfortable and stylish luxury sedan, has several common issues to be aware of. The engine and transmission can exhibit problems such as timing chain tensioner failure, oil consumption, valve body issues, and torque converter failure, potentially leading to costly repairs. Suspension issues like control arm bushing and shock absorber failures can affect ride quality and handling. Electrical problems with the Bluetooth module and navigation system can be frustrating. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission work, can be quite costly. Overall, potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
