### Summary Verdict
The 2007 INFINITI M35 is generally considered a reliable luxury sedan, particularly with its well-regarded 3.5L V6 engine. Common issues tend to be related to age and mileage, such as oil and coolant leaks from gaskets and hoses, and potential wear in suspension components like ball joints and struts. The 7-speed automatic transmission has seen some reports of harsh shifting, which may require attention.

While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential maintenance points to keep the M35 in good running order. Regular fluid changes and inspections are recommended.
