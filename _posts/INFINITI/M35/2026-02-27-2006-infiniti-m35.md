### Summary Verdict
The 2006 INFINITI M35 is a capable luxury sedan with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the engine's ancillary components (oil and coolant leaks) and the automatic transmission's shifting behavior, which can sometimes require attention. Electrical gremlins, particularly with power windows and instrument clusters, are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. While not overwhelmingly problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection to assess their condition.
