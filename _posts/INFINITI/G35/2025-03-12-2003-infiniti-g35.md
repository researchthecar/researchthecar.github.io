The 2003 Infiniti G35 is a popular sports sedan and coupe known for its engaging driving dynamics, stylish design, and relatively affordable price point. It came equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (VQ35DE) producing around 260-280 horsepower and 260-270 lb-ft of torque, depending on the trim level. The engine was paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the G35's sporty handling, comfortable interior, and distinctive exhaust note. However, common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly regarding oil consumption, electrical components, and suspension wear.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, often requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if left unaddressed. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings and valve stem seals can address the issue, although it is an extensive and costly repair. Sometimes just replacing the PCV valve can help mitigate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft position sensor fails, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, stalling, and difficulty starting the engine. The check engine light will likely illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor fails, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, stalling, and difficulty starting the engine. The check engine light will likely illuminate.

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, shifts harshly, or fails to engage properly. This can be caused by worn-out clutch packs, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and fluid change might temporarily alleviate the issue. More severe cases might require valve body repair or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clutch wears out prematurely or fails, leading to slipping, difficulty shifting, or an inability to engage gears.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. Resurfacing or replacing the flywheel may also be necessary.

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings cause clunking noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps or during braking. The vehicle may also exhibit poor handling and uneven tire wear.
