*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings, and potentially engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and potential repairs such as valve cover gasket replacement, piston ring replacement (more involved and expensive), or PCV valve replacement to address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ depending on the cause and repair.

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially in colder weather. This is due to the timing chain tensioner not maintaining proper tension on the timing chain.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This is often caused by wear and tear on the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, or a burning smell. This indicates the clutch disc is worn and needs replacement.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing.  Resurfacing or replacement of the flywheel is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lower Control Arm Bushings Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Can also lead to imprecise steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front lower control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Reduced ride quality, excessive bouncing, and visible fluid leaks from the rear shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Electrical**

*   **Fuel Gauge Inaccuracy**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Fuel gauge showing inaccurate readings, either higher or lower than the actual fuel level in the tank.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel level sending unit (part of the fuel pump assembly).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**

In summary, the 2008 INFINITI G35 is a generally reliable vehicle but it is not without its issues. Common problems include oil consumption, timing chain tensioner issues, torque converter problems with the automatic transmission, suspension wear, and some electrical glitches. While some of these issues can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like engine oil consumption, can lead to more significant repair costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic before purchasing.
