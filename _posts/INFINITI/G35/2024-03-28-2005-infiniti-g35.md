**Introduction**

The 2005 INFINITI G35 is a compact luxury sedan that was offered with three engine options: a 2.5-liter V6, a 3.5-liter V6, and a 3.8-liter V6. The 2.5-liter V6 produced 215 horsepower and 187 lb-ft of torque, the 3.5-liter V6 produced 280 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.8-liter V6 produced 298 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. All three engines were available with a 6-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission. The G35 was praised for its handling, performance, and interior quality, but some owners have reported problems with certain components.
