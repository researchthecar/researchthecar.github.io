**Summary**

The 2007 INFINITI G35 is generally a reliable vehicle, but it's not without its issues. Engine problems, such as intake manifold gasket failure and oil consumption, are the most common and can be costly to repair. Transmission issues can also be expensive, with the 5-speed automatic transmission being more prone to problems than the 6-speed manual.
