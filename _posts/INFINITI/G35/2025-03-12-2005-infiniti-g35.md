The 2005 Infiniti G35 is a popular sports sedan known for its performance, handling, and stylish design. It came with two engine options: a 3.5L V6 producing either 260 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (sedan) or 280 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque (coupe), and a higher-output 3.5L V6 rated at 298 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (Coupe Rev-Up Package). Transmission choices include a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual. Owners appreciate the G35's sporty driving experience and value, but common complaints include premature brake wear, oil consumption, and electrical issues.

**Summary:**

The 2005 Infiniti G35, while a sporty and enjoyable vehicle, has several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant problems revolve around oil consumption, particularly in the Rev-Up engine, and transmission issues, especially with the automatic. Suspension components are also prone to wear.  While some repairs are relatively inexpensive (e.g., window motor replacement), others like engine rebuilds or transmission replacements, can be very costly. Buyers should carefully inspect potential purchases for these issues, especially oil consumption, and factor potential repair costs into their budget.
