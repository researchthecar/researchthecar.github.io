The 2007 INFINITI G35 is a sporty and luxurious sedan known for its performance and stylish design. It was offered with a 3.5L V6 engine in two different tunes: the standard version producing around 275 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque, and a higher-output version (found in the G35 Coupe and Sport models) producing around 306 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed automatic and a 6-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the G35's handling, acceleration, and upscale interior.
