The 2007 INFINITI FX35 is a mid-size luxury crossover known for its sporty handling and distinctive styling. It was available with two engine options: a 3.5-liter V6 (VQ35DE) producing 275 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.5-liter V8 (VK45DE) in the FX45. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the FX35's performance, comfortable interior, and unique design. Some common criticisms include below average fuel economy, some cheap interior trim, and higher than average maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, visible smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: The most common solution is to closely monitor oil levels and add oil as needed. In some cases, switching to a higher viscosity oil may help reduce consumption. For more severe cases, engine repairs or replacement of piston rings may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ depending on the severity and chosen repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The camshaft position sensor may fail, leading to rough running, stalling, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty camshaft position sensor is typically the fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**4.5L V8 (VK45DE)**

No Issues Found.

**Transmission**

* **5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 5-speed automatic transmission, including slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifting, and difficulty engaging gears. These issues can be more pronounced at higher mileage.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement can resolve minor issues. However, more serious problems may require transmission repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Worn or damaged front struts can lead to poor handling, a bouncy ride, and excessive noise from the front suspension.
    * Solution: Replacing the front struts is the common repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with rear air suspension may experience issues with the air springs leaking or the air compressor failing. This can lead to the rear of the vehicle sagging or failing to maintain proper ride height.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty air springs or air compressor is the typical fix. Some owners opt to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per air spring, $500 - $1000+ for the compressor, $800+ for coil spring conversion.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component is necessary. Common culprits include the audio system, navigation system, and door lock actuators.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the draw.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Navigation Screen Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may fail or develop display issues, such as flickering or dimming.

    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can fail, causing the sunroof to get stuck open or closed, or to make excessive noise during operation.
    * Solution: Repairing or replacing the sunroof mechanism is the common solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators may fail, causing the doors to not lock or unlock properly.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator is the fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per actuator
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 INFINITI FX35, while a stylish and sporty SUV, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most concerning issues are related to excessive oil consumption in the V6 engine and potential transmission problems, both of which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, such as battery drain and navigation screen failures, can also be a source of frustration. While not every FX35 will experience these problems, it's essential to have a pre-purchase inspection performed and be prepared for potential maintenance costs. The air suspension on equipped models can also be a significant expense if problems arise. Overall, the FX35 is a fun-to-drive vehicle, but it's crucial to be aware of its potential weaknesses.
