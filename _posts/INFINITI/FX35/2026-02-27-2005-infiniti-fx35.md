### Summary Verdict
The 2005 INFINITI FX35 is a capable luxury SUV, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly concerning the VQ35DE engine's VVT system and oil seals, as well as the 5-speed automatic transmission's tendency for harsh shifting. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear over time. Electrical gremlins, such as window motor failures and instrument cluster problems, are also documented. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most common technical concerns beyond standard maintenance for this model year.
