### Summary Verdict
The 2009 INFINITI FX35 is a capable luxury crossover with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly its 3.5L V6 engine. The most commonly reported issues tend to revolve around the automatic transmission, specifically concerning shifting quality and potential solenoid failures, which can be costly to repair. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts can also wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and power accessory failures, are not uncommon.
