**Engine**

**3.5L VQ35HR V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to premature engine wear and potential damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly, performing oil consumption tests, and potentially replacing valve stem seals or piston rings in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and necessary repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. This is due to a failing timing chain tensioner that can lead to chain slap and potential engine damage if left unchecked.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission (RE7R01A)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or hesitation when accelerating. This can be caused by wear or failure within the valve body, which controls the hydraulic pressure that actuates the gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body. In some cases, flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the solenoids in the valve body can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially when accelerating from a stop, along with potential stalling. May be caused by the Torque Converter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter, and potentially the transmission if damage is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Bouncing excessively after hitting bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front struts and potentially the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per pair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the rear shock absorbers, leading to reduced damping and a bouncy ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per pair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response, screen glitches, or complete failure of the navigation/infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available), or replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits for a few days. This may be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve disconnecting accessories or replacing faulty modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate not opening or closing properly, often due to a failed motor or hydraulic struts.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate motor or hydraulic struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters failing to function or only working intermittently. This can be due to a broken heating element or a faulty switch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating element or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per seat.
    *   Recalls: None Found

In summary, the 2012 INFINITI FX35 exhibits a range of potential issues, with engine-related problems like oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failure being particularly concerning due to their potential for high repair costs. Transmission issues, such as valve body problems, can also be costly to address. Suspension, electrical, and interior issues are generally less severe but still contribute to the overall ownership experience. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and carefully inspect any used FX35 before purchase, paying particular attention to maintenance records and signs of these issues.
