**Engine**

**3.5L VQ35HR V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Some owners report needing to add a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the PCV valve can cause excess vacuum in the crank case leading to oil being sucked into the intake. Replacement of PCV valve and associated hoses may help. More severe cases may require engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100+ (PCV valve replacement) to $3,000 - $6,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise on startup, especially when cold. Can lead to engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioners, guides, and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, often with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420, P0430). Reduced engine performance and potential failure to pass emissions testing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (per converter)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild. Some owners have reported success with valve body cleaning and solenoid replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Poor handling and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front lower control arms or just the bushings themselves (if possible).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a few days, even with a new battery. Can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the parasitic draw. Common culprits include faulty door lock actuators, aftermarket alarm systems, or the BCM (Body Control Module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Gauge Inaccuracy**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel gauge reads inaccurately, either showing empty when the tank is still partially full or showing full when it's not.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel level sending unit or fuel pump assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate fails to open or close properly, or makes unusual noises. Can be due to a faulty motor, struts, or latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty component (motor, struts, or latch).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation Screen Failure/Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen either goes blank or develops a cloudy/peeling appearance due to delamination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the navigation screen or entire navigation unit.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 INFINITI FX35, while a stylish and sporty SUV, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The engine can suffer from oil consumption, timing chain issues, and catalytic converter failure. Transmission problems related to the valve body can also arise. Electrical issues like battery drain and fuel gauge inaccuracy are also possibilities. Suspension wear and tear is fairly normal on a vehicle of this age. Navigation screen failures and sunroof problems can add to the ownership cost. The severity and cost of these repairs can vary greatly, but being aware of these potential issues can help buyers make informed decisions.
