# 2018 INFINITI QX30

### Overview
The 2018 INFINITI QX30, a premium compact crossover, generally presents a respectable reliability profile, though not without its specific areas of concern. Built on a platform shared with Mercedes-Benz, it inherits some of that German engineering, which can be a double-edged sword. While many components are robust, certain electrical systems and powertrain elements have shown tendencies for issues that are worth noting for potential owners. The QX30 aims for a blend of sporty driving dynamics and luxury, and its reliability data reflects a vehicle that, for the most part, delivers on its promise, but requires attention to specific potential weak points.
