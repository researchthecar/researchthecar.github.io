The 2019 INFINITI QX30 is a subcompact luxury crossover that offered a blend of stylish design, comfortable ride, and agile handling, borrowing heavily from its Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class counterpart. It came standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine, producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. People often praise the QX30 for its distinctive exterior styling and upscale interior. Common criticisms include limited rear passenger space, a somewhat stiff ride on rough roads, and the infotainment system's dated interface.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. Symptoms may include low oil level warning lights and the need to frequently top off oil.
    *   Solution: There is not a single fix, but some have tried using different oil weights, or even replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the root cause and repair method chosen. Could range from $500 for minor repairs to $5,000+ for engine rebuilds.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission can exhibit harsh shifting, particularly at low speeds or during acceleration from a standstill. Some drivers have reported hesitation or jerky movements.
    *   Solution: The issue may be resolved by reflashing or reprogramming the Transmission Control Module (TCM) with updated software. In some cases, replacing the transmission fluid or the TCM may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500 for software updates, $200 - $400 for fluid changes, $500 - $1500+ for TCM replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing issues with rapid battery drain, even when the car is not in use. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: First step is to test the battery's voltage, and measure current draw. Second step is to identify parasitic draw sources, such as faulty sensors, modules, or aftermarket accessories. Replacing the affected components or repairing wiring issues can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for battery replacement, $100 - $500+ for diagnostic and repair of parasitic draw.

**Summary**

The 2019 INFINITI QX30 presents a mix of potential issues ranging from minor inconveniences to more significant mechanical concerns. The most concerning issue is the potential for excessive oil consumption, which can be costly to address. While the transmission complaints are prevalent, software updates or fluid changes may resolve them. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain can also be bothersome. Overall, a thorough inspection, particularly of the engine and transmission, is recommended before purchasing a used 2019 QX30.
