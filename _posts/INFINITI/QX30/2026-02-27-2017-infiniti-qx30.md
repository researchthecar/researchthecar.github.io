# 2017 INFINITI QX30

The 2017 INFINITI QX30, a compact luxury crossover, shares its platform with the Mercedes-Benz GLA. This shared architecture means some components and potential issues may mirror those found in its German counterpart. Overall, the QX30 is considered to have a decent reliability record for its class, though like any vehicle, it has specific areas that have seen more attention from owners. The powertrain, particularly the turbocharged engine, is generally robust, but some owners have reported minor electrical gremlins and occasional suspension noises. The interior and exterior components have also seen isolated reports of issues, though these are not widespread.
