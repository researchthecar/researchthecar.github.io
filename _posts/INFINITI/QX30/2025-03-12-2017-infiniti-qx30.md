The 2017 INFINITI QX30 is a compact luxury crossover known for its stylish design and comfortable ride. It is based on the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class platform, sharing many components. The standard engine is a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Some drivers appreciate its nimble handling and upscale interior, while others find its limited rear seat space and firm ride to be drawbacks.

**Engine**

    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause of the misfire (check engine codes) and replace the faulty component (spark plugs, ignition coil, or fuel injector).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the component and labor.

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have experienced harsh or jerky shifting, particularly at low speeds, as well as hesitation when accelerating. This can be related to the transmission control module (TCM) or issues with the dual-clutch system.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to reprogram or replace the TCM. In some cases, clutch replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+

**Suspension**

*   **Rough Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The QX30, particularly models with larger wheels, is known for having a somewhat firm and unforgiving ride. This can be noticeable on rough road surfaces.
    *   Solution: There's no simple fix for this, as it's a characteristic of the suspension tuning. Replacing the shocks/struts with a softer aftermarket option may help, but it could compromise handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ for aftermarket suspension components and installation.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
