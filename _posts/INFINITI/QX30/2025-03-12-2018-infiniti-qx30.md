The 2018 INFINITI QX30 is a compact luxury crossover based on the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class platform. It offers a blend of stylish design and a premium driving experience. The QX30 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.
