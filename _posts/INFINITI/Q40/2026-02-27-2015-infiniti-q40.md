# 2015 INFINITI Q40

### Overview
The 2015 INFINITI Q40, a compact luxury sedan, is largely based on the previous G37 model, inheriting much of its proven engineering. This lineage generally translates to good reliability, with owners reporting fewer significant mechanical issues compared to some competitors. The Q40 was offered with a robust V6 engine and a smooth automatic transmission, both of which are known for their durability when properly maintained. While no vehicle is entirely immune to problems, the Q40's core components have a solid track record. Common areas of concern, though infrequent, tend to be minor electrical glitches or wear on suspension components over time, typical for vehicles of this age and mileage.
