The 2017 INFINITI Q70 is a mid-size luxury sedan offering a blend of comfort, performance, and distinctive styling. Engine options for the 2017 Q70 include a 3.7-liter V6 producing 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, a 5.6-liter V8 generating 420 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid powertrain pairing a 3.5-liter V6 with an electric motor. All engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Q70's spacious interior, smooth ride, and powerful engine options, particularly the V8.

**Summary:**

The 2017 INFINITI Q70 presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical glitches to more significant engine and transmission concerns. The valve body problems in the 7-speed automatic transmission and the potential for timing chain tensioner failure in the 3.7L V6 are among the most prevalent and costly. Air suspension problems (if equipped) can also add to the ownership costs. Overall, while the Q70 offers a luxurious experience, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue and the shop performing the work.
