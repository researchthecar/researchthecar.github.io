The 2018 INFINITI Q70 is a mid-size luxury sedan offering a blend of performance and comfort. It was available with two engine options: a 3.7-liter V6 producing 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.6-liter V8 delivering 420 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Q70's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine options. Some common complaints include the dated infotainment system, smaller-than-average trunk space, and the lack of some advanced safety features compared to newer competitors.
