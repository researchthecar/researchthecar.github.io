The 2016 INFINITI Q70 is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a blend of comfort, performance, and technology. It comes with a choice of three engines: a 3.7-liter V6 producing 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, a 5.6-liter V8 generating 420 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid powertrain combining a 3.5-liter V6 with an electric motor for a combined output of 360 horsepower. All engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Q70's smooth ride, spacious interior, and powerful engine options. Common complaints include the dated infotainment system and smaller back seat than its competitors.

**Summary**

The 2016 INFINITI Q70 has some notable potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the timing chain on the 3.7L V6 and valve stem seals on the 5.6L V8, can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues like torque converter shudder and rough shifting are also potential concerns. Suspension problems, especially with the air suspension on equipped models, and electrical glitches with the infotainment system can be frustrating. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (seat heater failure) to significant (engine or transmission replacement), with repair costs varying widely. While not every Q70 will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of them and inspect vehicles carefully before purchasing.
