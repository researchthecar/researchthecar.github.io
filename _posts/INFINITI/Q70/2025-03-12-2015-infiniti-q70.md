The 2015 INFINITI Q70 is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a blend of comfort, performance, and style. Available engine options include a 3.7-liter V6 producing 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, a 5.6-liter V8 generating 420 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid powertrain that combines a 3.5-liter V6 with an electric motor for a total system output of 360 horsepower. All engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Q70 for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and powerful engine options. Common complaints include the somewhat dated infotainment system and lower fuel economy compared to competitors.
