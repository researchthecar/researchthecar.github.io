**Introduction**

The 1992 INFINITI G20 was a popular luxury compact sedan that offered a sleek and sporty design. It came with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The base engine was a 2.0-liter inline-four with 140 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine was a 2.0-liter V6 with 160 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque.
