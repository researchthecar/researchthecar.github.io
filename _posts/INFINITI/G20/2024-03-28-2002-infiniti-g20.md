**Introduction:**

The 2002 INFINITI G20 is a compact luxury sedan known for its sporty handling, stylish design, and comfortable interior. It was offered in two trim levels: the Base and the Sport. The Base model was powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine with 145 horsepower and 142 lb-ft of torque, while the Sport model featured a more powerful 3.5-liter V6 with 260 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a standard 5-speed manual transmission, with a 4-speed automatic transmission available as an option.

Owners of the INFINITI G20 have praised its sharp handling, responsive engines, and comfortable cabin. However, the vehicle has also been criticized for its lack of rear legroom, firm ride, and relatively high maintenance costs.
