**Introduction**

The 2000 INFINITI G20 is a compact luxury sedan that was available with two engine and transmission options. The 2.0-liter inline-four engine produced 145 horsepower and 137 lb-ft of torque, and could be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0-liter V6 engine produced 210 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque, and was paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission.

The G20 was praised for its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and powerful engines. However, it was also criticized for its cramped rear seat, lack of a navigation system, and mediocre fuel economy.
