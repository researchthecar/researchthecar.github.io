**1991 INFINITI G20**

The 1991 INFINITI G20 is a compact luxury sedan that was available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-four and a 3.0-liter V6. Both engines were paired with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The most serious issue is the timing belt failure, which can cause catastrophic engine damage if not addressed. Other issues, such as head gasket failure and transmission slipping, can also be expensive to repair. However, many of the other issues, such as strut mount failure and door handle failure, are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix.
