The 2000 Infiniti G20 is a compact luxury sedan known for its sporty handling and comfortable ride. It's powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine (SR20DE) producing 140 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the G20's nimble handling, reliable engine (when properly maintained), and overall value. Common dislikes include the relatively small rear seats, dated interior features, and potential for rust in certain climates.
