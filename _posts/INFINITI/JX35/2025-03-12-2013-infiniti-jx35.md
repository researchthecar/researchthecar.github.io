The 2013 INFINITI JX35, later renamed the QX60 in 2014, is a luxury crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. It offered a smooth driving experience, making it popular for families. However, some owners have reported issues with specific components. The JX35 was only offered with a 3.5L V6 engine producing 265 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Some common dislikes included the CVT's performance, particularly its responsiveness and perceived reliability, and the vehicle's fuel economy.

**Summary**

The 2013 INFINITI JX35 presents a mix of potential issues, with the CVT being the most concerning due to its potential for failure and high replacement cost.
