The 2013 INFINITI M56 is a luxury sedan known for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, and upscale features. The M56 offered two engine options: a 3.7-liter V6 (M37) and a 5.6-liter V8 (M56), both paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. The 5.6L V8 produces around 420 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the M56 for its performance and elegant styling, while some common complaints involve the infotainment system and potential for higher maintenance costs associated with a luxury vehicle.

**Engine**

**5.6L V8 (VK56VD)**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, especially on startup, can indicate a failing timing chain tensioner. This can lead to poor engine performance and, if left unchecked, potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

* **Direct Injection Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, and reduced fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs.
    * Solution: Depending on the severity, potential fixes range from valve seal replacement to piston ring replacement or even engine replacement. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the root cause.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and repair required)

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission (RE7R01A)**

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during light acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This is sometimes related to a failing torque converter.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

* **Valve Body Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, or slipping between gears can indicate a problem with the valve body.
    * Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1,500+

**Suspension**

* **Front Lower Control Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Worn lower control arm bushings are a common culprit.
    * Solution: Replacing the front lower control arm bushings or the entire control arm.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per side)

* **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks (if equipped with sport suspension)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dampened ride, clunking noises in the rear, and visible fluid leaks from the shock absorbers.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ (depending on the specific shocks and labor)

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits for a few days.
    * Solution: This can be due to a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory. Requires diagnosis to identify the source of the drain, which could be related to the BCM or any aftermarket electronics.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source and repair)

* **Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, or unresponsive touchscreen.
    * Solution: Software updates or replacement of the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+

**Interior**

* **Navigation Screen Delamination**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen delaminates, causing bubbling or peeling of the screen's surface.
    * Solution: Replacing the navigation screen or the entire head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2013 INFINITI M56, particularly the V8 model, offers impressive performance, but potential owners should be aware of some common issues. Engine-related problems like timing chain tensioner failure and fuel injector issues can be costly to address. Transmission problems such as torque converter and valve body problems may arise. Electrical problems can occur in addition to interior issues such as the navigation screen delaminating. While not every M56 will experience these problems, due diligence during inspection and maintenance is crucial. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major repairs, with costs potentially ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
