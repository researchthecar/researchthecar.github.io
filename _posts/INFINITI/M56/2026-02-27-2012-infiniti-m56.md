### Summary Verdict
The 2012 INFINITI M56 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, with a generally solid reliability record. The powerful 5.6L V8 engine is robust but can experience issues like oil consumption and timing chain wear, which are the most significant mechanical concerns to monitor. The 7-speed automatic transmission is mostly reliable but can develop shifting problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and intermittent battery drain, are also noted. While the suspension, exterior, and interior components are typically trouble-free, proactive maintenance and awareness of these specific potential issues will contribute to a more positive ownership experience.
