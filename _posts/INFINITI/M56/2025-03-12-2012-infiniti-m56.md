The 2012 INFINITI M56 is a luxury sedan that offers a blend of performance and comfort. It comes with two engine options: a 3.7-liter V6 producing 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.6-liter V8 producing 420 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the M56 for its powerful engine options, luxurious interior, and comfortable ride. Some common complaints include the complicated infotainment system and relatively poor fuel economy, especially with the V8 engine.

**Engine**

**5.6L V8 (VK56VD)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between regular service intervals. This can be indicated by low oil level warnings or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The exact cause varies, but potential solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or addressing issues with the PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the specific cause and extent of repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise on startup, especially when cold. This indicates the timing chain tensioner is failing to maintain proper tension, potentially leading to timing chain slippage or failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner, guides, and possibly the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.7L V6 (VQ37VHR)**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission (RE7R01A)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or complete failure to shift. Can sometimes be accompanied by error codes related to shift solenoids or valve body performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the valve body. Sometimes flushing the transmission and replacing the fluid can temporarily alleviate the issue, but often the valve body needs to be addressed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ depending on whether the valve body is repaired or replaced, and if the transmission needs to be removed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the car sagging or sitting lower than normal. The air compressor may run constantly or not at all. Error messages related to the air suspension system may be displayed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air struts or air springs, and possibly the air suspension compressor. Diagnosing and repairing leaks in the air lines is also important.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut depending on parts and labor. Replacing the compressor can add another $500-$1000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system may freeze, reboot unexpectedly, or display error messages. The touch screen may become unresponsive or inaccurate.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available) or replacement of the navigation/infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on whether a software update resolves the issue or the unit needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven for several days. This can result in difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve checking the alternator, starter, and various electrical components for shorts or excessive current draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain and the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Headlight Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlights may not turn on automatically when it is dark, or may turn on during the day.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the ambient light sensor or repair of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may not open or close properly, or it may make excessive noise when operating.
    * Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks, or replacing the sunroof motor or other damaged components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the severity of the problem.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing devices, dropped connections, or poor audio quality.
    * Solution: Software updates (if available), resetting the Bluetooth module, or replacing the Bluetooth module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $500+ depending on the cause and solution. Software updates are usually free.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2012 INFINITI M56, particularly models equipped with the 5.6L V8 engine, can experience some notable issues. The oil consumption and timing chain tensioner problems on the V8 can lead to expensive repairs. The 7-speed automatic transmission also shows a tendency to have issues with the valve body that can cause performance problems. The air suspension and electrical problems can also add up to expensive repairs. While the V6 model may be more reliable, any potential buyer should be aware of these common issues and inspect the vehicle carefully before purchase.
