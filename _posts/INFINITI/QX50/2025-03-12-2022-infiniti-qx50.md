The 2022 INFINITI QX50 is a compact luxury SUV powered by a 2.0-liter VC-Turbo inline-4 engine producing 268 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. This is the only engine option available for this model year. The engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The QX50 is appreciated for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and advanced technology features. However, some common criticisms include the performance and feel of the CVT transmission, the complex infotainment system, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L VC-Turbo Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage.
    *   Solution: INFINITI has released service bulletins and revised parts. Replacing the piston rings with an updated design has been reported as a fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature turbocharger failure has been reported, resulting in a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine bay (whining, screeching), and potentially illuminated check engine lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Shudder/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint is a shuddering or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds or when climbing hills. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to find the right gear ratio.
    *   Solution: A software update or transmission fluid change may temporarily alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, complete CVT replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 (fluid change), $150 - $300 (software update), $4,000 - $7,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a noticeable whining noise coming from the transmission, especially during acceleration. This noise can become more pronounced as the vehicle ages.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid change can help reduce the noise. If the noise persists or worsens, a CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 (fluid change), $4,000 - $7,000+ (CVT replacement)
