The 2021 INFINITI QX50 is a compact luxury crossover SUV known for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and innovative VC-Turbo engine. The QX50 comes exclusively with a 2.0-liter VC-Turbo inline-4 engine producing 268 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate the QX50's distinctive exterior styling and upscale interior, while some common criticisms include the CVT's behavior, particularly the lack of a traditional "gear shift" feel, and the complex VC-Turbo engine's long-term reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L VC-Turbo I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. In extreme cases, this can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Closely monitor oil levels and consult with a qualified mechanic to perform an oil consumption test. Potential fixes range from replacing PCV valves to more extensive engine repairs, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature turbocharger failures, indicated by loss of power, unusual noises from the engine bay (whining or whistling), and potentially check engine lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit and associated components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation and Jerky Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have complained about the CVT's behavior, particularly during acceleration from a stop or at low speeds. This manifests as hesitation, a feeling of "rubber banding," and jerky or uneven acceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can improve the CVT's responsiveness. However, for more severe cases, CVT replacement or repair may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update) - $5,000+ (CVT Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature CVT failure. Symptoms included slipping, shuddering, difficulty accelerating, and complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement or complete rebuild of CVT transmission
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported accelerated wear of suspension bushings, leading to clunking noises, degraded handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings or complete suspension arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In other cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,500+ (Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, and lane departure warning systems, may malfunction or provide false alerts.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor

**Summary**

The 2021 INFINITI QX50 presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from moderate to severe. The CVT transmission and VC-Turbo engine seem to be sources of the most significant concerns, with potential for costly repairs. Electrical system glitches and interior noise issues can also be bothersome. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history, pay close attention to the behavior of the CVT during a test drive, and be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with the complex engine and transmission systems.
