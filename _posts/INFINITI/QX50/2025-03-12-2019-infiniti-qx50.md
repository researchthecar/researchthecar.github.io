The 2019 INFINITI QX50 marked a significant redesign and the introduction of the VC-Turbo engine. This luxury crossover aimed to blend performance with efficiency, boasting a technologically advanced variable compression engine. The sole engine option available was the 2.0L VC-Turbo I4, producing 268 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. It was exclusively paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praised the QX50's stylish design, comfortable interior, and ample cargo space. However, the VC-Turbo engine's real-world fuel economy and the performance and responsiveness of the CVT were common points of criticism.

**Engine**

**2.0L VC-Turbo I4**

*   **Engine Vibration and Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive engine vibration and a rough idle, particularly at lower RPMs. This could be felt through the steering wheel and seats. Some attribute it to the complex variable compression mechanism or engine mounts.
    *   Solution: Dealers may attempt software updates to the engine control unit (ECU). In more severe cases, engine mount replacement or inspection of the variable compression system components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Turbo Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure, sometimes accompanied by loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling), and/or check engine lights.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation and Lack of Responsiveness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint involves the CVT exhibiting hesitation or sluggishness when accelerating, especially from a stop or during passing maneuvers. The engine may rev high without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control unit (TCU) may improve responsiveness. In some cases, a CVT fluid flush and refill might help. Severe cases may require CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software update) - $5,000+ (CVT replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a noticeable whining noise coming from the transmission, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. This is a common characteristic of CVTs, but can be excessive in some QX50s.
    *   Solution: Fluid check and possible fluid change to address wear and tear of the belt and pulley system. CVT replacement if the whining continues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$250 (fluid change) or $5,000+ (CVT replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **InTouch Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The InTouch infotainment system is known for being slow, glitchy, and prone to freezing. Connectivity issues with Bluetooth and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto are also common. The dual-screen setup can be confusing and distracting for some users.
    *   Solution: Software updates, if available, might improve performance. In some cases, replacing the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,500+ (Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions or false alarms from various sensors, such as the blind spot monitoring system or parking sensors. This can be intermittent or constant.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on location and type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Liftgate failing to open or close properly. Some owners have reported the liftgate randomly opening or closing unexpectedly.
    * Solution: Check and replace liftgate struts. Replace liftgate motor or control module if faulty.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+ for struts, $500-$1000+ for motor/module
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard and Door Panel Rattles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable rattling noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing the loose components. This may involve adding foam padding or tightening screws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the severity and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the sunroof or moonroof, including difficulty opening or closing, leaks, or unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the sunroof tracks, replacing seals, or repairing the motor mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the issue and parts required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 INFINITI QX50 presents a mixed bag of issues. The most concerning are the potential engine and transmission problems, which can be costly to repair. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions are also common annoyances. Interior rattles and sunroof problems, while less critical, can detract from the overall luxury experience. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to address, the potential for costly repairs related to the VC-Turbo engine and CVT transmission should be a significant consideration for potential buyers.
