The 2015 INFINITI QX50 is a compact luxury crossover SUV known for its sporty handling and comfortable ride. It comes with a single engine option: a 3.7-liter V6 engine that produces 325 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the QX50's responsive engine and agile handling. Some common complaints revolve around the limited rear passenger space and cargo capacity compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**3.7L VQ37VHR V6**

*   **Timing Chain Rattle/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, particularly on cold starts, is an early indicator of potential timing chain issues. In more severe cases, the engine may experience performance issues, misfires, or fail to start.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially the sprockets.

**Summary**

The 2015 INFINITI QX50 can be a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of some common issues, particularly those related to the engine timing chain and transmission.
