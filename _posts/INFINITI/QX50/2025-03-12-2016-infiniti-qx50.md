The 2016 INFINITI QX50 is a compact luxury SUV that was only offered with one engine and transmission option. It came with a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 325 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the QX50's sporty handling, powerful engine, and comfortable seats. However, some common complaints include a cramped rear seat, smaller cargo area compared to competitors, and outdated technology.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6 (VQ37VHR)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. The specific cause can vary, but may be related to piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause is essential. A compression test and leak-down test can help determine if the issue is with the piston rings or valve seals. Depending on the diagnosis, repairs may involve replacing the piston rings, valve seals, or both.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair, whether it requires a top-end or full engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. This is due to the timing chain tensioner not maintaining proper tension, which can lead to chain slap. Over time, if left unfixed, this can cause the timing chain to stretch or even break.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner. It's often recommended to replace the timing chain, guides, and sprockets at the same time to ensure a complete and reliable repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (RE7R01A)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough or harsh shifting, especially between certain gears. This may be more noticeable at lower speeds.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update can sometimes resolve the issue. In other cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 for fluid flush and software update; $800 - $2,000+ for valve body replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. This is often due to worn control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, or strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings or, in some cases, the entire control arm or sway bar link.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner (depending on the specific part and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car battery drains overnight or within a few days of non-use, requiring frequent jump starts. This could be caused by a parasitic draw.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves using a multimeter to identify the circuit causing the excessive draw. The faulty component, which could be anything from a door actuator to a faulty module, then needs to be replaced or repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1,000+ depending on the component that requires repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or unresponsive touchscreen. Difficulty connecting to Bluetooth. GPS malfunction.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the system. If that doesn't work, the system software may need to be updated or the unit replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for a software update, $500 - $2000+ for a replacement unit.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Headlight Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Automatic headlights fail to activate at night or randomly turn on/off during the day.
    * Solution: Replacing the ambient light sensor or headlight control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof won't open or close properly, gets stuck, or makes excessive noise.
    *   Solution: Often caused by debris in the sunroof tracks, requiring cleaning and lubrication. If the motor is failing, replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 for cleaning/lubrication, $300 - $800+ for motor replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters stop working or only heat intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating element or the seat heater control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2016 INFINITI QX50 has some known issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most concerning issues are related to the engine, particularly oil consumption and timing chain tensioner problems. Suspension bushings can also wear prematurely, leading to noise. Electrical problems with the battery drain and infotainment system are also common. While not all QX50s will experience these issues, it's important to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs.
