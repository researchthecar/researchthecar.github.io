The 2013 INFINITI M37 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its blend of performance, comfort, and stylish design. It was offered with two engine options: a 3.7-liter V6 and a 5.6-liter V8, each with a 7-speed automatic transmission. The 3.7-liter V6 produces around 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, offering a balance of power and efficiency. People generally liked the M37 for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and ample features. Some disliked its less-than-stellar fuel economy, somewhat dated infotainment system, and less engaging driving dynamics compared to some of its rivals.

**Summary**

The 2013 INFINITI M37 is a generally reliable car, but owners have reported issues with the timing chain on the 3.7L V6, valve body in the 7-speed automatic transmission, and suspension components, which may lead to moderate to high repair costs. Electrical issues with the navigation/infotainment system and battery drain can also occur. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to significant mechanical failures. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
