The 2012 INFINITI M37 is a luxury sedan that blends performance and comfort. It came with two engine options: a 3.7-liter V6 (330 hp, 270 lb-ft of torque) and a 5.6-liter V8 (420 hp, 417 lb-ft of torque) in the M56. Both engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the M37 for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience. However, some common complaints include electronic glitches, issues with the navigation system, and higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6 (VQ37VHR)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. This can sometimes be linked to worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: The problem may require engine disassembly, inspection, and replacement of worn parts like piston rings or valve stem seals. In severe cases, a short block replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially in colder weather. The noise usually subsides after the engine warms up. This indicates the timing chain tensioner isn't maintaining proper tension on the timing chain.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner, and potentially the timing chain itself if it has been worn due to the improper tension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**5.6L V8 (VK56VD)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced engine power, and potential stalling. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) indicating misfires on specific cylinders will likely be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement)

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (RE7R01A)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, and potential for the transmission to get stuck in a gear.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. A transmission flush and software update may sometimes alleviate the issue if caught early.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or making turns. Steering may feel loose or vague. Premature tire wear can also occur.
    * Solution: Replacement of the front lower control arms (often sold with bushings pre-installed).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may freeze, become unresponsive, or display incorrect information. The system may fail to boot up entirely.
    *   Solution: Software update (if available), replacement of the navigation system unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a short period, even when the car is not in use. Difficulty starting the car is a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic drain. This could involve testing and replacing faulty components such as relays, modules, or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)

*   **Failed Window Motor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more of the windows can no longer be controlled from the switch and they don't respond.
    *   Solution: The window motor needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight lens, causing reduced visibility and potential damage to the headlight assembly.
    *   Solution: Sealing the headlight housing or replacing the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+

**Interior**

*   **Seat Actuator Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power seats may not move forward, backward, up, down, or recline. This can be caused by a faulty seat motor.
    * Solution: Replacement of the seat actuator motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per seat

**Summary**

The 2012 INFINITI M37 has a few common issues to be aware of. Engine problems like oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failure, especially in the V6 models, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, particularly valve body issues, can also be expensive. Electrical problems, like navigation system glitches and battery drain, are less severe but can be frustrating. Overall, potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify and address any existing or potential issues.
