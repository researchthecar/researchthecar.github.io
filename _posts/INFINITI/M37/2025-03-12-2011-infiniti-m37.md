The 2011 INFINITI M37 is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a blend of performance and comfort. It was available with two engine options: a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.6-liter V8 engine (M56) with 420 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the M37 for its stylish design, powerful engine options, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated infotainment system, occasional reliability concerns, and higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles.
