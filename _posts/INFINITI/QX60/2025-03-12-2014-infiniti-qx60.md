The 2014 INFINITI QX60 is a luxury crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and relatively fuel-efficient performance. The standard engine option for the 2014 QX60 is a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 265 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate the QX60's smooth ride and family-friendly features, while others dislike the CVT's performance and reliability, as well as some reported electronic issues. A hybrid option was also available. This outline will focus on issues associated with the standard 3.5L V6 and its CVT transmission.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations on the engine, most commonly the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front timing cover. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. For more significant leaks, the timing cover may need to be resealed, which is a more labor-intensive process.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on the source of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converters are prone to failure, particularly at higher mileage. Symptoms include a check engine light with codes relating to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420, P0430), reduced engine performance, and a sulfur smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT is the most common source of complaints for the 2014 QX60. Symptoms include hesitation during acceleration, slipping, jerking, shuddering, whining noises, and complete transmission failure. Some owners have reported these issues at relatively low mileages.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the CVT may require a software update, a valve body replacement, or a complete replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (for software update/minor repair) to $4,000 - $8,000+ (for full replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the struts and shocks can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and unusual noises (clunking or squeaking) over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or damaged struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per axle (depending on whether you replace one or both sides at the same time)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Electrical issues with touch screen display**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported issues with the infotainment system freezing, glitching, or failing. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve the issue. However, often the unit must be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (e.g., Oxygen Sensors, Wheel Speed Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors can fail, leading to check engine lights and drivability issues. Common culprits include oxygen sensors (affecting fuel economy and emissions) and wheel speed sensors (affecting ABS and stability control).
    *   Solution: Replace the failed sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the automatic tailgate mechanism, resulting in the tailgate not opening or closing properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the tailgate motor or other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Navigation system freezes, incorrect routing, and general infotainment system unresponsiveness.
    *   Solution: Software update or replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AC system may blow warm air, have inconsistent cooling, or make unusual noises. Common causes include a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Repair the refrigerant leak, replace the compressor, or replace the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1200+ (depending on the component needing repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 INFINITI QX60, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, has several reported issues, with the CVT being the most significant concern. The potential for transmission failure poses a significant financial risk to owners. Other issues, such as oil leaks, electrical problems, and suspension component wear, are also relatively common. The severity and cost of repairs can vary greatly, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues before purchasing a used 2014 QX60.
