The 2024 INFINITI QX60 is a luxury mid-size SUV powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 295 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. It's generally praised for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology, while criticisms often focus on its fuel economy, somewhat uninspired driving dynamics, and the occasionally hesitant transmission. It aims to be a refined and comfortable family hauler, prioritizing luxury and convenience over sporty performance.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature timing chain wear and stretching leading to engine noise (rattling, especially on start-up), rough idling, decreased engine performance, and potential for check engine light activation (specifically codes related to camshaft/crankshaft correlation).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks developing from various engine seals, particularly around the valve covers and timing chain cover. Visible oil drips under the vehicle, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking seals and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough or jerky shifting, especially during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation or delays when shifting between gears, particularly when downshifting.
    *   Solution: Software update to the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, replacement of valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for software update), $1,500 - $3,000+ (for valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slipping or failing to engage properly, which can feel like a loss of power or a delay in acceleration. May be more pronounced when the engine is cold or under heavy load.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush. In some cases, replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (for fluid flush), $5,000 - $8,000+ (for transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (touchscreen, navigation, audio) sporadically freezing, becoming unresponsive, or rebooting unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Software update to the infotainment system. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200 (for software update), $1,000 - $3,000+ (for infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous alerts or complete failure of driver-assistance systems such as parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, or lane departure warning. Check engine light may be on.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the malfunctioning sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per sensor (depending on location and type)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from various interior trim panels, particularly in the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area. Often exacerbated by rough roads or temperature changes.
    *   Solution: Tightening or securing loose trim panels, applying felt tape or sound-deadening material to areas causing friction.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity and source of the noise)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof failing to open or close properly, sticking, or making excessive noise during operation. Water leaks around the sunroof seal.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the sunroof mechanism, adjustment of the sunroof track, or replacement of the sunroof seal. In severe cases, replacement of the entire sunroof assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300 (for lubrication/adjustment), $200 - $800 (for seal replacement), $1,000 - $3,000+ (for complete assembly replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 INFINITI QX60, while offering a luxurious experience, seems to exhibit some common issues. The engine has reported issues of timing chain wear and oil leaks, while the transmission suffers from harsh shifting/hesitation and slippage. Electrically, the infotainment system and sensors can have issues. The interior has rattling noises and the sunroof has shown issues as well. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like timing chain or transmission replacement, can be quite costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, paying close attention to vehicle history and performing thorough inspections.
