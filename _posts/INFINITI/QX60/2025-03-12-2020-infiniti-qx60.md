The 2020 INFINITI QX60 is a mid-size luxury SUV that offers a comfortable ride and spacious interior, making it a popular choice for families. However, it's important to be aware of potential issues that owners have reported. The QX60 came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 295 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Common likes include the QX60's comfortable ride, spacious third-row seating, and upscale interior. Common dislikes include the sometimes sluggish performance of the CVT, the somewhat dated infotainment system, and fuel economy that isn't class-leading.
