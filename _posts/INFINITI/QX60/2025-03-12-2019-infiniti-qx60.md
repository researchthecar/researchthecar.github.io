The 2019 INFINITI QX60 is a luxury crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior (especially its third-row seating), and upscale features. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 295 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While praised for its practicality and smooth ride, some common criticisms include its somewhat outdated infotainment system and the CVT's performance compared to traditional automatic transmissions. Owners appreciate the quiet cabin and luxurious appointments, but some dislike the lack of sportiness and the fuel economy.
