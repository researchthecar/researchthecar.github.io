The 2016 INFINITI QX60 is a popular luxury crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and elegant styling. It came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 265 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate its smooth ride and family-friendly features, while others find the CVT transmission and some of the electronic features to be less than ideal. Common dislikes often include concerns about the CVT's reliability and performance, as well as some reported issues with the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks often develop around the valve cover gaskets and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the vehicle, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets or rear main seal as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the location of the leak.

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, check engine light illumination (often with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency), and a rattling noise from the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Juddering/Shaking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint with the QX60's CVT is a juddering or shaking sensation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Some owners describe a feeling of hesitation or slipping. This is often due to degradation of the transmission fluid or issues with the CVT chain/belt.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change *might* resolve the issue if caught early. More severe cases may require a CVT rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change $200 - $400, Rebuild/Replacement $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure. Loss of forward or reverse movement, loud whining noises, or inability to shift gears.
    *   Solution: Complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, leading to a dead battery, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can be attributed to a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    * Solution: Identifying and eliminating the source of the parasitic draw can be very difficult, and involve testing each fuse/relay. In some cases, a software update or replacement of a faulty module may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
