Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2018 INFINITI QX60, categorized by major components, engine/transmission options, and including symptoms, solutions, and estimated costs.

The 2018 INFINITI QX60 is a popular luxury crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 295 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate the QX60's smooth ride and quiet cabin, as well as its ability to comfortably accommodate up to seven passengers. Some common dislikes include the CVT transmission's occasional drone and the relatively uninspired driving experience compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.5L VQ35DE V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. May be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust, indicating oil burning.
    *   Solution: For minor cases, switching to a higher viscosity oil or using an oil additive designed to reduce consumption may help. In more severe cases, engine repair or replacement of piston rings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, particularly when cold. Can progress to poor engine performance, misfires, and eventual engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. It is recommended to replace related components, like the water pump, while the engine is disassembled.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,800 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Jerking/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or shuddering acceleration, hesitation, slipping, and/or transmission failure. Often occurs at lower speeds or during acceleration. Can trigger warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid flush and software update can resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require transmission replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$500 (fluid flush and software update); $3,500-$8,000+ (replacement/rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or buzzing sound emanating from the transmission, especially during acceleration. This can be a sign of internal wear within the CVT.
    *   Solution: Fluid change might help in some minor cases, but this is a sign of internal wear and typically leads to a full replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,500 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn suspension components such as shocks/struts, bushings, sway bar links, or control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent dead batteries, requiring jump starts or replacement. May be caused by parasitic drain from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic drain, followed by repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component causing the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: System freezes, glitches, slow response times, screen flickering, and/or failure to load maps.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. More severe problems may require replacement of the head unit or navigation module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 (software update); $500-$2000+ (replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate fails to open or close properly, becomes stuck, or emits unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of faulty liftgate struts, motor, latch, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Electric seat motor stops working.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the seat motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 INFINITI QX60 has some notable issues, primarily revolving around the CVT transmission and engine oil consumption. The CVT issues can range from minor annoyances to complete transmission failure, resulting in significant repair costs. The oil consumption issue can also lead to engine damage if not addressed promptly. Electrical issues, while less frequent, can also be frustrating and costly to diagnose and repair. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, considering a thorough inspection and potentially budgeting for future repairs.
