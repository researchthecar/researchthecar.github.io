Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2023 INFINITI QX60, formatted for your website. The 2023 INFINITI QX60 is a three-row luxury SUV powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 295 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. This engine is exclusively paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the QX60's stylish design, comfortable interior, and ample passenger space. Some common criticisms include a less-than-sporty driving experience and a sometimes unresponsive infotainment system.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the timing chain can lead to engine noise (rattling, especially on startup), rough idling, and potential engine damage if not addressed. This is often due to inadequate lubrication or defective chain tensioners.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially other related components. Some dealerships may recommend flushing the engine to clear any debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or front/rear crankshaft seals. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the affected gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the location and complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting, especially during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. This can also manifest as hesitation when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush or replacement is necessary. More severe cases could require valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $3,000+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping can occur when the transmission fails to properly engage a gear, resulting in a momentary loss of power or a delayed response when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Initially, inspect the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush might help. If the problem persists, further diagnostics are necessary to determine the cause, which could be worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear of suspension components such as struts, shocks, and control arm bushings leading to uneven tire wear, clunking noises, and reduced ride comfort.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ per corner (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, slow response times, and connectivity problems with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealership are the first step. If the problems persist, the infotainment unit might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions with sensors related to driver-assistance systems (e.g., blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control) can lead to false alerts or system inoperability.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to identify the faulty sensor and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tailgate failing to open or close properly, making a grinding noise, or stopping midway.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic check to determine if the issue is with the motor, struts, or sensors. Replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the heating and air conditioning system, such as inconsistent temperature control, failure to blow hot or cold air, or unusual noises from the vents.
