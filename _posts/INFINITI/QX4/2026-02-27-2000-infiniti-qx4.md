### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Infiniti QX4 is a capable luxury SUV with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The 3.3L V6 engine is robust but can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and requires timely timing belt replacements to avoid catastrophic failure. The automatic transmission is generally reliable but can develop slipping issues over time. Common wear items include suspension components like ball joints and tie rods, as well as struts. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can arise. Exterior paint can show age with clear coat peeling, and interior wear on leather is typical. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing known issues, the QX4 can remain a dependable vehicle.
