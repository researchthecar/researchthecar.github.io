### Summary Verdict
The 2003 INFINITI QX4 is generally a reliable luxury SUV, especially concerning its powertrain. The 3.5L V6 engine and the automatic transmission have proven durable, though minor oil leaks from the timing chain cover gasket and occasional VVT solenoid issues are documented. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear over time, leading to steering and noise issues. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster problems and power window failures, are not uncommon for vehicles of this age. Interior issues are typically minor, with HVAC blower resistor failures and sunroof drain clogs being the most frequently cited. Overall, with proper maintenance and attention to these potential weak points, the QX4 can remain a dependable vehicle.
