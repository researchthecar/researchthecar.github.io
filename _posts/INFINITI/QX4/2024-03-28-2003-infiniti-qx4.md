**Introduction to the 2003 INFINITI QX4**

The 2003 INFINITI QX4 is a mid-size luxury SUV that combines rugged off-road capabilities with a comfortable and upscale interior. It is powered by a powerful 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 240 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. The QX4 is available with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission. The vehicle offers a spacious cabin, a well-equipped interior, and a smooth ride. However, it is known to have some issues that can affect its performance and reliability.

**Engine**

* **3.5L V6 Engine**
    * **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt can fail prematurely, leading to catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a loss of power, a rough idle, and engine knocking. The solution is to replace the timing belt, tensioner, and water pump, which costs around $1,000 - $2,000.
    * **Oil Leaks:** The QX4 may develop oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets or the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle and a burning oil smell. The solution is to replace the leaking gaskets, which costs around $500 - $1,000.

**Transmission**

* **4-Speed Automatic Transmission**
    * **Transmission Slipping:** The transmission may slip gears or hesitate to shift, especially when climbing hills or accelerating. Symptoms include a loss of power, a rough shift, and delayed engagement. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission, which costs around $2,500 - $4,000.
    * **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter may fail, causing the transmission to slip or overheat. Symptoms include a loss of power, a shudder when shifting, and a burnt transmission fluid smell. The solution is to replace the torque converter, which costs around $1,500 - $2,500.
* **5-Speed Manual Transmission**
    * **Clutch Failure:** The clutch may wear out prematurely, causing difficulty shifting gears or a loss of power. Symptoms include a slipping clutch, a burning smell, and a hard shift. The solution is to replace the clutch, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing, which costs around $800 - $1,200.

**Suspension**

* **Strut Failure:** The struts may fail prematurely, leading to a loss of stability and handling. Symptoms include a rough ride, a knocking sound, and uneven tire wear. The solution is to replace the struts, which costs around $600 - $1,000 per axle.
* **Ball Joint Failure:** The ball joints may wear out, causing the suspension to become loose. Symptoms include a clunking sound, a loose feeling in the steering, and uneven tire wear. The solution is to replace the ball joints, which costs around $300 - $500 per axle.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery may drain prematurely, even when the vehicle is not in use. Symptoms include a dead battery and a lack of power. The solution is to diagnose and repair any electrical faults that are causing the battery to drain, which can cost anywhere from $100 - $500+ depending on the issue.
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may fail, preventing the battery from charging. Symptoms include a loss of power, a dim or flickering dashboard, and a warning light. The solution is to replace the alternator, which costs around $500 - $1,000.
* **Starter Failure:** The starter may fail, preventing the engine from starting. Symptoms include a clicking sound when starting the vehicle and a lack of power. The solution is to replace the starter, which costs around $300 - $500.

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** The QX4 may develop rust on the undercarriage, frame, and body panels. Symptoms include bubbled or flaking paint, holes, and a weakening of the metal. The solution is to repair or replace the rusted parts, which can cost anywhere from $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity of the rust.

**Interior**

* **AC/Heater Blower Motor Failure:** The AC/heater blower motor may fail, causing a lack of air flow from the vents. Symptoms include a lack of cool or hot air and a noisy blower motor. The solution is to replace the blower motor, which costs around $200 - $400.
* **Power Window Failure:** The power window motors or switches may fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. Symptoms include windows that do not roll up or down and a lack of response from the window switches. The solution is to replace the failed motor or switch, which costs around $200 - $500 per window.

**Summary**

The 2003 INFINITI QX4 is a capable and comfortable SUV, but it is not without its issues. While most of the problems are relatively minor and can be repaired for a reasonable cost, some, such as timing belt failure and transmission problems, can be more severe and expensive to fix.
