### Summary Verdict
The 2010 INFINITI FX50, while offering a compelling blend of performance and luxury, presents some common reliability concerns. The 5.0L V8 engine can experience oil and coolant leaks, typical for higher-mileage performance vehicles. The 7-speed automatic transmission may develop shifting issues or leaks. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and Body Control Module, can arise.
