Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2011 INFINITI FX50, organized by category, engine/transmission option, and including estimated repair costs where available.

The 2011 INFINITI FX50 is a performance-oriented luxury crossover SUV. It comes standard with a 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 390 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Some popular aspects of the vehicle are its powerful engine, stylish design, and sporty handling. On the other hand, some criticisms often revolve around its fuel economy, firm ride, and relatively small cargo space compared to other SUVs.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8**
* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption is reported in some instances. Drivers may notice needing to add oil more frequently than expected, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage if not monitored. Blue smoke from the exhaust can also be a symptom.
    * Solution: Diagnosis is required to determine the root cause, which could range from worn piston rings to valve stem seals. Repair options can include replacing these components or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause and extent of repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the timing chain wearing prematurely or stretching. Symptoms include a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold, and potential misfire codes.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or harsh shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can manifest as clunking noises or a noticeable jerk during gear changes.
    * Solution: Begin with a transmission fluid change using the correct INFINITI/Nissan fluid. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may reveal issues with the valve body, solenoids, or internal components requiring repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500 (fluid change, solenoid replacement) to $2,000+ (valve body replacement or transmission rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature failure of the front struts, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and clunking noises when going over bumps.
    * Solution: Replacement of the front struts. Consider replacing both struts at the same time to maintain even handling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000 (for parts and labor, replacing both struts)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Navigation/Infotainment System Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, and complete failure of the navigation/infotainment system. The system can become unresponsive or display error messages.
    * Solution: Software updates may resolve minor glitches. For more severe issues, replacement of the head unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200 (Software Update) to $500 - $2,000+ (Head Unit Replacement)

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the battery draining prematurely, particularly if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods. This can result in difficulty starting the car.
