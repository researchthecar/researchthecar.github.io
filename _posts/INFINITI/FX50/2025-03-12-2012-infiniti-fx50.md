The 2012 INFINITI FX50 is a luxury crossover SUV known for its sporty handling and powerful engine. This model year offered two engine options: a 3.5L V6 and a potent 5.0L V8. The 5.0L V8 engine produced approximately 390 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, delivering brisk acceleration and a thrilling driving experience. The FX50 appealed to drivers seeking a blend of performance and luxury. However, some common criticisms included the firm ride, limited cargo space, and somewhat dated infotainment system. Issues with reliability and electronic components also appear in owner feedback. Both engine options are mated to a 7-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8 (VK50VE)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil light illumination, smoky exhaust, and potential engine damage if not addressed. This issue seems more prevalent in higher mileage vehicles.
    * Solution: Diagnosis involves checking for leaks and performing an oil consumption test. If no leaks are found, potential solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or, in severe cases, replacing the engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $6,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A rattling or knocking noise from the engine, especially upon startup, can indicate a failing timing chain tensioner. If left unaddressed, this can lead to timing chain failure, causing significant engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner and potentially the timing chain itself.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 (VQ35HR)**

* **Oil Leaks (Valve Covers and Gallery Gaskets)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a relatively common issue with the VQ35HR engine. The valve cover gaskets and gallery gaskets are prone to leaking over time, leading to oil spots under the vehicle and a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets and/or gallery gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gaskets $200 - $500. Gallery gaskets $1,000 - $2,000+ due to the complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission (RE7R01A)**

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift. These issues can stem from wear and tear or internal component failure within the valve body.
    * Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and replacement can temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but it is unlikely to be a permanent fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the severity of the damage and whether the valve body can be rebuilt or needs to be replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps. The vehicle may also exhibit poor handling and uneven tire wear. Visual inspection often reveals cracks or tears in the control arm bushings.
    * Solution: Replacing the front lower control arms. While bushings can be pressed in, replacing the entire arm is often more cost-effective.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per side, including parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride quality, excessive bouncing, and visible fluid leaks on the shock absorbers.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ for both rear shocks, including parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent dead batteries, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for a short period. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty electrical component.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component. This can involve testing various circuits and components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Navigation/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or complete failure of the navigation or infotainment system. This can be due to software glitches, hardware failures, or issues with the display screen.
    * Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, replacing the navigation unit or screen may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the repair required.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may not open or close properly, gets stuck, or makes excessive noise. Water leaks are also a possibility.
    * Solution: Repairing or replacing the sunroof motor, tracks, or seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Power Seat Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power seats may fail to adjust or move properly due to a faulty motor.
    * Solution: Replacing the seat motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per seat motor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 INFINITI FX50 can be a fun and luxurious vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption and timing chain issues on the V8, can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical issues are also relatively common. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can quickly escalate into significant expenses. Careful inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
