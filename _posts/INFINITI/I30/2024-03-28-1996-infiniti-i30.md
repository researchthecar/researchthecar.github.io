**Introduction:**

The 1996 INFINITI I30 is a mid-size luxury sedan powered by a 3.0-liter V6 engine paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. It offers a comfortable and refined ride, along with plenty of power for daily driving. However, like any vehicle, it has some known issues.

**Engine:**

**3.0-Liter V6**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** This issue affects the rubber intake manifold gaskets, which can deteriorate over time, causing vacuum leaks. Symptoms include rough idling, loss of power, and increased emissions. The solution involves replacing the intake manifold gaskets. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
* **Exhaust manifold cracking:** The exhaust manifolds on the 3.0-liter V6 can develop cracks, which can lead to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a loud exhaust noise and a loss of power. The solution involves replacing the exhaust manifolds. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Transmission:**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift solenoid failure:** The shift solenoids in the transmission can fail, causing delayed or erratic shifting. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, slipping gears, and a shuddering sensation while shifting. The solution involves replacing the faulty solenoids. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter in the transmission can develop a shudder, which is felt as a vibration during acceleration. The solution involves replacing the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

**Suspension:**

* **Strut mount bearing failure:** The strut mount bearings can fail, causing a rattling or clunking noise when driving over bumps. The solution involves replacing the strut mounts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per corner
* **Sway bar end link failure:** The sway bar end links can fail, causing a knocking or clunking noise when driving over bumps. The solution involves replacing the end links. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 per side

**Electrical:**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to not be properly charged. Symptoms include dim headlights, flickering interior lights, and a dead battery. The solution involves replacing the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
* **Starter failure:** The starter motor can fail, preventing the engine from starting. Symptoms include a clicking noise when turning the key or no response at all. The solution involves replacing the starter motor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+

**Exterior:**

* **Door handle failure:** The door handles can become loose or break, making it difficult to open the doors. The solution involves replacing the door handles. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 per door
* **Weatherstripping failure:** The weatherstripping around the windows and doors can deteriorate over time, causing wind noise and water leaks. The solution involves replacing the weatherstripping. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for all doors and windows

**Interior:**

* **Climate control knobs breaking:** The knobs for the climate control system can break, making it difficult to adjust the temperature or fan speed. The solution involves replacing the knobs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 per knob

**Summary:**

The 1996 INFINITI I30 is a reliable and comfortable vehicle, but it does have some known issues, particularly with the engine, transmission, and suspension. The severity of these issues varies, and the cost to fix them can range from minor to expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider the cost of repairs before purchasing a used I30.
