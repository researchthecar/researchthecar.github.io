**Introduction:**

The 1997 INFINITI I30 is a luxury sedan that offers a refined and comfortable driving experience. It is powered by a 3.0-liter V6 engine that produces 190 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The I30 is known for its smooth ride, well-equipped interior, and responsive handling. However, like any car, it has its share of potential issues.

**Engine/3.0-liter V6**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A faulty intake manifold gasket can cause coolant and oil leaks, leading to engine overheating and smoke. **Replace the intake manifold gasket.** **$500 - $800+**
* **Timing Belt Tensioner Failure:** The timing belt tensioner can fail, causing the timing belt to skip or break. This can result in severe engine damage. **Replace the timing belt tensioner.** **$1,000 - $1,500+**
* **Oil Pump Failure:** In some cases, the oil pump may fail, resulting in a loss of oil pressure and potential engine seizure. **Replace the oil pump.** **$500 - $800+**

**Transmission/4-speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slipping:** The transmission may experience slipping or shuddering during gear changes. **Overhaul or replace the transmission.** **$2,000 - $3,000+**
* **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing a loss of power and transmission problems. **Replace the torque converter.** **$1,200 - $1,800+**
* **Shift Solenoid Issues:** Faulty shift solenoids can prevent the transmission from shifting gears smoothly. **Replace the shift solenoids.** **$200 - $400+**
