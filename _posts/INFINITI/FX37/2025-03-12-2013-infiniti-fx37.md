The 2013 INFINITI FX37 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV known for its sporty handling and distinctive styling. It came standard with a 3.7-liter V6 engine (VQ37VHR) producing 325 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. The FX37's engine and transmission options were the same across all trims. Owners generally appreciate the vehicle's performance, comfortable interior, and unique design. Common dislikes include the firm ride, limited cargo space, and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6 (VQ37VHR)**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially in colder weather. This is caused by a faulty timing chain tensioner that allows the chain to slack, leading to the noise. Over time, if the tensioner continues to fail, it can cause significant engine damage and potential timing chain failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, guides, and chain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil between oil changes and blue exhaust smoke, potentially indicating worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: The problem can range from needing to replace PCV valve to a full engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (RE7R01A)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, especially between certain gears. Slipping can occur. The issue is caused by worn or malfunctioning valves within the transmission valve body, which controls hydraulic pressure to the various clutches and brakes in the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve body. Sometimes, a complete transmission rebuild is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bumpy ride, excessive bouncing, clunking noises over bumps, poor handling. Struts/shocks lose their damping ability over time, leading to these symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected struts or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle has difficulty starting or a dead battery, particularly after sitting for a period of time. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory that is not shutting down properly.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair the source of the parasitic draw. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories (e.g., alarms, remote starters), the navigation system, or the Bluetooth module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may flicker, go blank, or become unresponsive. This can be due to a failure of the LCD screen, the video processing module, or the wiring harness connecting these components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the navigation screen, video processing module, or repair of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic tailgate may fail to open or close properly, or may make unusual noises during operation. This can be due to a failing motor, struts, or sensors in the tailgate mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the tailgate motor, struts, or sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Heated/Cooled Seat Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heated or cooled seats may not function properly or may provide inconsistent heating or cooling. This can be due to a faulty heating element, blower motor, or control module.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the heating element, blower motor, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 INFINITI FX37 has some notable issues, particularly relating to the engine (timing chain tensioners, oil consumption) and transmission (valve body). These issues can be costly to repair. Electrical problems like battery drain and navigation screen failures are also commonly reported. Suspension and other issues also tend to happen in this model year. While the FX37 offers a sporty driving experience and a luxurious interior, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and budget accordingly for potential repairs or conduct a thorough inspection before purchasing.
