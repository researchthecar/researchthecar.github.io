The 2023 INFINITI QX55 is a coupe-inspired SUV, aiming for a blend of style and practicality. It offers a single engine option: a 2.0-liter VC-Turbo inline-4 engine producing 268 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise its distinctive design and comfortable interior, but some criticisms include the CVT's performance and the limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline.
