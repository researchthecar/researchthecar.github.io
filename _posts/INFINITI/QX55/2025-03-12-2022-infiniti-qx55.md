The 2022 INFINITI QX55 is a stylish and sporty crossover coupe based on the QX50 platform. It features a sloping roofline and a focus on design. All QX55 models come equipped with a 2.0-liter VC-Turbo inline-4 engine producing 268 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the QX55's attractive styling and comfortable interior but sometimes find the CVT transmission uninspiring compared to traditional automatics and note the reduced rear headroom due to the coupe-like roofline.

**Summary**

The 2022 INFINITI QX55 presents some potential issues, with the most concerning being engine-related (turbocharger failure, oil consumption) and transmission issues with the CVT. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system, are also worth noting. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive (software updates, minor repairs), others can be quite costly (turbocharger replacement, CVT replacement, engine repair). While the styling is often praised, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase.
