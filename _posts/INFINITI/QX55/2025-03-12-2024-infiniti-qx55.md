The 2024 INFINITI QX55 is a stylish coupe-inspired crossover SUV aimed at those prioritizing aesthetics and a sporty driving experience. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter VC-Turbo inline-4 engine producing 268 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). The QX55 is generally praised for its eye-catching design and comfortable interior, while some criticisms focus on the CVT's performance and limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline. Fuel economy can also be a point of concern for some owners.

**Engine**

**2.0L VC-Turbo Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.0L VC-Turbo engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can be indicated by the low oil level warning light illuminating on the dashboard, or visually confirmed by checking the dipstick.
    *   Solution: The solution typically involves performing an oil consumption test at the dealership to determine the extent of the problem. Depending on the results, potential fixes range from replacing the PCV valve, performing an engine decarbonization treatment, or in more severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature turbocharger failure can occur, leading to a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine bay (whining or whistling), and potential error codes related to turbocharger boost pressure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation upon acceleration, especially from a stop or at low speeds. Additionally, some experience jerking or shuddering during acceleration or when maintaining a constant speed.
    *   Solution: Initially, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) might be attempted. If the problem persists, a CVT fluid flush or replacement of the CVT unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or high-pitched noise emanating from the transmission area, especially during acceleration, can be a sign of CVT issues. This can worsen over time.
    *   Solution: The source of the noise will need to be diagnosed. This is often a sign that the CVT is starting to wear internally, and replacement is often the best choice to ensure there are no further issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes intermittently. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. If not, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after short periods of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the parasitic drain source. Could be a faulty module (e.g., infotainment, BCM), or improperly shut-off system. Replacement of the battery and faulty components, if applicable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with external sensors, such as parking sensors and blind spot monitors. Can be caused by water damage, debris, or just natural wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may have issues opening or closing properly, or may fail to seal completely, leading to wind noise or water leaks.
    *   Solution: Inspection and cleaning of the sunroof tracks. Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 INFINITI QX55, while generally well-regarded for its styling, does exhibit some common issues. The most concerning are related to the engine (excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failure) and the CVT transmission (hesitation, jerking, and noise). Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also present. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements or software updates to several thousand for engine or transmission replacements. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite costly, making it essential to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
