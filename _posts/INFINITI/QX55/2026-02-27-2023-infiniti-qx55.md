# 2023 INFINITI QX55

### Overview
The 2023 INFINITI QX55 presents a generally strong reliability profile, blending luxury with a sporty coupe-like SUV design. It shares much of its underlying architecture with the QX50, which has a history of decent, though not class-leading, reliability. The QX55's powertrain, a 2.0-liter variable compression turbocharged engine paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), is the primary focus for potential concerns. While generally performing well, some owners have reported specific issues related to the engine's complex technology and the CVT's long-term durability. Other areas like suspension, electrical systems, and interior components have shown fewer widespread problems, indicating good overall build quality in these aspects. Exterior elements have also been largely free of significant defects.

### Summary Verdict
The 2023 INFINITI QX55 demonstrates a mixed reliability picture. While its exterior, interior, and suspension components generally hold up well with no widespread issues, the powertrain is where most reported concerns lie. The 2.0L VC-Turbo engine can experience oil consumption and turbocharger problems, and the CVT transmission may exhibit hesitation or jerking. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional premature 12V battery failure, are also noted. Owners should be diligent with maintenance, especially regarding oil levels, and be aware of potential powertrain and electrical system quirks. Overall, it's a reasonably reliable luxury crossover, but potential buyers should weigh these specific concerns against its stylish design and features.
