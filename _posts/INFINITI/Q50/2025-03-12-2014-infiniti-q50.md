Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2014 INFINITI Q50, organized as requested. The 2014 INFINITI Q50 marked the beginning of a new generation for the brand's sport sedan. It offered a blend of style, technology, and performance. It was available with a few different engine options. The Q50 was generally praised for its sleek design, comfortable ride, and advanced technology features, such as the InTouch infotainment system. However, some owners found the electronic power steering system to be numb and lacking feedback, and the InTouch system was often criticized for its complexity and occasional unresponsiveness.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6 (VQ37VHR)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or visible smoke from the exhaust in severe cases.
    *   Solution: The fix varies. Some have success with switching to a different oil viscosity. Others may require more extensive repairs, such as replacing valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the source and severity of the oil consumption)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  A rattling noise, especially on startup, could indicate a failing timing chain tensioner. This can lead to timing chain wear or failure if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged I4**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (RE7R01A)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds.  May also notice delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps.  Worn bushings can also affect handling and stability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings (control arm bushings are a common culprit).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on which bushings need replacement and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Direct Adaptive Steering (DAS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Some models equipped with DAS experience issues such as jerky steering, loss of steering assist, or warning lights related to the system. This system was optional.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis can be complex and may involve software updates, sensor replacement, or replacement of the DAS control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the specific issue and parts needed)
    *   Recalls: 2014 Q50 with Direct Adaptive Steering (DAS) Recall ID: 13V573000

**Electrical**

*   **InTouch Infotainment System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, slow response, Bluetooth connectivity issues, navigation errors, and general unreliability.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available) can sometimes improve performance.  In some cases, replacement of the head unit is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits for a few days.  Can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution:  Diagnosis of the source of the parasitic draw and repair/replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Multiple sensors may fail intermittently. These include O2, ABS, and Wheel Speed sensors.

**Summary**

The 2014 INFINITI Q50 has a mix of potential issues. Engine issues, such as oil consumption and timing chain tensioner problems, can be costly to fix. Transmission issues, particularly with the valve body and torque converter, are also common. Electrical problems, especially with the InTouch infotainment system, are a frequent source of frustration. Suspension issues, like premature bushing wear and Direct Adaptive Steering problems, add to the potential maintenance costs. While not all Q50s will experience these issues, prospective buyers should be aware of them and have a pre-purchase inspection performed to assess the car's condition. Overall, these issues range from moderate to severe in terms of repair cost and potential impact on vehicle reliability.
