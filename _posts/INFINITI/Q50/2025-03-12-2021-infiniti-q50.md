The 2021 INFINITI Q50 is a luxury sport sedan that offers a blend of performance and comfort. The most common engine option is the 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6, producing 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque in the base models, or 400 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque in the Red Sport 400 trim. A less common 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine is available, producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Q50 for its powerful engine options, sporty handling, and luxurious interior. Common complaints include the infotainment system's outdated interface, the lack of driver feedback in the steering (especially in non-Red Sport models), and the somewhat firm ride quality.

    * Solution: Replacing the belt tensioner.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the severity and part failures
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (RE7R01A)**

**Summary**

The 2021 INFINITI Q50 has a range of potential issues, with the most concerning being the turbocharger failures in the 3.0L V6 engine and harsh shifting in the 7-speed automatic transmission. The costs associated with these repairs can be significant. While the infotainment issues and sensor malfunctions can be frustrating, they are generally less expensive to fix. Premature bushing wear can lead to handling problems and increased wear and tear on other suspension components if left unchecked. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
