The 2016 INFINITI Q50 is a popular luxury sports sedan known for its sleek styling, comfortable ride, and engaging driving experience. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder, a 3.0L twin-turbo V6 (introduced mid-year as a replacement for the existing 3.7L V6), and a 3.5L V6 paired with an electric motor in the hybrid model. The 2.0L turbo four-cylinder produces 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 3.7L V6 (initially offered) put out 328 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. The 3.0L twin-turbo V6 produces either 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque or 400 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque depending on the trim level. A 7-speed automatic transmission is standard across the range. Some owners appreciate the Q50's sporty handling and luxurious interior. However, common complaints revolve around the electronic power steering system (especially the Direct Adaptive Steering), the infotainment system, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2016 INFINITI Q50 can be a rewarding vehicle to own, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the turbocharger and the 3.0L V6 belt tensioner and water pumps, can be costly. Transmission issues related to the valve body are also a concern. Electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and Direct Adaptive Steering can be frustrating. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive (bushing replacements), others (turbocharger, valve body, DAS components) can be quite costly, making a pre-purchase inspection essential.
