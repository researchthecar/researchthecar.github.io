The 2020 INFINITI Q50 is a luxury sport sedan known for its stylish design and powerful engine options. The Q50 is available with a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 engine that produces either 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque in its base form, or 400 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque in the Red Sport 400 trim. A 2.0L Turbo Inline-4 is also available producing 208 Horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. All engine options are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Q50 for its strong acceleration and comfortable ride, but some criticisms include the sometimes-numb steering feel and the infotainment system's usability.

**Summary**

The 2020 INFINITI Q50 has several common issues. The most concerning issues are related to the engine (turbocharger failure) and transmission (rough shifting/slipping), which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, such as infotainment system malfunctions and sensor failures, are also prevalent and can be disruptive. Suspension bushing wear is another common issue, leading to unwanted noises. While some issues can be resolved with software updates or relatively inexpensive repairs, others may require more significant and costly replacements or repairs, such as turbochargers, transmissions, or infotainment units.
