The 2015 INFINITI Q50 is a popular luxury sport sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience. Available with several engine options, including a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (208 hp, 258 lb-ft of torque), a 3.7L naturally aspirated V6 (328 hp, 269 lb-ft of torque), and a hybrid powertrain pairing a 3.5L V6 with an electric motor (360 total system hp), the Q50 caters to a range of performance preferences. The Q50 is praised for its responsive handling, luxurious features, and attractive styling. Some common criticisms include the sometimes-numb steering feel, particularly in non-sport models, and the complexity of the infotainment system. All engine options are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission.
