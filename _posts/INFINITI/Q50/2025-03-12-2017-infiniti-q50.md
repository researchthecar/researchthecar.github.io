The 2017 INFINITI Q50 is a popular luxury sedan known for its sleek styling, engaging driving dynamics, and comfortable interior. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (208 hp, 258 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L twin-turbo V6 (300 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), and a high-output version of the 3.0L twin-turbo V6 (400 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Q50's sporty handling, comfortable seats, and user-friendly technology, but some common complaints include issues with the electronic power steering, infotainment system glitches, and premature brake wear.
