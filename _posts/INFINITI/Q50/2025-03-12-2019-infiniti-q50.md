The 2019 INFINITI Q50 is a popular luxury sedan known for its sleek styling and engaging driving dynamics. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L twin-turbo V6 producing 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and a high-output version of the same 3.0L twin-turbo V6 producing 400 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Q50's sporty handling and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include the sometimes-criticized infotainment system and the lack of distinct styling compared to previous generations.
