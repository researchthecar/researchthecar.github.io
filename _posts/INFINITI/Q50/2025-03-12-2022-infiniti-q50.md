The 2022 INFINITI Q50 is a luxury sport sedan known for its stylish design and engaging driving experience. It offers a choice of two engines: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 available in two outputs: 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, or 400 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque (Red Sport 400). All engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Q50's comfortable interior, sporty handling, and advanced technology features. Some common criticisms include the dated infotainment system and the lack of steering feel compared to rivals.

**Summary**

The 2022 INFINITI Q50 presents a mix of potential issues. The most serious and costly issues appear to revolve around the turbochargers in the V6 engines and the Direct Adaptive Steering (DAS) system if equipped, with repairs potentially reaching several thousand dollars. Transmission issues are also a concern, and the outdated infotainment system can be frustrating for some owners. While less severe, suspension bushing wear and sunroof malfunctions can also add to the ownership costs. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase, especially if it has high mileage or a history of performance modifications.
