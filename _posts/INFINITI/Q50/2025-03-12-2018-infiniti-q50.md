**Summary**

The 2018 INFINITI Q50 can be a rewarding vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues. Engine problems, particularly turbocharger failure in the 2.0L and water pump failure in the V6, can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues, while sometimes solvable with a software update, can escalate into costly valve body or complete transmission replacements. Electrical problems with the infotainment system are a frequent complaint, and while often fixed with software, the cost can rise significantly if the unit needs replacement. Suspension issues and sunroof problems also contribute to the potential maintenance costs. Overall, while the Q50 offers style and performance, these potential issues should be carefully considered.
