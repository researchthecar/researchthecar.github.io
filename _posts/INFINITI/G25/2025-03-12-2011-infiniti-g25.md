The 2011 INFINITI G25 is a luxury sedan known for its sporty handling and refined interior. It was offered as a more fuel-efficient alternative to the G37, sharing many of the same features but with a smaller engine. The G25 is powered by a 2.5-liter V6 engine producing 218 horsepower and 187 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the G25's comfortable ride, attractive styling, and responsive steering. Common complaints include somewhat limited rear legroom and a less powerful engine compared to the G37.

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve covers, front timing cover, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. For more severe leaks, the entire valve cover or other components may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip between gears, hesitate to shift, or shift harshly. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds or during acceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may alleviate the issue. However, more severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.

    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings. In some cases, it may be more cost-effective to replace the entire control arm or sway bar link assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ per corner depending on the parts replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain overnight or over a few days, resulting in a no-start condition. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing individual circuits and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation or infotainment system may experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure. This can be due to software issues or hardware failures.
