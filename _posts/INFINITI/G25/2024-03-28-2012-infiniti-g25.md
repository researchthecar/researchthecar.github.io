**Introduction:**

The 2012 INFINITI G25 is a豪华compact sports sedan known for its sleek design, refined interior, and responsive performance. It is offered with a single engine and transmission option: a 2.5L V6 engine paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. The G25 delivers 218 horsepower and 187 lb-ft of torque, providing ample power for everyday driving and spirited handling. Critics praise the vehicle's comfortable ride, sharp steering, and spacious cabin but note its firm suspension and limited rear seat legroom.

**Suspension**

* **Premature wear of front lower control arm bushings:** These bushings can deteriorate prematurely, causing knocking or squeaking sounds when driving over bumps. Replacing the bushings costs around $500 - $700 per side.
* **Shock absorber failure:** Some G25s have experienced premature failure of the rear shock absorbers. Symptoms include poor ride quality, excessive body roll, and difficulty controlling the vehicle over rough roads. Replacing the shock absorbers typically costs around $800 - $1,200 for all four.

**Electrical**

* **Faulty ignition coils:** Defective ignition coils can cause misfires, rough idling, and reduced engine power. Replacing the ignition coils costs around $200 - $300 per coil.
* **Battery drain:** Some vehicles may experience a parasitic battery drain that can lead to a dead battery. The issue can be traced to various electrical components, such as the infotainment system or interior lights. Diagnosing and repairing the problem can vary in cost depending on the source of the drain.
* **Recall: NHTSA Campaign ID 15V328000:** This recall addresses a potential issue with the airbag control unit, which may become damaged by static electricity. The remedy involves replacing the airbag control unit.

* **Navigation system glitches:** Some vehicles have experienced intermittent issues with the navigation system, such as freezing or displaying incorrect directions. Updating the software or replacing the navigation unit may resolve the problem. The cost to update the software is around $100 - $200, while replacing the navigation unit can cost up to $1,500.
* **Center console lid rattle:** The center console lid may rattle or make noise while driving. Tightening or replacing the lid's attachment points can fix the issue. The cost of this repair is usually around $100 - $200.

**Summary:**

The 2012 INFINITI G25 is generally a reliable vehicle, but certain issues can potentially affect it. While some issues, such as oil leaks and premature suspension wear, may require immediate attention and significant repairs, many other issues are relatively minor and less expensive to fix. Overall, the severity and cost of potential issues should be carefully considered when purchasing a pre-owned G25.
