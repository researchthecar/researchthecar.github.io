The 2018 INFINITI QX80 is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine, and comfortable ride. The QX80 is only available with one engine option: a 5.6-liter V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and towing capability. However, some criticisms include its dated styling, large turning radius, and fuel economy.

**Summary**

The 2018 INFINITI QX80 has some notable issues, primarily related to the engine (timing chain guides, oil consumption) and transmission (rough shifting, slipping). The air suspension system, if equipped, can also be prone to failures. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and backup camera, as well as automatic liftgate problems, are also reported. The severity of these issues varies, and the cost to repair can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission repairs. While these issues can be significant, many owners find the QX80's luxury features and performance outweigh the potential maintenance costs.
