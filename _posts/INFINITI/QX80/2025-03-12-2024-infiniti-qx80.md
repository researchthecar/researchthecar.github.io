The 2024 INFINITI QX80 is a full-size luxury SUV powered by a 5.6-liter V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and robust towing capacity, the QX80 appeals to buyers seeking a traditional luxury SUV experience. However, some common complaints include its outdated infotainment system, lower fuel economy compared to competitors, and bulky size, which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces. The vehicle is not offered with any other engine or transmission options.

**Engine**

**5.6L V8**

*   **Timing Chain Rattle/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, especially noticeable upon cold start, can indicate issues with the timing chain. In severe cases, this can lead to engine misfires, poor performance, and even engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially the variable valve timing (VVT) actuators.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes indicating catalytic converter inefficiency. Decreased engine performance and fuel economy. A rotten egg smell coming from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifting between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation or delay when shifting from park or neutral into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or transmission fluid flush can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The QX80 offers an optional air suspension system. Failure of the air suspension can result in a ride height malfunction (vehicle sitting too low or unevenly), a bumpy or uncomfortable ride, and an illuminated warning light on the dashboard. Noises coming from the air compressor or air struts are also an indicator.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the affected components (air struts, air compressor, air lines, height sensors). Replacement of faulty parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut, depending on location and if aftermarket.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software update of the infotainment system, if available. Replacement of the infotainment system unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update, if available) - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially if it sits for an extended period. This can result in difficulty starting the engine or complete battery failure.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic drain (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory). Repairing or replacing the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic tailgate may fail to open or close properly. This can be due to a faulty motor, sensor, or hydraulic strut.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the tailgate mechanism. Replacement of the faulty motor, sensor, or strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, typically around the headliner or sunroof/moonroof area, during rain or car washes. Clogged drain tubes are a common cause.
    *   Solution: Clearing the sunroof/moonroof drain tubes. Repairing or replacing damaged seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 INFINITI QX80 appears to have several potential issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical glitches to more significant engine and transmission problems. The most concerning issues relate to the engine (timing chain, catalytic converters) and transmission (rough shifting), which could be costly to repair. Air suspension issues can be expensive to repair if equipped. Electrical issues such as infotainment problems may be more of an annoyance than a serious mechanical concern. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and carefully inspect any prospective vehicle, particularly for signs of engine noise, transmission problems, and electrical malfunctions.
