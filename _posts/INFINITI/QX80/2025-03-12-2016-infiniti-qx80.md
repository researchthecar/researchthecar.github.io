**Engine**

**5.6L VK56VD V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes. Symptoms can include the low oil pressure light illuminating and the engine running rough due to low oil levels.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a simple repair such as replacing the PCV valve is the fix. In other cases, replacement of piston rings or even the entire engine may be required. A compression test can help determine the extent of the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV Valve) - $5000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature failure of the timing chain tensioners, which can lead to engine noise, poor performance, and eventually, engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (RE7R01A)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Slipping can also occur, where the engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or transmission fluid flush can resolve the issue. However, more severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Fluid Flush) - $500 (Software Update) - $1500+ (Valve Body) - $4000+ (Transmission Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system, if equipped, can be prone to leaks, compressor failures, and sensor malfunctions. Symptoms include the vehicle sitting unevenly, a "suspension fault" warning light, and a rough ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts, compressor, or sensors. It is often recommended to replace components in pairs to ensure even performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per corner (strut replacement), $500 - $1500+ (compressor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
