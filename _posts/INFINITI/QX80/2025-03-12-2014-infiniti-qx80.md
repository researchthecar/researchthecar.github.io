The 2014 INFINITI QX80 is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine, and comfortable ride. It came standard with a 5.6-liter V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the QX80's towing capacity, luxurious features, and overall size, but some common complaints include poor fuel economy, a cumbersome size for city driving, and a relatively dated infotainment system compared to newer competitors.

**Engine**

**5.6L V8 (VK56VD)**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine rattling noise, especially upon startup. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to camshaft timing or correlation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially camshaft sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent need to add engine oil between scheduled oil changes. Blue exhaust smoke may be visible.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing valve stem seals or piston rings may be necessary. A PCV valve replacement is sometimes considered.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the source of oil consumption and the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping during acceleration, harsh or delayed shifts between gears, or a "clunking" sound during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid is often the first step. In some instances, the valve body might require replacement or rebuilding. In severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement could be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $1,000+ (valve body) - $3,000 - $6,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Hydraulic Body Motion Control (HBMC) System Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HBMC system helps reduce body roll during cornering. Leaks in the hydraulic lines, accumulators, or actuators can cause the system to malfunction. Symptoms include increased body roll, uneven ride height, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak by replacing the damaged components (lines, accumulators, actuators). Fluid flush and fill.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the part and leak location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, screen flickering, or complete failure of the navigation/infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve minor glitches. In some cases, the head unit itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500 - $1,500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not in use. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the drain by testing the charging system and checking for parasitic drains. Potential causes include faulty alternators, relays stuck in the "on" position, or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may not open or close properly, may stop mid-cycle, or may make unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Check the struts, motor, and sensors associated with the liftgate. Replacement of faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to heat properly, heat intermittently, or not turn on at all.
    *   Solution: Check the heating elements, wiring, and switch for the seat heaters. Replacement of the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may not open or close properly, may make grinding noises, or may leak water.
    *   Solution: Inspect sunroof tracks, motor, and seals. Lubricate or replace damaged parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
