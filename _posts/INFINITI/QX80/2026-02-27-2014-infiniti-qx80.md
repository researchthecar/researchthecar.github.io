### Summary Verdict
The 2014 INFINITI QX80 is a generally reliable large SUV, with its robust 5.6L V8 engine being a strong point. However, potential owners should be aware of a few common issues. Oil consumption and timing chain noise can occur with higher mileage engines, requiring attention. The 7-speed automatic transmission may exhibit harsh shifting. The advanced Hydraulic Body Control System (HBMC) can be prone to fluid leaks or pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and Body Control Module, are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most frequent technical concerns reported for this model year, suggesting that thorough pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance are advisable.
