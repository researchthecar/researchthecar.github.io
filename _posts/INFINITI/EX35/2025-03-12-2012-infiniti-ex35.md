The 2012 INFINITI EX35 is a compact luxury crossover known for its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and stylish design. It came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (VQ35HR) producing 297 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the EX35 for its responsiveness, luxurious features, and relatively nimble handling compared to larger SUVs. However, some common complaints include a somewhat small cargo area, dated infotainment system, and less-than-stellar fuel economy for its class.
