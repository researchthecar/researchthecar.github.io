The 2011 INFINITI EX35 is a compact luxury crossover known for its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and stylish design. It came equipped with only one engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 (VQ35HR) producing 297 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the EX35's engaging driving experience and upscale features. However, some common complaints include a small cargo area, limited rear passenger space, and sometimes higher than expected maintenance costs.
