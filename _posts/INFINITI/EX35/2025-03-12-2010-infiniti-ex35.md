The 2010 INFINITI EX35 is a compact luxury crossover known for its sporty handling, stylish design, and comfortable interior. It was available with a single engine option, the 3.5-liter VQ35HR V6, producing 297 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque. It's known for its performance and smooth operation. A common point of praise for the EX35 is its agile handling and responsive engine, making it fun to drive. However, some owners find the rear passenger space and cargo capacity to be limited compared to other crossovers in its class. The infotainment system, while functional, is considered dated by modern standards.
