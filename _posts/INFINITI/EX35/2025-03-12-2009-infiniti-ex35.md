The 2009 INFINITI EX35 is a compact luxury crossover SUV known for its sporty handling, comfortable ride, and stylish interior.

Owners generally appreciate the EX35's responsive engine, nimble handling, and upscale interior. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space, a small cargo area, and sometimes the dated technology.

**Engine**

**3.5L VQ35HR V6**
* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can occur in some 2009 EX35s with the VQ35HR engine. Symptoms include the need to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a possible low oil light illumination.
    * Solution: The primary solution is to rebuild or replace the engine if the oil consumption is severe. Other solutions can be trying a thicker oil grade.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (engine rebuild or replacement).

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner may fail, leading to a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. In severe cases, this can cause the timing chain to skip, resulting in significant engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner and potentially the timing chain itself.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000.

* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The camshaft position sensor may fail, causing the vehicle to stall, run rough, or have difficulty starting. The check engine light will typically illuminate.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty camshaft position sensor(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The valve body can experience wear and tear over time, leading to hard shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all.
    * Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body. In some cases, flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter can temporarily alleviate the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000.

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can manifest as shuddering during acceleration, unusual noises (whining or rattling) from the transmission, and decreased fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Worn front lower control arm bushings can cause clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. It can also lead to uneven tire wear and steering instability.
    * Solution: Replacing the lower control arms or just the bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear shock absorbers can leak fluid over time, diminishing their damping ability. This can result in a bouncy ride and reduced handling performance.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 INFINITI EX35 has some potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The engine oil consumption and timing chain tensioner are the most severe and costly issues. Transmission valve body issues and suspension wear items are more common and generally less expensive to repair. Electrical problems such as navigation system failures and power window issues can also occur. Overall, the EX35 can be a reliable vehicle if properly maintained, but buyers should carefully inspect the car for these common problems and budget accordingly for potential repairs.
