The 2015 INFINITI Q60 is a stylish and sporty coupe or convertible that offers a blend of performance and luxury. The Q60 was available with two engine options: a 3.7-liter V6 and a 2.0-liter Turbo Inline-4. The 3.7-liter V6 produces 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.0-liter Turbo Inline-4 produces 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 3.7L engine is paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.0L is paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Q60 for its attractive styling, comfortable ride, and powerful V6 engine (where applicable). Common complaints include a dated infotainment system, limited rear-seat space (especially in the coupe), and average fuel economy.
