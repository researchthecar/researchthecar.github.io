The 2019 INFINITI Q60 is a sleek and stylish sports coupe known for its powerful engine options and luxurious features. While the Q60 offers a comfortable ride and attractive styling, some owners have reported specific issues. Engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 available in different states of tune (300 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque, or 400 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque).
