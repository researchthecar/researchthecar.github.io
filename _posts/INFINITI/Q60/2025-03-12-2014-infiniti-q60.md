The 2014 INFINITI Q60 is a sporty coupe and convertible known for its stylish design and engaging driving experience. Available engine options include the 3.7-liter V6 producing 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque (in the coupe, 325 horsepower in the convertible) and the potent 3.7-liter V6 in the IPL trim, which delivers 348 horsepower. Both engines are paired with either a 7-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission (depending on the trim and model). Owners generally appreciate the Q60's athletic handling, comfortable interior (except for the rear seats which are small), and distinctive styling. Common dislikes include the dated infotainment system and relatively poor fuel economy for its class.

**Engine**

**3.7L VQ37VHR V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil level warning light illuminating, the need to add oil more frequently than expected, and in severe cases, potential engine damage due to oil starvation.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels, use of the recommended oil type and viscosity, and potential repair or replacement of piston rings or valve stem seals if the consumption is excessive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Slipping may also occur, where the engine RPM increases without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change is the first step. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be replaced. In severe cases, a full transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Suspension Component Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension components, particularly ball joints, control arm bushings, and sway bar links. This can lead to clunking noises, reduced handling precision, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Inspection of suspension components during routine maintenance and replacement of worn parts as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the components and the extent of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System/Infotainment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can become slow to respond, freeze, or experience glitches. Navigation may become inaccurate or fail completely.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ (depending on the severity and the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Buttons**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported that the soft-touch plastic used on the interior buttons becomes sticky or tacky over time, particularly in warmer climates. This affects buttons on the radio, climate control, and other areas.
    *   Solution: Thorough cleaning with an appropriate plastic cleaner may help, but the stickiness often returns. Some owners resort to replacing the affected buttons or applying aftermarket coatings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+ (depending on cleaning supplies and replacement buttons)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 INFINITI Q60 presents a mix of common issues. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption can be a concern, potentially leading to costly repairs if left unchecked. Transmission problems, like harsh shifting, can impact the driving experience and may require maintenance or more extensive repairs. Sticky interior buttons are a frequent nuisance, while suspension wear can impact handling and safety. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential problem areas and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase.
