**Introduction**

The 2021 INFINITI Q60 is a midsize luxury sports coupe known for its sleek design, powerful engine, and advanced technology. It is powered by a standard twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine that produces 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. A twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 with 400 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque is also available. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive.

Drivers appreciate the Q60's responsive handling, comfortable and well-equipped interior, and advanced safety features. However, it also has some drawbacks, such as limited rear seat space and a somewhat stiff ride.
