The 2016 INFINITI Q60 marked a transition year as it was the final year of the second generation model before the redesign in 2017. The 2016 Q60 was available with two engine options: a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.7L Naturally Aspirated V6 engine producing 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Q60 for its stylish design and comfortable interior, but some criticisms include the outdated infotainment system and less-than-stellar fuel economy.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

No Issues Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption in the 3.7L V6 engine. This may manifest as needing to add oil more frequently than usual, or noticing a burning oil smell. It can potentially lead to engine damage if the oil level drops too low.
    * Solution: The specific solution depends on the cause. In some cases, it may be due to faulty valve stem seals, piston rings, or PCV valve. Repair or replacement of the affected components may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the specific cause and repair needed.

    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting or hesitation during gear changes. This issue may be more noticeable when accelerating or decelerating.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update for the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In other cases, replacement of valve body components or other internal transmission components may be necessary. A transmission fluid flush is also recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $2000+ (internal repairs)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Noises from Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hearing clunking or squeaking noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. This could indicate worn-out bushings, ball joints, or struts.

**Summary**

The 2016 INFINITI Q60 can experience a range of issues, with the engine (particularly the 3.7L V6) and transmission being areas of concern for some owners. Oil consumption and harsh shifting are the most concerning mechanical issues. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also relatively common. While some issues can be resolved with relatively inexpensive fixes, others may require more costly repairs. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect any used Q60 before purchase.
