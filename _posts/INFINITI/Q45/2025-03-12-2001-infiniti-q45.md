**Summary**

The 2001 INFINITI Q45 can be a comfortable and luxurious vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of several common issues. Engine problems like timing chain tensioner failure and oil leaks can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially slipping, are also a concern. Suspension problems, particularly with the air suspension (if equipped), can lead to expensive repairs. Electrical issues like instrument cluster failure can also occur.
