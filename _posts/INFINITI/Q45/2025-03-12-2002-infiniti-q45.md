The 2002 INFINITI Q45 is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, powerful engine, and refined interior.

Owners often praise the car's smooth acceleration, spacious cabin, and long-lasting reliability. However, some common complaints include electrical issues, suspension problems related to the active suspension system (if equipped), and the age-related deterioration of various components.
