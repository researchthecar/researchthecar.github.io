This combination produces 340 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque. Despite its strong reputation, the Q45 has encountered some issues that owners have reported.

**Engine**

* **4.5L V8**
    * **Timing chain failure:** Premature wear or failure of the timing chain can cause engine damage. Symptoms may include rattling noises, reduced engine power, or the engine failing to start. Repair involves replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+
    * **Intake manifold failure:** Cracks or leaks in the intake manifold can lead to vacuum leaks, reduced engine performance, and rough idling. Replacement of the intake manifold is required for a fix. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * **Oil consumption:** Excessive oil consumption can be caused by worn piston rings or valve guides. Symptoms include low oil levels and increased oil consumption between oil changes. Replacement of affected components is necessary for repair. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+

**Transmission**

* **5-speed automatic**
    * **Transmission slipping:** Inability to properly engage gears, resulting in a loss of power or transmission failure. Replacement of the transmission is the most common solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
