*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Potential solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, especially upon startup, can indicate a failing timing chain tensioner. If left unaddressed, it can lead to timing chain failure and significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner, and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, can indicate torque converter issues. Slipping between gears may also occur.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners may experience slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or harsh/abrupt shifting. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or contaminated transmission fluid.

    *   Solution: Replacing the air struts, air compressor, or air lines. Conversion to a traditional coilover suspension is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (depending on components and coilover conversion cost)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps, can indicate worn control arm bushings. This can affect handling and alignment.
