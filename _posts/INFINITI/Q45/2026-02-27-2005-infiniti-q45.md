### Summary Verdict
The 2005 INFINITI Q45 offers a luxurious driving experience, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 4.5L V8 engine can experience timing chain tensioner issues, and oil leaks are not uncommon. The 5-speed automatic transmission may develop harsh shifting problems. The active suspension system is a notable area for potential costly repairs due to leaks or pump failures. Electrical gremlins stemming from the BCM and premature alternator failure are also reported. Interior issues primarily revolve around the infotainment screen and climate control actuators. While not a universally problematic vehicle, addressing these potential issues proactively through diligent maintenance and inspection can help ensure a more reliable ownership experience.
