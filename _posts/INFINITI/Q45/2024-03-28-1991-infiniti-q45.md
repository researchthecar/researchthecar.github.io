**Engine**

**4.5L V8**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Cracks in the intake manifold gasket can cause coolant and oil to leak, leading to engine overheating and performance issues.
    * Solution: Replace intake manifold gaskets and clean affected components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt is a critical component that synchronizes the movement of the camshaft and crankshaft. Failure of the timing belt can result in catastrophic engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace timing belt and water pump (recommended).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting:** Rough or delayed shifting can be caused by worn or damaged shift solenoids or internal transmission components.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+ per axle
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Control Arm Bushing Failure:** Worn or damaged control arm bushings can cause clunking noises, misalignment, and premature tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace control arm bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** A malfunctioning alternator can affect charging and electrical systems, leading to dim lights, battery drain, and electrical component failure.
    * Solution: Replace alternator and test charging system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Ignition Coil Failure:** Faulty ignition coils can cause misfiring, reduced power, and rough running.
