The 2012 INFINITI M35h is a hybrid luxury sedan that offered a blend of performance and fuel efficiency. It featured a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 302 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A 7-speed automatic transmission was the only transmission option. The non-hybrid M37 and M56 were also available, equipped with a 3.7L V6 (330 hp) and a 5.6L V8 (420 hp) respectively, both also using the 7-speed automatic. Owners generally praised the M35h for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and impressive fuel economy for its class. However, some criticisms included the complex hybrid system, which could lead to expensive repairs, and the somewhat dated infotainment system compared to newer competitors.

**Summary**

The 2012 INFINITI M35h, while a luxurious and relatively fuel-efficient hybrid, presents some potential issues, particularly related to its hybrid system components and the transmission. The hybrid system, including the inverter and battery pack, can be expensive to repair or replace. Electrical gremlins with the navigation screen and Bluetooth connectivity are also relatively common. While the vehicle is generally reliable, these potential issues should be considered when evaluating a used 2012 INFINITI M35h. The severity and cost of potential repairs lean towards the higher end due to the complexity of the hybrid system and the luxury brand.
