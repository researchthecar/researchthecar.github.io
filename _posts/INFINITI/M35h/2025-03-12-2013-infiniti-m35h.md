The 2013 INFINITI M35h is a luxury hybrid sedan that combines performance and efficiency. It features a 3.5-liter V6 engine (302 hp, 258 lb-ft of torque) paired with a 50 kW electric motor, resulting in a combined output of 360 horsepower. The M35h offered a smooth and quiet ride, luxurious interior, and advanced technology for its time. Owners typically praise its fuel economy for a car of its size and performance, along with its comfortable ride. Common complaints include a somewhat complicated infotainment system and occasionally expensive repairs associated with the hybrid system.
