The 2017 INFINITI Q70L is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior (especially the "L" long-wheelbase version), and elegant styling. Engine options include a 3.7-liter V6, a 5.6-liter V8, and a 3.5-liter V6 hybrid. The 3.7-liter V6 produces 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. The Q70L is appreciated for its quiet cabin and available technology features. However, some owners have noted that it can feel dated compared to newer competitors, and the fuel economy isn't the best, especially with the V8. Common complaints include the infotainment system's complexity and the lack of some advanced driver-assistance features that are standard on rivals.
