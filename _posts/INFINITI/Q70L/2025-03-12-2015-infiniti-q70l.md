The 2015 INFINITI Q70L is a luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride, a spacious interior (especially in the "L" long-wheelbase version), and a stylish design. It came with several engine options, including a 3.7L V6, a 5.6L V8, and a hybrid variant with a 3.5L V6. The 3.7L V6 produces 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the Q70L's smooth ride and luxurious appointments, but some common criticisms include a dated infotainment system and relatively poor fuel economy, especially with the V8.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon cold start, especially from the front of the engine. Can lead to timing chain slack, potentially causing engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner and potentially the timing chain itself, depending on the severity of the wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.6L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. May notice blue smoke from the exhaust. Can potentially lead to engine damage if oil levels are not monitored and maintained.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause (worn piston rings, valve stem seals), the solution can range from using a heavier weight oil and more frequent oil changes to engine rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (oil changes) - $5,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**All Transmissions**
*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or inability to shift. The transmission might go into limp mode. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) related to transmission solenoids or valve body performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the valve body. In some cases, a transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, uneven ride height, excessively bouncy ride. Compressor may run constantly or not at all. Diagnostic codes related to the air suspension system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air springs, compressor, or potentially the air suspension control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+

**Summary**

The 2015 INFINITI Q70L can present some notable issues. The most severe and costly problems tend to be related to the engine (timing chain tensioner failure, oil consumption) and the transmission (valve body). Electrical issues with the infotainment system can also be frustrating. The air suspension (if equipped) is another potential source of expensive repairs. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase.
