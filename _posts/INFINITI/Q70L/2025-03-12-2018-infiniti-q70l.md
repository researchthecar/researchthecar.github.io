The 2018 INFINITI Q70L is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior (especially in the "L" long-wheelbase variant), and stylish design. Engine options include a 3.7-liter V6 producing 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.6-liter V8 generating 416 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Q70L's smooth ride and refined interior. Common criticisms include its dated infotainment system and lower fuel economy compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may originate from the valve cover gaskets or the front timing cover gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the vehicle, oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets or resealing the front timing cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the source of the leak and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.6L V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the V6, the V8 can also experience oil leaks from valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or timing cover. Symptoms are the same as with the V6.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or resealing the timing cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the source of the leak and labor rates.

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of harsh or abrupt shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can resolve the issue. More severe cases might require valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush and software update) to $1000+ (valve body repair/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Reports indicate that some Q70L models may experience premature wear of suspension bushings, particularly in the front control arms. This can lead to clunking noises during bumps and potentially affect handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings or, in some cases, the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the extent of the damage and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lag**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The infotainment system, while feature-rich, is sometimes criticized for being slow or freezing, especially when using navigation or multiple functions simultaneously.
    *   Solution: Software updates may improve performance. In severe cases, replacement of the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $500+ (head unit replacement, if out of warranty).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle sits unused for several days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from one or more electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
