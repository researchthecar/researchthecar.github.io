The 2016 INFINITI Q70L is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. It comes in several trims, including the 3.7, 3.7 AWD, 5.6, and 5.6 AWD. The base engine is a 3.7-liter V6 producing 330 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. Upgrading to the 5.6-liter V8 boosts output to 416 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Q70L for its smooth ride, powerful engine options (especially the V8), and luxurious features. Criticisms typically focus on the car's dated infotainment system and less-than-stellar fuel economy compared to competitors.
