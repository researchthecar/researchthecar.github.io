### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Infiniti FX45 is a capable luxury SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues that can arise with age. The V8 engine, while powerful, can experience oil leaks and timing chain tensioner wear. The automatic transmission may develop shifting problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings are prone to wear, and if equipped with air suspension, leaks are a possibility. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior paint can suffer from clear coat degradation, and interior leather may show signs of wear. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential problems are crucial for maintaining the reliability and value of the FX45.
