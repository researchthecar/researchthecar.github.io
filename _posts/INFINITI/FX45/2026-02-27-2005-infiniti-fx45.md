### Summary Verdict
The 2005 INFINITI FX45, powered by its robust 4.5L V8 engine, generally offers a solid ownership experience. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as oil leaks from valve covers, wear in the timing chain tensioners, and potential transmission problems like harsh shifting. Suspension components, particularly control arm bushings and struts, can also require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or instrument cluster, and occasional infotainment system glitches are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most frequent non-routine repairs for this model. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can mitigate many of these potential costs.
