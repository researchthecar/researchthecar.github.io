It comes with a 4.5-liter V8 engine, producing around 320 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. It was praised for its performance, luxurious interior, and ample cargo space. Common complaints often revolved around its fuel economy, firm ride, and somewhat cramped rear seating for taller passengers. The FX35 has a 3.5L V6 available and the FX50 has a 5.0L V8 available. Both are paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**4.5L V8 (VK45DE)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. The engine may also exhibit blue smoke from the exhaust, indicating oil burning.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and using a heavier weight oil might mitigate the issue temporarily. A more permanent solution could involve replacing valve stem seals or piston rings, depending on the source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on severity and repair required
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise on startup, especially when the engine is cold. This indicates a potential issue with the timing chain tensioners, which can lead to timing chain failure if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioners and potentially the timing chain itself to prevent further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly. These symptoms often point to a problem with the valve body, which controls the flow of transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body, which might also include flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at highway speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, or a complete failure to engage gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter and flushing the transmission fluid to remove any debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lower Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision and uneven tire wear can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front lower control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Air Suspension Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or both sides, especially overnight. The air compressor may run excessively to compensate for the leak.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air struts or air springs and checking the air compressor for wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per strut/spring
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for an extended period. This can be due to a faulty module or parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may flicker, display distorted images, or fail completely. This is often due to a failing screen or internal components within the navigation unit.
    *   Solution: Replacing the navigation screen or the entire navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or it may make unusual noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate struts, motor, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof jams, does not fully close, or makes grinding noises when operating.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the sunroof motor, track, or cables.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 INFINITI FX45 presents a mix of potential issues. Engine problems like oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failure can be costly if left unaddressed. Transmission issues with the valve body and torque converter can also lead to expensive repairs. Suspension and electrical problems, while generally less severe, can contribute to overall ownership costs. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to assess the condition of these key components. The most common issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand to fix, depending on the severity of the problem.
