The 2010 INFINITI QX56 marked a significant departure from its predecessor, moving to a Nissan Patrol-based platform. It was only available with a 5.6-liter V8 engine (VK56VD) producing 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the QX56 for its spacious interior, luxurious features, and strong towing capability. Common criticisms include its large size, relatively poor fuel economy, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2010 INFINITI QX56 is known for its luxury and capabilities, but it's not without its potential problems. The most significant issues tend to revolve around the engine, transmission, and suspension systems. Timing chain tensioner failure and torque converter issues can lead to expensive repairs. Electrical gremlins and interior component failures are also concerns to be aware of. Overall, the severity of potential issues ranges from moderate to severe, and the cost of repairs can be significant. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
