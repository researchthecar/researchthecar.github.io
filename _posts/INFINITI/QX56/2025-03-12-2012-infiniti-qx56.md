The 2012 INFINITI QX56 is a full-size luxury SUV known for its powerful engine, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It was offered with a single engine and transmission configuration: a 5.6-liter V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. People often praised the QX56 for its towing capacity, luxurious features, and smooth ride. Some criticisms included its large size, lower fuel economy, and occasionally cumbersome handling.

**Engine**

**5.6L VK56VD V8**

* **Timing Chain Guide Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A ticking or rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup, indicates potential timing chain guide wear or failure. This can lead to poor engine performance, misfires, and in severe cases, engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause (e.g., worn piston rings, valve stem seals). Repair or replacement of the affected components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration during light acceleration, especially between 30-50 mph. This is often caused by degradation of the transmission fluid or internal wear within the torque converter.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush, replacement of the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission may hesitate before shifting, or shift with a harsh jolt. This can be due to low or contaminated transmission fluid, worn valve body components, or internal damage.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush, valve body repair or replacement, transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Failure (Rear)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sags or sits lower than normal, especially overnight. The air compressor may run constantly or not at all. This indicates a leak in the air springs, lines, or failure of the compressor.
    * Solution: Replacement of the air springs, air lines, or air compressor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Navigation/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may freeze, become unresponsive, or display error messages. The audio system may cut out or fail to connect to Bluetooth devices.
    * Solution: Software update, replacement of the navigation unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery repeatedly dies, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for a short period of time. This may be due to a parasitic draw from a faulty electrical component.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the electrical system to identify the source of the draw. Repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Power Liftgate Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or may make a loud grinding noise. This can be due to a faulty liftgate motor, struts, or latch mechanism.
    * Solution: Replacement of the liftgate motor, struts, or latch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Seat Heater Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to warm up or may only heat up intermittently. This can be due to a faulty heating element or control module.
    * Solution: Replacement of the heating element or control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 INFINITI QX56, while luxurious and powerful, can suffer from a range of issues. The most common problems involve the engine (timing chain guides, oil consumption), transmission (torque converter shudder, shifting issues), and suspension (air suspension failure). Electrical problems with the navigation system and battery drain are also prevalent. Exterior issues mainly revolve around the power liftgate. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine or transmission repairs, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
