The 2009 Infiniti QX56 is a full-size luxury SUV that offered a blend of comfort, capability, and style. It came equipped with a 5.6-liter V8 engine (VK56DE) producing 320 horsepower and 393 lb-ft of torque. The QX56 was only offered with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised its spacious interior, powerful engine, and towing capacity. Common complaints included its large size making it difficult to maneuver, poor fuel economy, and relatively dated technology compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**5.6L V8 (VK56DE)**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, especially upon cold starts, indicates a potential issue with the timing chain tensioner. If left unaddressed, this can lead to timing chain failure, resulting in severe engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner, guides, and possibly the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be caused by worn valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions range from using a thicker oil to replacing the valve stem seals or piston rings. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source of the consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift altogether can indicate a problem with the valve body. This component controls the flow of transmission fluid to different parts of the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. Fluid flush and filter change are often recommended as part of the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Self-Leveling Rear Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The QX56's self-leveling rear suspension uses air shocks or hydraulic struts to maintain a consistent ride height. Issues can include sagging rear end, compressor failure, or leaks in the air lines or shocks/struts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected components, such as the air compressor, air shocks/struts, or air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or the vehicle failing to start after being parked for a short period can point to a parasitic draw, where an electrical component is draining the battery even when the vehicle is off.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component. This often requires specialized diagnostic equipment and expertise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Entertainment System Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation and entertainment system can experience various failures, including screen malfunction, freezing, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Resetting the system, updating the software, or replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or may become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate motor, struts, or related sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to heat or become excessively hot.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating element or the seat heater control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, make noise while opening/closing, or leak.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks, replacing the sunroof motor, or replacing the sunroof seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Infiniti QX56 has a mixture of issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues such as timing chain tensioner failure and oil consumption can be costly to address. The transmission valve body problems can lead to shifting issues that affect the drivability. Electrical and suspension issues are common and potentially expensive.
