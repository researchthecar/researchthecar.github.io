*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon start-up, especially when cold. This is due to a loss of oil pressure in the tensioner, causing the timing chain to slap against the guides. If left unaddressed, it can lead to significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, guides, and potentially the timing chain itself if it has stretched.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420, P0430). Decreased engine performance and fuel economy may also be noticeable.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (per converter)
    *   Recalls: None Found
