### Summary Verdict
The 2008 INFINITI QX56 is a generally reliable large SUV, with its robust 5.6L V8 engine being a strong point. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the transmission, particularly the 5-speed automatic, which can exhibit harsh shifting. Suspension components, especially the air suspension system if equipped, can develop leaks or wear over time. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or infotainment system, are also noted. Interior climate control blend door actuators can fail, affecting temperature regulation. While not overwhelmingly problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these areas and factor in potential repair costs, especially for a vehicle of this age.
