The 2008 INFINITI QX56 is a full-size luxury SUV known for its powerful engine, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It came standard with a 5.6-liter V8 engine producing 320 horsepower and 393 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Some people appreciate its towing capacity and luxurious features, while others find it to be large and cumbersome, with relatively poor fuel economy.
