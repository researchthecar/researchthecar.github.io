The 2008 INFINITI M45 is a mid-size luxury sedan that offered a blend of performance and comfort. This model year came with two engine options: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 275 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque and a 4.5-liter V8 generating 325 horsepower and 336 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the M45 for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. Some common dislikes include its fuel economy and potentially costly repairs due to its age and luxury status.

**Summary**

The 2008 INFINITI M45 can present several issues common for vehicles of its age and luxury segment. Engine issues like oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failure (V8 models) can be costly, while transmission problems like valve body malfunctions are also relatively common. Suspension issues, especially air strut leaks, and electrical problems, such as fuel gauge inaccuracies and navigation system failures, further contribute to the potential ownership costs. Overall, while the M45 offers a luxurious and powerful driving experience, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate to severe, and the associated costs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem and repair required.
