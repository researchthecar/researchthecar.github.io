The 2009 INFINITI M45 is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a blend of performance and comfort. It was available with two engine options: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 270 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.5-liter V8 generating 325 horsepower and 336 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the M45 for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior, but common complaints include higher than average fuel consumption, some reliability concerns, and outdated technology compared to newer vehicles.

**Engine**

**4.5L V8 (VK45DE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning light, blue smoke from the exhaust (though not always present), and the need to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles.
    *   Solution: The source can vary, but often it is worn piston rings or valve stem seals. Replacing the piston rings and/or valve stem seals can address the issue, but this is a major engine repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. If left unattended, this can lead to more serious engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner, guides, and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the V8, some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning light, blue smoke from the exhaust (though not always present), and the need to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles.
    *   Solution: The source can vary, but often it is worn piston rings or valve stem seals. Replacing the piston rings and/or valve stem seals can address the issue, but this is a major engine repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   No Issues Found.

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Self-Leveling System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The M45 is equipped with a rear suspension self-leveling system, which can develop leaks or component failures. Symptoms include a sagging rear end, especially when loaded, and a bumpy ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts, compressor, or other components of the self-leveling system. Some owners opt to convert to a traditional suspension setup to avoid future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut if replacing with OEM parts; cost varies significantly depending on the chosen solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System/Infotainment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system and infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or failure. The screen can become unresponsive or display incorrect information.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, replacement of the entire navigation unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for software updates (if available); $500 - $1,500+ for replacement unit (depending on whether new, used, or aftermarket).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, even when the vehicle is not in use. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty component or electrical system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic drain and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture builds up inside the headlight housing.
    * Solution: Remove headlight assembly, unplug all the light sockets and let the moisture evaporate. Seal the seams of the assembly with silicone.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $50 for the sealant, or several hundred to replace the assembly
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof becomes stuck or fails to open/close properly.
    * Solution: Clean the sunroof rails and tracks, or replace the sunroof motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $20 for lubricant and cleaner, or $200 - $500+ for a motor replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 INFINITI M45 offers a luxurious driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The most significant concerns involve the 4.5L V8 engine's potential for excessive oil consumption and timing chain tensioner issues, and the rear suspension self-leveling system. Electrical issues with the navigation/infotainment system and battery drain can also be problematic. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, particularly engine and suspension work. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the M45's performance and extend its lifespan.
