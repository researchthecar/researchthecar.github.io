The 2006 INFINITI M45 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its powerful engine, sporty handling, and comfortable interior. It was offered with one engine option: a 4.5-liter V8 (VK45DE) producing 335 horsepower and 340 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the M45 for its performance and distinctive styling, but some common complaints include higher fuel consumption than comparable vehicles and some reliability issues related to the age of the car.
