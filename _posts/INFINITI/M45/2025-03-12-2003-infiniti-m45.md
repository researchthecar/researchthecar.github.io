The 2003 INFINITI M45 is a full-size luxury sedan known for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. It came with a single engine option: a 4.5-liter V8 (VK45DE) producing 340 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the M45's performance and comfortable interior but often note its age-related maintenance needs and fuel economy as downsides.

**Summary:** The 2003 INFINITI M45, while a powerful and luxurious sedan, is now over 20 years old, so owners should expect age-related maintenance issues. Common complaints revolve around engine maintenance (specifically leaks and timing chain issues), transmission wear, suspension components, and electrical glitches. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively inexpensive fixes (gaskets, polishing headlights) to more costly repairs (transmission rebuild, timing chain replacement). The estimated cost can be as little as $50 for minor repairs, and go up to $4000+ for more intense issues.
