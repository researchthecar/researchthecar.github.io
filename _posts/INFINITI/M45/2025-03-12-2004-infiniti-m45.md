**Engine**

**4.5L VK45DE V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can occur, with some owners reporting needing to add oil frequently between changes. This can lead to fouled spark plugs, catalytic converter damage, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed. Blue smoke from the exhaust is a common symptom.
    *   Solution: The underlying cause could be worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help pinpoint the source. Depending on the severity, repair options range from replacing valve stem seals to a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+ (depending on the extent of repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the timing chain tensioners can lead to a rattling noise, particularly at startup. If left unattended, this can result in timing chain slack, potentially causing engine misfires or even catastrophic engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioners, and possibly the timing chain itself, is the recommended repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, harsh shifting, or failure to shift can be attributed to problems within the transmission's valve body. Debris accumulation and wear can impede the proper function of the solenoids and valves responsible for controlling fluid flow.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and fluid change might temporarily alleviate the issue, but a valve body replacement or rebuild is often necessary for a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Self-Leveling Suspension Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2004 M45 was available with a self-leveling rear suspension. This system is prone to failure over time. Symptoms include the rear of the car sagging, a bouncy ride, and/or the compressor making excessive noise.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air springs and/or the compressor. Conversion to a traditional coil spring suspension is also a common solution, though it eliminates the self-leveling feature.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (depending on the repair and parts used)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises in the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. It can also affect handling and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per control arm)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window motor failure prevents the window from moving up or down.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failures of gauges, such as the speedometer or tachometer, or dimming of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding/Yellowing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the plastic headlight lenses can become cloudy or yellowed, reducing headlight brightness and visibility.
    *   Solution: Headlight restoration kits can improve the clarity of the lenses. In severe cases, headlight replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100 (for restoration kit) or $300 - $800+ (for headlight replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory navigation system, if equipped, is prone to failure due to its age. Common issues include screen malfunctions, inability to read discs, and inaccurate GPS data.
    *   Solution: Replacement with an aftermarket unit or repair of the existing system (parts availability may be limited).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the repair or replacement option)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 INFINITI M45, while offering a rewarding driving experience, is prone to certain age-related issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failure, can be costly to address. Transmission issues related to the valve body, suspension problems with the self-leveling system, and electrical gremlins are also common concerns. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem and the chosen repair method.
