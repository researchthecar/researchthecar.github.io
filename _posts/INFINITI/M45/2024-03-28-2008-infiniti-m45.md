**Introduction to the 2008 INFINITI M45**

The 2008 INFINITI M45 is a luxurious sports sedan known for its elegant design, powerful performance, and advanced technology. It was offered with a 4.5-liter V8 engine rated at 325 horsepower and 336 pound-feet of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The M45 was appreciated for its smooth and responsive handling, comfortable interior, and impressive fuel economy for its size. However, it also faced criticism for its relatively small trunk and lack of driver aids compared to newer models.

**Engine**

**4.5-Liter V8**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, leading to a vacuum leak that causes rough idling, poor fuel economy, and reduced power. Replacing the gasket resolves the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** The valve cover gaskets can leak oil, causing a burning smell and potential engine damage if left unattended. Replacing the gaskets fixes the problem. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slippage:** Some early models experienced transmission slippage, especially when shifting into higher gears. Reflashing the transmission control module (TCM) or replacing the transmission may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mount Failure:** The front strut mounts can prematurely wear out, leading to noise and vibration when driving over uneven surfaces. Replacing the strut mounts restores ride quality. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** In some cases, the battery can drain prematurely due to a faulty alternator or parasitic draw. Replacing the alternator or identifying and fixing the source of the draw resolves the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system can experience various issues, such as inoperative buttons, fan speed problems, or temperature regulation failures. Replacement of faulty components may be required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+

**Exterior**

* **Trims and Moldings:** The exterior trims and moldings can become loose or damaged over time, especially on older models. Reattaching or replacing the affected parts improves aesthetics and prevents further damage. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Interior**

* **Navigation Screen Issues:** The navigation system screen may experience glitches, such as freezing or displaying incorrect information. A software update or replacement of the screen may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
* **Dashboard Rattle:** Some models exhibit a rattling noise from the dashboard, which can be caused by loose components or poor assembly. Securing or replacing the affected parts eliminates the rattle. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500

**Summary**

Overall, the 2008 INFINITI M45 is a generally reliable and enjoyable vehicle. While it has some known issues, most of them are relatively minor and inexpensive to repair. However, some more severe problems, such as transmission slippage or electrical malfunctions, can be costly to fix and may require professional attention.
