The 2007 INFINITI M45 is a mid-size luxury sedan that blends performance with comfort. It was offered with two engine options: a 4.5-liter V8 engine (VK45DE) producing 325 horsepower and 336 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, and a 3.5-liter V6 engine (VQ35DE) which is not the focus of this particular request. The M45 is generally praised for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, and stylish interior. However, some owners have reported issues with electrical components, suspension, and the engine. This guide will outline common problems experienced by owners of the 2007 INFINITI M45 with the 4.5L V8 engine.

**Engine**

**4.5L V8 (VK45DE)**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored closely. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be observed.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels and using heavier weight oil may help in some cases. In more severe cases, piston rings or valve stem seals may need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and extent of repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. This can indicate a failing timing chain tensioner, which can lead to timing chain slap and potentially catastrophic engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner and potentially the timing chain itself.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

* **5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Slipping/Hard Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, harsh or delayed shifting between gears, or transmission slipping. These issues can stem from degraded transmission fluid, worn valve body components, or internal mechanical failure.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush may resolve minor issues. For more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps or during braking. Uneven tire wear and wandering steering can also be symptoms.
    * Solution: Replacement of the front lower control arm bushings. Some owners opt to replace the entire control arm assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side (depending on whether bushings or entire control arm are replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Suspension Self Leveling Air Shock Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicleâ€™s rear may sag when parked or while driving. The air compressor may run continuously or more frequently than normal. Reduced ride quality and bottoming out over bumps can also occur.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking air shocks. Conversion to standard shocks and springs is a less costly, permanent solution
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per shock, $500-1000+ for conversion kit
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Navigation System Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may freeze, display incorrect information, or fail to power on.
    * Solution: Depending on the severity, the navigation unit may need to be reset, updated, or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reset/update) - $1,500+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The door lock may not lock or unlock with the key fob or door switch.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing.
    * Solution: Replacing the headlight assembly or resealing the existing unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, make grinding noises, or fail to open or close completely.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, track, or other components.
