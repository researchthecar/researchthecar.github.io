Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 INFINITI QX70, formatted for your website.

The 2019 INFINITI QX70 is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its sporty handling and distinctive styling. It comes standard with a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 325 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its attractive design and enjoyable driving dynamics. Common criticisms include a cramped rear seat, limited cargo space, and outdated technology compared to newer competitors. The QX70 was discontinued after the 2017 model year, but the 2019 models are basically carryovers, so they are very similar and have similar issues.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil changes or topping off between scheduled services. This may manifest as low oil level warnings or visible exhaust smoke in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and timely oil changes are crucial. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection may be necessary to check for leaks, valve seal issues, or piston ring problems. The solution can range from replacing valve seals to piston ring replacement or a complete engine rebuild.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some vehicles experience premature wear or failure of the timing chain components. This can lead to engine rattling noises, especially upon startup, and potentially cause engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: The solution involves replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. Inspection of other related components (e.g., sprockets) is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
