The 2018 INFINITI QX70 is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its sporty handling and distinctive styling. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 325 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the QX70 for its sleek design, powerful engine, and comfortable front seats. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space, a relatively small cargo area, and dated technology compared to newer competitors.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between regularly scheduled oil changes. This can sometimes be linked to worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: A mechanic can perform an oil consumption test to determine the severity. If excessive consumption is confirmed, the potential solutions can range from using a thicker oil to replacing the piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the specific cause and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon cold start, especially in colder climates. This can indicate a failing timing chain tensioner, which can lead to serious engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner and potentially the timing chain itself, especially if the issue has been present for a significant period.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifts, particularly when shifting between gears or accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, a fluid flush and filter replacement may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, further diagnosis by a qualified technician may be needed to identify and address any underlying mechanical or electrical problems within the transmission. This could include replacing solenoids or valve bodies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300+ for fluid change to $1,500 - $4,000+ for more extensive repairs
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. This can indicate worn-out suspension bushings, particularly in the control arms and sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings. Depending on the extent of the wear, it may be necessary to replace the entire control arm or sway bar link assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner, depending on the parts replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, even when the vehicle is not in use, which could be a result of a parasitic draw somewhere in the electrical system. This can lead to starting problems or the need to frequently jump-start the vehicle.
    *   Solution: A mechanic needs to perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Once the faulty component is identified, it can be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or experience random glitches such as the screen flickering or the audio cutting out.
    *   Solution: Try performing a system reset. If the problem persists, it may be necessary to update the software or replace the infotainment system unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ (depending on the severity and required solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may not open or close properly, may make unusual noises, or may stop working altogether.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts and motor for any signs of damage or wear. Replace any faulty components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, make excessive noise, or leak when closed.
    *   Solution: Check sunroof tracks and clean out any debris that may be interfering with its operation. Lubricate the tracks. If the motor is faulty, it may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $700+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 INFINITI QX70 has some notable potential issues to be aware of. The engine's oil consumption and timing chain tensioner problems are serious and can be costly to repair. Transmission issues can affect the driving experience. Electrical problems like battery drain and infotainment glitches can also be frustrating. Suspension bushing wear is also something to keep in mind as the vehicle ages. While some issues may be relatively minor, others can be expensive to address, potentially making pre-purchase inspections and maintenance records particularly important when considering this vehicle.
