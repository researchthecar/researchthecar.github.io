**Summary**

The 2020 INFINITI QX70 can present owners with a range of issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the V8 models, are a significant concern due to the high potential repair costs. Transmission issues, while potentially addressable with fluid changes, can also escalate into expensive rebuilds. Suspension and electrical problems contribute to the overall ownership experience, and the repair costs can vary widely depending on the severity. While not every QX70 will experience all of these issues, potential buyers should be aware of these common problem areas and factor them into their purchasing decision.
