The 2016 INFINITI QX70 is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its sporty handling and distinctive styling. It offers a comfortable ride and a well-appointed interior. The QX70 came with two engine options: a 3.7L V6 producing 325 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L V8 producing 390 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission.
