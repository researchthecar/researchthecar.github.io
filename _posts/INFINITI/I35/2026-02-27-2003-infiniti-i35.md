### Summary Verdict
The 2003 INFINITI I35 offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly concerning its powertrain when properly maintained. The 3.5L V6 engine is robust, though common issues like oil leaks from valve covers and potential timing chain tensioner wear should be monitored. The automatic transmission is also generally dependable, but some instances of harsh shifting have been reported, often addressable with fluid services or minor component replacements. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical issues, particularly related to the Body Control Module and alternator, are the most notable potential weak points. Interior components like climate control blend doors and power seat actuators can also develop faults. Overall, the I35 is a solid choice, but owners should be aware of these specific areas for potential maintenance and repair.
