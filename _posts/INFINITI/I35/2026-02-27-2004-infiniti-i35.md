### Summary Verdict
The 2004 INFINITI I35 is a generally reliable luxury sedan, particularly known for its potent V6 engine. Common issues tend to be related to aging components such as gasket leaks (timing chain cover, intake manifold), and potential wear in the automatic transmission, leading to harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins stemming from the BCM and alternator failures are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, causing noise and handling issues. Interior comfort can be affected by HVAC blower motor failures or power seat malfunctions. While not immune to problems, most issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, making it a potentially good value if well-maintained.
