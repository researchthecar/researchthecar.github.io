**Introduction**

The 2003 INFINITI I35 is a compact luxury sedan powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. It offers a comfortable and spacious interior, along with a smooth and responsive driving experience. Owners appreciate its reliability, refinement, and performance, while some find it lacking in certain features compared to rivals.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Leaking coolant from the intake manifold gasket, leading to overheating and engine damage. Requires gasket replacement. $400 - $700+
* **Throttle position sensor issues:** Malfunctioning throttle position sensor can cause erratic engine behavior, including stalling, hesitation, and poor fuel economy. Replacement of the sensor is necessary. $200 - $400+
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** Worn or defective timing chain tensioner can result in chain skipping or breakage, leading to catastrophic engine damage. Timing chain and tensioner replacement are required. $1,500 - $2,000+

**Transmission**

**5-speed Automatic**

* **Slipping transmission:** Transmission slipping under load or at higher speeds, leading to lack of power and potential failure. Transmission rebuild or replacement is typically required. $2,500 - $4,000+
* **Shift solenoid failure:** Malfunctioning shift solenoid can cause delayed or erratic gear shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gears. Replacement of the solenoid is necessary. $300 - $600+
* **Transmission fluid leak:** Leaks from the transmission pan or seals can cause loss of fluid and potential transmission damage. Leak source repair or seal replacement is needed. $200 - $500+

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** Premature alternator failure, leading to insufficient charging of the battery. Replacement of the alternator is required. $500 - $800+
* **Battery drain:** Parasitic battery drain, causing the battery to discharge prematurely. Identifying and устранение the source of the drain is necessary. $100 - $300+
* **Starter motor issues:** Malfunctioning starter motor can result in difficulty starting the engine or complete failure. Replacement of the starter is required. $300 - $600+

**Exterior**

* **Headlight condensation:** Moisture accumulation inside the headlight housings, affecting visibility. Replacement of the headlight assemblies may be required. $500 - $1,000+

**Interior**

* **Navigation system glitches:** Occasional glitches or freezing of the navigation system. Software updates or replacement of the navigation module may address the issue. $300 - $600+
* **Climate control issues:** Malfunctioning climate control system, leading to temperature regulation problems or inconsistent airflow. Diagnosis and repair of the system is necessary. $200 - $500+

**Summary**

The 2003 INFINITI I35 is generally a reliable vehicle, but it is not immune to certain issues. Engine problems, such as intake manifold gasket failure and timing chain tensioner failure, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues and electrical problems can also arise, while suspension and exterior issues are less common. Overall, the severity and cost of potential issues should be considered when evaluating this vehicle.
