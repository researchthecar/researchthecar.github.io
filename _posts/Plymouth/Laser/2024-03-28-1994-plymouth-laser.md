**Introduction:**

The 1994 Plymouth Laser is a sporty coupe that offered a choice of engines and transmissions. The base engine was a 2.0L inline-4 with 135 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. An optional 2.4L inline-4 produced 160 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and came with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.

Drivers appreciate the Laser's nimble handling and stylish design, but criticize its cramped interior and limited rear visibility.
