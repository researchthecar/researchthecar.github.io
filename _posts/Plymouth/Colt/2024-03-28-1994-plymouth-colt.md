**1994 Plymouth Colt**

The 1994 Plymouth Colt was a subcompact car available in sedan, coupe, and convertible body styles. The Colt offered two engine options: a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder with 88 horsepower and 95 lb-ft of torque and a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder with 113 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

The Colt was praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and reliability, but it was criticized for its lack of power and unrefined interior.
