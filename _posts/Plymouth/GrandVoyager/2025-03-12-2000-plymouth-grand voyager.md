The 2000 Plymouth Grand Voyager was a popular minivan known for its versatility and practicality. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing around 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, a 3.3L V6 producing around 158 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 producing around 180 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. All engine options were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Grand Voyager's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly features. However, common complaints included reliability issues, particularly with the transmission, as well as electrical problems and premature wear of certain components.

**Summary**

The 2000 Plymouth Grand Voyager, while practical, is prone to several common issues. The most significant problems often involve the transmission, which can lead to costly repairs. Engine issues like intake manifold gasket leaks and crankshaft position sensor failures are also prevalent. Electrical problems with power door locks, windows, and the radio/instrument cluster can add to the maintenance burden. While individual repair costs may vary, addressing these issues can quickly accumulate.
