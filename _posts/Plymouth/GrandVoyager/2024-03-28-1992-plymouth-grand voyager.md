**Introduction:**

The 1992 Plymouth Grand Voyager is a minivan offered with a choice of three engines and two transmissions. The base engine is a 3.0L V6 with 135 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. An optional 3.3L V6 produces 150 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, while a 3.8L V6 generates 162 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque. Both V6 engines are paired with a 3-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.3L V6 can be upgraded to a 4-speed automatic. The Grand Voyager received praise for its spacious interior and comfortable ride, but criticism for its lackluster performance and below-average fuel economy.

**Summary:**

The 1992 Plymouth Grand Voyager is a spacious and comfortable minivan, but it has its fair share of potential issues. The most severe and costly problem is the timing chain guide failure on the 3.8L V6 engine. Other common issues include cylinder head gasket failure on the 3.0L V6, and transmission slipping or shuddering on both available transmissions. While many of the other problems are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, the overall cost of repairs can add up over time.
