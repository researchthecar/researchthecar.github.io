**1998 Plymouth Neon**

The 1998 Plymouth Neon was a compact car available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base model came with a 2.0-liter SOHC inline-four engine producing 132 horsepower and 160 pound-feet of torque. A more powerful 2.0-liter SOHC inline-four with 150 horsepower and 185 pound-feet of torque was optional. Both engines could be paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Neon was praised for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and sporty handling. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, cheap interior, and poor reliability.
