The 2000 Plymouth Breeze was a compact sedan offered as a more budget-friendly alternative to its Chrysler and Dodge counterparts. It came standard with a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing 132 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. A 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 150 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque was also available, exclusively with the 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the Breeze for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Common complaints included underwhelming performance from the base engine, uninspired styling, and some reliability concerns.
