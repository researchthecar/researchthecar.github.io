**Introduction:**

The 1990 Plymouth Horizon was a compact hatchback that offered a budget-friendly transportation option. It was available with a variety of engine and transmission combinations, including a 1.6L I4 engine and a 3-speed automatic transmission. The Horizon was praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and reliability, but it also had its share of issues.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4 Engine**

* **Head gasket failure:** This is a common issue on the 1.6L engine, especially in high-mileage vehicles. Symptoms include coolant leaks, overheating, and engine misfiring. The solution is to replace the head gasket, which can cost around $500 - $700+.
* **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt is a critical component that synchronizes the timing of the engine's components. Failure of the timing belt can result in catastrophic engine damage. The recommended replacement interval for the timing belt is 100,000 miles, and replacements typically cost around $200 - $400.
* **Oil leaks:** The 1.6L engine is prone to oil leaks from various locations, including the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and crankshaft seal. The severity and cost of the repair will depend on the location and extent of the leak.

**Transmission**

**3-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shifting problems:** This is a common issue on the 3-speed automatic transmission, especially in older vehicles. Symptoms can include difficulty shifting gears, slipping gears, or transmission shuddering. The solution may involve replacing or repairing the transmission, which can cost around $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **Fluid leaks:** The 3-speed automatic transmission is also prone to fluid leaks, which can lead to low fluid levels and transmission damage. The solution is to identify and repair the source of the leak, which can cost around $200 - $500+.

**Exterior**

* **Rust**: The Horizon is prone to rust, especially around the wheel wells, rockers, and undercarriage. The severity and cost of rust repairs will depend on the extent of the rust damage.
* **Body panel damage**: The Horizon is also prone to body panel damage, especially in the front bumper and rear end. The cost of body panel repairs will depend on the extent of the damage.

**Interior**

* **Plastic parts breaking:** The plastic interior parts in the Horizon are prone to breaking, especially the dashboard, door panels, and center console. The cost of replacing these parts will vary depending on the specific part.
* **Seat fabric tearing:** The seat fabric in the Horizon is also prone to tearing, especially in high-mileage vehicles. The cost of replacing the seat fabric will depend on the extent of the tear.

**Summary**

The 1990 Plymouth Horizon is a budget-friendly vehicle that offers good fuel efficiency and reliability. However, it is not without its issues. The most common problems are related to the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the specific problem.
