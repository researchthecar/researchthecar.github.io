**Introduction**

The 1990 Plymouth Sundance was a compact car available with a range of engine and transmission options. Its 1.6L engine produced 82 horsepower and 91 lb-ft of torque. While the Sundance was praised for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and spacious interior, it also had several known issues.

**Engine**

* **1.6L SOHC 4-Cylinder**
    * **Head Gasket Failure:** Blown gasket causes coolant and oil to mix, leading to overheating and engine damage.
        * Solution: Replace head gasket and rebuild engine.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
        * Recalls: None Found
* **Fuel Injector Malfunction:** Clogged or faulty fuel injectors cause engine misfires, rough idling, and decreased power.
        * Solution: Clean or replace fuel injectors.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
        * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

* **3-Speed Automatic**
    * **Leaking Transmission Fluid:** Worn seals or gaskets cause fluid leaks, leading to reduced performance and transmission failure.
        * Solution: Replace seals or gaskets and top up transmission fluid.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500
        * Recalls: None Found
* **Gear Slipping:** Worn clutch plates or gears cause gears to slip out of place, resulting in transmission jerking or loss of power.
        * Solution: Replace worn components or rebuild transmission.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
        * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts:** Weak or worn struts compromise handling and ride quality, causing excessive bouncing and poor braking.
        * Solution: Replace struts.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
        * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Faulty Alternator:** Alternator failure prevents the battery from charging, leading to electrical problems and engine stalling.
        * Solution: Replace alternator.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500
        * Recalls: None Found
* **Electrical Short:** Shorts in the electrical system can cause flickering lights, battery drain, or even fire hazards.
        * Solution: Diagnose and repair electrical fault.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
        * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Door Lock Malfunction:** Worn lock mechanisms or faulty actuators prevent doors from locking or unlocking properly.

        * Recalls: None Found
* **Climate Control Failure:** Malfunctioning climate control system results in ineffective heating or cooling.
        * Solution: Diagnose and repair faulty components.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
