The 2010 Nissan Urvan (also known as the Nissan Caravan in some markets) is a light commercial van known for its practicality and reliability. Engine options typically include a 2.0L or 2.5L gasoline engine, and a 2.5L diesel engine. The 2.5L QR25DE gasoline engine produced around 145 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options generally consist of a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic.
