### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Nissan Urvan is a workhorse vehicle that, while generally robust, can exhibit common issues associated with its age and commercial use. The diesel engines, particularly the QD32, may require attention to the injector pump or turbocharger. Manual transmissions can suffer from clutch wear, while automatics might develop torque converter problems. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks are prone to wear due to load-bearing duties. Electrical issues, often stemming from aging wiring harnesses or alternator failure, are also noted. Exterior rust is a significant concern, especially in humid or coastal environments. Interior wear is typical for a van of this age. Overall, the Urvan's reliability is decent for its class, but owners should be prepared for potential maintenance related to its heavy-duty nature and age.
