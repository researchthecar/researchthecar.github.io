The diesel engine, while more powerful, can be prone to issues like turbocharger and glow plug failures, which are not uncommon for this type of powertrain. Transmission reliability is decent, with manual clutches being a wear item. Suspension components like bushings and ball joints may require attention over time due to the vehicle's utility focus. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, can occur. Exterior rust is a potential concern in certain climates. Overall, with regular maintenance, the Urvan should provide dependable service, but owners of diesel models should be aware of potential powertrain-specific repairs.
