**Engine**

**4.2L V6**

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** Oil leaks from under the valve cover due to a faulty gasket. Symptoms include: oil burning smell, oil drops under the vehicle, and reduced engine oil levels. Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300
* **Spark Plug Failure:** Premature failure of spark plugs can lead to misfires, rough idling, and reduced engine performance. Solution: Replace faulty spark plugs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$100

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Fluid Leak:** Fluid leaks from the transmission due to a faulty gasket or seal. Symptoms include: low transmission fluid levels, whining or grinding noises, and slipping gears. Solution: Identify and replace the leaking component. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400
* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** Faulty shift solenoids prevent proper gear engagement. Symptoms include: delayed or harsh shifting, slipping gears, and transmission overheating. Solution: Replace affected shift solenoid(s). Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$500

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Mount Failure:** Worn or damaged strut mounts cause excess noise and vibrations during driving. Symptoms include: clunking or rattling noises over bumps, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Solution: Replace the faulty strut mount(s). Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$500
* **Rear Leaf Spring Breakage:** Broken leaf springs impair vehicle handling and stability. Symptoms include: sagging rear end, unstable driving, and decreased load capacity. Solution: Replace the broken leaf spring(s). Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$600

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** A faulty alternator can lead to battery discharge and electrical system issues. Symptoms include: dimming lights, flickering electronics, and difficulty starting the vehicle. Solution: Replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$600

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking:** The dashboard material can crack over time, especially in hot climates. Symptoms include: visible cracks on the dashboard surface, discolored or peeling material, and reduced aesthetic appeal. Solution: Replace or repair the damaged dashboard. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500
* **Air Conditioner Evaporator Core Leak:** A leaking evaporator core can lead to a refrigerant leak and impaired air conditioning performance. Symptoms include: reduced or no cold air, musty odor from the air vents, and refrigerant loss. Solution: Replace the evaporator core. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1,000
