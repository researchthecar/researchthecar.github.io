### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Nissan Urvan is a workhorse vehicle that generally offers good reliability, especially its diesel engines. Common issues tend to be related to age and mileage, such as wear on suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs, and potential for rust on the body. Electrical systems can also develop faults, with alternators and wiring harnesses being points of attention. Transmission issues, particularly clutch wear on manuals and torque converter problems on automatics, are also noted. While not immune to problems, most issues are repairable and not indicative of fundamental design flaws, making the Urvan a potentially sound investment if well-maintained.
