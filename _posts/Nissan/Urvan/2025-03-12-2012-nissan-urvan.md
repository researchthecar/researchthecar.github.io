The 2012 Nissan Urvan (also known as the Nissan NV350 Caravan in some markets) is a popular cargo van known for its practicality and reliability. It was available with a few different engine options. The most common option is the 2.5L QR25DE inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 145 horsepower and 157 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included a 2.0L gasoline engine and a 2.5L YD25DDTi diesel engine. Transmission options were typically a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine and market. Owners often praise the Urvan for its spacious cargo area, fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel engine), and relatively low running costs. Common dislikes include the basic interior, somewhat dated driving experience, and limited availability of advanced safety features.

**Summary**

The 2012 Nissan Urvan is a workhorse van that, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. Engine problems, such as excessive oil consumption in the gasoline engines and fuel injector issues in the diesel engines, can be costly to address. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic transmission, can also be a significant expense. Suspension and electrical issues are relatively common and can contribute to overall maintenance costs. While some issues are minor, others can be quite severe, potentially leading to repair bills in the thousands of dollars.
