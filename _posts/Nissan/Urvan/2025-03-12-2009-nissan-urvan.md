The 2009 Nissan Urvan (also known as the Nissan Caravan in some markets) is a popular cargo and passenger van known for its practicality and reliability. Engine options typically included a 2.5L QR25DE inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 147 hp and a 2.5L YD25DDTi turbo diesel engine producing around 127 hp. The Urvan is generally praised for its spacious interior and cargo capacity, but some owners have reported issues with certain components. Common complaints revolve around comfort, and certain mechanical aspects of the diesel engine, while the simplicity of the gasoline engine is generally appreciated.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE Inline-4 Gasoline**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, especially at higher mileage. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Check for leaks. If no leaks are present, the piston rings may be the culprit. Replacing the piston rings can solve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L YD25DDTi Turbo Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Diagnose which injector(s) are faulty and replace them. Ensure the fuel system is clean to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine bay, loss of power, and potential engine damage if the turbo fails completely.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for damage. Repair or replace the turbocharger as needed. Check oil lines to the turbo for blockage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Timing Chain Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise, especially on startup. This can lead to valve timing issues and potentially catastrophic engine damage if the chain breaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Shocks and Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shocks and struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn bushings in the control arms, sway bar links, and other suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the number of bushings needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, battery light on the dashboard, difficulty starting the engine, and eventually a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Test the alternator. Replace the alternator if it is not charging properly.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door, sticking, or requiring excessive force.
    *   Solution: Inspect and lubricate the door tracks and rollers. If the rollers are worn, replace them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the extent of the issue and parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air from the air conditioning system.
    *   Solution: Check the refrigerant level and add refrigerant if needed. If the system is properly charged, inspect the compressor, condenser, and other components for leaks or damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the cause of the problem)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Nissan Urvan/Caravan, while generally reliable, exhibits some common issues. The diesel engine, in particular, suffers from injector, turbocharger, and timing chain problems that can be costly to repair. Excessive oil consumption may affect the gasoline engine. Suspension and electrical issues are also prevalent. While these issues are not necessarily indicative of every vehicle, potential buyers should be aware of them and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase, particularly paying attention to the diesel engine and its components. Costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for major engine work.
