### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Nissan Urvan is a workhorse vehicle that, while not immune to issues, generally offers good reliability for its intended purpose. The diesel engines, particularly the TD27 and QD32, can experience issues like glow plug problems, head gasket failures, and fuel system component wear, which are not uncommon for diesel engines of this era. Transmission issues, especially clutch wear on manuals and torque converter problems on automatics, are also noted. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks are subject to wear due to the vehicle's load-carrying capacity. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and wiring corrosion can occur. Exterior rust is a common concern for older commercial vehicles, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor may require replacement. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maximizing the lifespan and reliability of the Urvan.
