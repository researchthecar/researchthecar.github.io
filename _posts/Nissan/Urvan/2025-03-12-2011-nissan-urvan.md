The 2011 Nissan Urvan, also known as the Nissan Caravan in some markets, is a light commercial van known for its practicality and cargo capacity. In many markets, the most common engine option is the 2.5L QR25DE inline-4 gasoline engine. This engine produces around 145 horsepower and 157 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included diesel engines like the YD25DDTi. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate its reliability and spaciousness, while common complaints include its basic interior and relatively outdated technology.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This is often noticed by a burning oil smell, blue smoke from the exhaust, and frequent low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly, use the manufacturer-recommended oil type and viscosity, and check for leaks. A compression test can help determine if the piston rings are worn, which is a common cause. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement of piston rings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the severity and chosen repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased power, and the engine misfire code (P0300 series codes). Can be caused by faulty ignition coils or worn spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cylinder misfiring. Replace spark plugs and/or ignition coils as needed. Inspect wiring and connectors to the coils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the components needing replacement and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**YD25DDTi Diesel Engine**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Begin by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and replacement with the correct Nissan Matic fluid may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body issues may be the cause and require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on whether a fluid change or valve body repair is required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revving without corresponding acceleration, delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is burnt or contaminated, a complete transmission overhaul or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+ for a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Resistance or grinding when attempting to shift into gear, especially 1st or reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the clutch cable or hydraulic system for proper adjustment and operation. Inspect the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing for wear or damage. Replace any worn or damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the clutch system repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revving higher than expected during acceleration, a burning smell, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing as a set. Inspect the flywheel for damage and resurface or replace as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+ depending on parts and labor.
