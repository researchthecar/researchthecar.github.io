The 2007 Nissan Urvan, also known as the Nissan Caravan in some markets, is a light commercial van prized for its practicality and cargo capacity. The primary engine option for this year is the 2.5L QR25DE inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 147 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Diesel engine options were also available in some markets, including a 2.5L turbodiesel. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Urvan's reliability and utilitarian design, but some dislike its basic interior and relatively weak engine performance, particularly when fully loaded.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE Inline-4 Gasoline**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual increase in oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs. May also present with blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, options include using a higher viscosity oil, replacing valve stem seals, or, in more severe cases, replacing the piston rings or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. Potential for misfires or engine stalling in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbodiesel (If Applicable)**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**
*   **Slipping or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates or fails to engage when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low transmission fluid, worn clutch packs, or a faulty valve body. Solutions range from a fluid flush and filter replacement to a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky gear changes, especially when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear or during downshifts.

**Summary**

The 2007 Nissan Urvan, while a reliable workhorse, does have some common issues. The engine can experience oil consumption and timing chain problems (especially the 2.5L gasoline engine), while the automatic transmission may exhibit slipping or rough shifting. Suspension components wear out over time, and electrical issues such as door lock actuator failures and alternator problems can occur. The sliding door can also be a source of frustration. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the Urvan's reliability and extend its lifespan. The most costly issues tend to be engine-related (timing chain, major oil consumption) or transmission-related (rebuild or replacement).
