### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Nissan Urvan demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly for its intended commercial use. The petrol engine options are generally trouble-free. The diesel engine, while more powerful, has a higher propensity for issues like turbocharger and injector problems, which are not uncommon for diesel powertrains of this era. Transmission reliability is decent, with manual clutches being a wear item. Electrical components like the alternator can fail, but this is a common issue across many vehicle types. The suspension, exterior, and interior components are typically robust. Regular maintenance and addressing potential diesel-specific issues promptly will contribute to long-term dependability.
