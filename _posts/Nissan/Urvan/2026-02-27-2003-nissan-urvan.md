### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Nissan Urvan is a utilitarian vehicle that, while generally robust, exhibits some common age-related issues. The diesel engines, particularly the TD27 and QD32 variants, can be prone to head gasket failures, glow plug issues, and fuel system problems like injector pump or turbocharger wear. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, may require clutch replacements or attention to torque converters and fluid leaks. Suspension components like leaf springs and bushings are also noted areas for potential repair. Electrical systems can suffer from wiring harness corrosion, and alternators may fail. Exterior rust is a significant concern for vehicles of this age, especially in certain climates. Interior wear on seats and HVAC blower motor failures are also reported. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential issues are crucial for maintaining the Urvan's reliability.
