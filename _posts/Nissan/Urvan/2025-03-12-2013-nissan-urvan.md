The 2013 Nissan Urvan, also known as the Nissan NV350, is a light commercial van appreciated for its spacious cargo area, reliability, and practicality. Engine options commonly include a 2.0L QR20DE petrol engine producing around 129 horsepower and 198 Nm of torque, a 2.5L QR25DE petrol engine, and a 2.5L YD25DDTi diesel engine. Available transmissions are typically a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally like the Urvan's robust build, ample cargo space, and fuel efficiency (particularly the diesel variants). Common dislikes include the basic interior, somewhat dated styling, and limited safety features compared to more modern vans.

**Summary**
The 2013 Nissan Urvan can have a few common issues, with the diesel engine being susceptible to injector and timing chain problems, which can be costly to repair. Other issues, such as transmission shifting problems and suspension bushing wear, are less severe but should be addressed to maintain the vehicle's reliability and handling. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the repair shop. Regular maintenance, especially fluid changes, can help prevent some of these problems.
