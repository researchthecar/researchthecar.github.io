**Introduction**

The 2006 Nissan Urvan is a full-size passenger van available with either a 3.5L V6 engine or a 2.5L diesel engine. The V6 engine produces 230 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, while the diesel engine produces 128 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Urvan is known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and reliability. However, it is not without its issues.

**Engine**

* **3.5L V6**
    * **Oil Leaks from Valve Covers:** Oil leaks from the valve covers are common on the 3.5L V6 engine. The leak can be caused by a faulty gasket or a cracked valve cover. Symptoms include oil leaking onto the engine block and a burning oil smell. Repairing the leak typically involves replacing the gaskets and/or valve covers. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * **Timing Chain Failure:** Timing chain failure is a serious issue that can occur on the 3.5L V6 engine. The timing chain is responsible for synchronizing the timing of the engine's valves and camshaft. If the timing chain fails, the engine can suffer catastrophic damage. Symptoms of timing chain failure include a rattling noise from the engine, difficulty starting, and reduced engine power. Repairing a timing chain failure typically involves replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500
* **2.5L Diesel**
    * **Fuel Injector Failure:** Fuel injector failure is a common issue on the 2.5L diesel engine. The fuel injectors can become clogged or damaged, causing the engine to run rough, misfire, and lose power. Repairing fuel injector failure typically involves replacing the faulty injectors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    * **Turbocharger Failure:** Turbocharger failure is another potential issue on the 2.5L diesel engine. The turbocharger can fail due to a variety of factors, including oil leaks, overheating, or mechanical damage. Symptoms of turbocharger failure include reduced engine power, increased exhaust smoke, and a whining noise from the engine. Repairing a turbocharger failure typically involves replacing the turbocharger. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000

**Transmission**

* **5-Speed Automatic**
    * **Transmission Slipping:** Transmission slipping is a common issue on the 5-speed automatic transmission. The transmission may slip when shifting gears or when accelerating. Symptoms include a loss of power, shuddering, or hesitation during gear changes. Repairing transmission slipping typically involves replacing the transmission fluid, filter, and/or solenoids. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000
    * **Transmission Failure:** Transmission failure is a serious issue that can occur on the 5-speed automatic transmission. The transmission may fail due to a variety of factors, including worn gears, faulty bearings, or a lack of lubrication. Symptoms of transmission failure include a complete loss of power, difficulty shifting gears, and a grinding noise from the transmission. Repairing transmission failure typically involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension Worn Struts:** The front suspension struts can become worn over time, leading to a bumpy ride and reduced handling. Symptoms include a bouncing or floating sensation when driving, uneven tire wear, and a knocking noise from the front of the vehicle. Repairing worn struts typically involves replacing the struts and alignment. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
* **Rear Suspension Worn Leaf Springs:** The rear suspension leaf springs can become worn or broken over time, leading to a sagging rear end and reduced handling. Symptoms include a sagging rear end, difficulty carrying heavy loads, and a rough ride. Repairing worn leaf springs typically involves replacing the leaf springs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Battery drain is a common issue on the 2006 Nissan Urvan. The battery can drain due to a variety of factors, including a faulty alternator, a parasitic drain, or a weak battery. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle, dim headlights, and a dead battery. Repairing battery drain typically involves diagnosing the source of the drain and replacing the faulty components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000
* **Alternator Failure:** Alternator failure is a potential issue on the 2006 Nissan Urvan. The alternator is responsible for charging the battery and powering the electrical system. Symptoms of alternator failure include a dead battery, dim headlights, and a warning light on the dashboard. Repairing alternator failure typically involves replacing the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** Rust is a common issue on the 2006 Nissan Urvan. The body panels and frame can be susceptible to rust, especially in areas with high humidity or salt exposure. Symptoms of rust include peeling paint, bubbling, and holes in the body panels. Repairing rust typically involves sanding, painting, or replacing the affected panels. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracks:** The dashboard can develop cracks over time, especially in areas exposed to sunlight. The cracks can be unsightly and may interfere with the operation of the dashboard controls. Repairing dashboard cracks typically involves replacing the dashboard or repairing the cracks with a dashboard repair kit. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system can malfunction on the 2006 Nissan Urvan. The system may not blow air, may blow air at the wrong temperature, or may not respond to commands from the user. Repairing climate control malfunctions typically involves diagnosing the source of the issue and replacing the faulty components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000

**Summary**

Overall, the 2006 Nissan Urvan is a reliable vehicle with a spacious interior and a comfortable ride. However, it is not without its issues. Common issues include oil leaks from the valve covers on the 3.5L V6 engine, timing chain failure, fuel injector failure on the 2.5L diesel engine, transmission slipping, suspension worn struts, battery drain, alternator failure, rust, dashboard cracks, and climate control malfunctions. The severity of these issues ranges from minor to major, and the cost to fix them can vary significantly.
