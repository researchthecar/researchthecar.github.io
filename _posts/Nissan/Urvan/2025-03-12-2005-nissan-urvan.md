The 2005 Nissan Urvan (also known as the Nissan Caravan in some markets) is a versatile commercial van appreciated for its cargo capacity, reliability, and practicality. Engine options for this model year include the 2.0L and 2.5L gasoline engines, as well as a 2.5L diesel engine. The 2.5L gasoline engine produces around 145 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque. Transmissions typically include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Urvan's spacious interior and dependability, but some dislike its basic features and somewhat dated styling.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE Gasoline Engine**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, particularly in higher mileage vehicles. This may present as the need to add oil more frequently between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: The causes can be varied, from worn valve stem seals to piston ring issues. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the root cause. Depending on the cause, repairs may range from replacing valve stem seals to a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L YD25DDTi Diesel Engine**
*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, rough idling, decreased power, and excessive black smoke from the exhaust. This can be caused by contaminated fuel or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves testing the fuel injectors. Replacement of faulty injectors is usually the recommended solution. In some cases, cleaning the injectors may temporarily alleviate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**
*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, hesitates when shifting, or shifts harshly. This can be accompanied by unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or burnt, a fluid and filter change may help. If the problem persists, it could indicate worn clutches or a faulty valve body, requiring a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter change) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn shock absorbers or struts is the recommended solution.
