### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Nissan Urvan generally presents as a durable commercial vehicle. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the diesel engines, particularly the turbocharger and glow plug systems on the 2.5L, and potential overheating or injector issues on the 3.0L. Transmission reliability is decent, with manual clutches being a wear item and automatics sometimes exhibiting harsh shifting. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear over time, especially under heavy use. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are not uncommon. Exterior and interior wear are typical for a vehicle of this age and purpose, with minor rust and upholstery wear being the most frequent complaints. Overall, the Urvan is a workhorse, but owners should be mindful of potential diesel engine maintenance and regular checks of suspension and electrical components.
