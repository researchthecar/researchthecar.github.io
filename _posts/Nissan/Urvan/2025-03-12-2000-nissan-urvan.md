**Summary**

The 2000 Nissan Urvan is a reliable commercial van, but owners should be aware of some common issues. Engine issues, particularly with the fuel injectors and glow plugs on the TD27 diesel, and distributor or IAC valve on the KA24E gasoline, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic transmission's slipping and harsh shifting, also pose a potential expense. Suspension wear and rust are common concerns. Electrical and interior issues also need attention. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but regular maintenance and prompt repairs can help extend the life of this practical van.
