The 2016 Nissan 370Z is a two-door sports car known for its sharp handling, potent V6 engine, and relatively affordable price point. It was available in several trims, including base, Sport, Sport Tech, Touring, and Nismo. All trims came equipped with the same 3.7-liter VQ37VHR V6 engine, producing 332 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque (Nismo models had slightly higher output). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed automatic. Owners often praise the 370Z for its engaging driving experience and classic sports car feel. Criticisms commonly include a dated interior, limited cargo space, and a somewhat harsh ride.
