The 2021 Nissan 370Z, the last of its generation, is a two-door sports car known for its raw driving experience and classic Z car styling. It comes equipped with a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 332 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque (or 350 horsepower and 276 lb-ft of torque in the Nismo variant). It offers a choice between a 6-speed manual transmission and a 7-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its engaging handling and powerful engine, the 370Z is sometimes criticized for its dated interior, limited technology features, and relatively firm ride.
