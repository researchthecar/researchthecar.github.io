The 2010 Nissan 370Z is a two-door sports car known for its sharp handling, potent engine, and distinctive styling. It came standard with a 3.7-liter VQ37VHR V6 engine producing 332 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. A higher performance NISMO edition was available with 350 horsepower and 276 lb-ft of torque.
