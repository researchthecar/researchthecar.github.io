The 2009 Nissan 370Z marked a significant evolution from its predecessor, the 350Z, offering a more refined and powerful driving experience. It came equipped with a 3.7-liter VQ37VHR V6 engine producing 332 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque (350 horsepower in the Nismo trim). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed automatic. Enthusiasts generally praised the 370Z for its responsive engine, sharp handling, and aggressive styling. Common complaints often revolved around the stiff ride, limited cargo space, and road noise.

**Summary**

The 2009 Nissan 370Z, while a fun and engaging sports car, is not without its potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the clutch slave cylinder in the manual transmission models, excessive oil consumption in some engines, and potential electrical problems like the steering lock malfunction. Suspension components like rear shocks and differential bushings can also wear out. The costs of repairs can vary widely, from relatively inexpensive sensor replacements to more substantial engine or transmission work. While not all 370Zs will experience these issues, prospective buyers should be aware of them and inspect the car carefully before purchase.
