## Engine

### 3.7L V6 (VQ37VHR)
**Oil Consumption**

- **Solution:** Regular oil level checks and top-offs. In some cases, internal engine modifications or component replacement may be necessary.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2,500+

**Variable Valve Event and Lift (VVEL) Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Check Engine Light illumination, rough idling, loss of power, and potential stalling.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the VVEL actuator and potentially related camshaft and timing components.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $3,000


## Transmission

### 7-Speed Automatic
**Hesitation/Jerking**
- **Symptoms:** Slight hesitation or jerky shifts during acceleration or downshifting, particularly at lower speeds.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid flush and refill, software update for the transmission control module, or internal transmission repairs.
- **Cost:** $300 - $1,500
