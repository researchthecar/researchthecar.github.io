The 2006 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck known for its ruggedness and reliability. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (only with the I4), a 6-speed manual (only with the V6), and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Frontier's capable off-road performance and comfortable ride. Some common complaints include premature timing chain wear on the V6 engine and rust issues, particularly in areas with road salt.

**Summary**

The 2006 Nissan Frontier has some common issues to be aware of. The most serious is frame rust, which can be very expensive to repair or even render the vehicle unsafe. The 4.0L V6 engine is prone to timing chain issues, which can also be costly. Other common issues include suspension component wear, electrical problems, and transmission issues. While some of these issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the frame for rust and be aware of the potential for timing chain and transmission problems, particularly on higher mileage vehicles.
