The 2001 Nissan Frontier is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. It offers several engine and transmission options. The most common engine is the 3.3L VG33E V6, producing around 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 2.4L KA24DE inline-4, which provides around 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices typically consist of a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Frontier's simple design, affordability, and ruggedness. Common complaints include a somewhat dated interior, limited rear seat space (especially in the standard cab), and fuel economy that is not the best in its class.

**Summary:**

The 2001 Nissan Frontier, while generally reliable, exhibits several common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the knock sensor on the V6 and timing chain tensioner on the inline-4, can be costly to address. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission work or frame rust repair, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle for these issues before purchase.
