The 2013 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and affordability. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 generating 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual (only with the 2.5L), a 6-speed manual (only with the 4.0L), and a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate its simple design, capable off-road performance (especially with the PRO-4X trim), and ease of maintenance. Common dislikes include its outdated interior, lower fuel economy compared to newer trucks, and relatively basic features on lower trims.

**Summary**

The 2013 Nissan Frontier has some known issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most serious concern is the potential for "SMOD" with the automatic transmission, which can lead to very costly repairs. Timing chain issues on both engines are also a notable concern. Suspension issues like leaf spring and ball joint failures are common for a truck of this age and use. Electrical problems stemming from the IPDM can be frustrating. While the Frontier is generally reliable, addressing these potential issues proactively can help prevent more significant problems down the road. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate inconvenience to significant expense, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the problem and the extent of the damage.
