The 2002 Nissan Frontier is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and affordability. It was offered with several engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 engine producing 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Frontier's simple design, off-road capability (especially with the 4x4 models), and overall durability. Common complaints include a somewhat dated interior and relatively poor fuel economy compared to newer trucks.

Engine issues, such as timing belt replacement (V6) and distributor failures (I4), are important to address. Suspension components like idler arms and ball joints are prone to wear and can affect steering. Transmission issues are less common but can be expensive to repair.

Severity of the issues range from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing several thousand dollars.
