The 2024 Nissan Frontier represents the third generation of the mid-size pickup truck, offering a blend of rugged capability and modern features. All 2024 Frontier models are equipped with a 3.8-liter V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission. While owners often praise the Frontier's robust engine, updated interior, and off-road capabilities, some common complaints include concerns about fuel economy, ride quality on rough roads, and some reported electronic glitches.
