The 2014 Nissan Frontier is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 generating 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmissions available are a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual (V6 only), and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Frontier's simple design, affordability, and ruggedness. Common dislikes include its dated interior, fuel economy, and smaller rear seat space in the King Cab configuration.

**Electrical**

*   **IPDM (Intelligent Power Distribution Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting issues, fuel pump not engaging, or other electrical malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replace the IPDM.

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan Frontier is generally a reliable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as timing chain tensioner failure (both engines), "SMOD" in automatic transmission models, leaf spring sagging, and IPDM failure. Frame rust is also a concern, especially in northern climates. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some repairs being relatively inexpensive while others, like transmission replacement or frame repair, can be quite costly.
