The 2007 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capabilities. Available engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 and a 4.0L V6. The 4.0L V6 produces 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, and a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate its ruggedness and practical size, while common complaints include a somewhat dated interior and potential for rust.

**Engine**

**4.0L VQ40DE V6**

*   **Timing Chain Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, especially on cold starts, indicates wear in the timing chain and/or tensioners. This can eventually lead to engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and possibly related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Sending Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate fuel gauge readings or complete failure of the fuel gauge.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel sending unit within the fuel tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L QR25DE Inline-4**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency. Reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **"SMOD" (Strawberry Milkshake of Death)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks into the transmission fluid due to a failure of the radiator's internal transmission cooler. This results in a pink, milky fluid that destroys the transmission. Overheating, slipping, and complete transmission failure can occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the radiator and potentially the entire transmission, depending on the extent of the damage. A transmission flush may also be needed if the damage is minor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether transmission replacement is necessary).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, especially when loaded. Broken or cracked leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, excessive play in the front wheels, and potential for complete ball joint separation, leading to loss of control.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lower ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **IPDM (Intelligent Power Distribution Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting issues, stalling, electrical components not functioning correctly (lights, wipers, etc.).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IPDM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine Stalling, rough running, or failure to start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust on the vehicle's frame, particularly in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure. Can compromise structural integrity.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, frame reinforcement, or, in severe cases, frame replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity of the rust).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Clockspring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag warning light illuminated, horn not functioning, and potential issues with steering wheel controls.

**Summary**

The 2007 Nissan Frontier, while generally reliable, has a few common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The "SMOD" issue with the automatic transmission can be extremely costly to repair, and frame rust is a major concern in certain regions. Timing chain issues on the V6 and catalytic converter issues on the Inline-4, along with suspension and electrical problems, represent moderate repair costs. Overall, a pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended, especially checking the radiator, frame, and suspension components.
