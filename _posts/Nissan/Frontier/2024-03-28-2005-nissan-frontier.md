**Introduction**

The 2005 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck available in a variety of configurations, including King Cab and Crew Cab body styles, and rear-wheel or four-wheel drive. It is powered by a 4.0-liter V6 engine that produces 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. The Frontier is known for its ruggedness, off-road capabilities, and spacious interior, but has received criticism for its dated interior and lack of advanced safety features.
