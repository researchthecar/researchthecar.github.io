The 2012 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability, affordability, and off-road capability. It offers two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 and a 4.0L V6. The 2.5L produces 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque. The 4.0L V6 generates 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual (2.5L), a 6-speed manual (4.0L), and a 5-speed automatic (both engines). Owners appreciate the Frontier's simple design, strong V6 engine, and capable 4x4 system. Common dislikes include the dated interior, lower fuel economy compared to competitors, and limited rear seat space in the King Cab configuration.
