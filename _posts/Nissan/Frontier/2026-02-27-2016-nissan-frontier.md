### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Nissan Frontier generally exhibits good mechanical reliability, with its powertrain components (engine and transmission) showing few widespread issues. The primary concerns tend to be related to the electrical system, specifically battery drain and alternator failures, which can be costly to repair. Exterior issues like frame rust, especially in rust-belt regions, and a potentially fragile tailgate handle are also noted.
