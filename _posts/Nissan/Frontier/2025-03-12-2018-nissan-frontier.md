The 2018 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and affordability, though it lags behind competitors in terms of features and refinement. The 2018 Frontier came standard with a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine producing 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque. An optional 4.0-liter V6 engine was also available, generating 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual (only with the I4), a 6-speed manual (V6 only), and a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate its simple design, capable V6 engine, and lower price point. Common complaints include outdated styling, poor fuel economy, and a basic interior.

**Summary**

The 2018 Nissan Frontier presents a mixed bag in terms of common issues. While the 2.5L engine shows to be mostly problem-free, the 4.0L V6 can experience timing chain issues that can be costly to repair. The 5-speed automatic transmission can have fluid leaks that, if left unattended, can lead to additional problems. Suspension issues, particularly leaf spring sagging, are also common. Electrical gremlins with the blower motor resistor and ABS sensors also pop up from time to time. Frame rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winter conditions, and can lead to expensive repairs if left unaddressed. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from moderate to potentially severe, with repair costs varying accordingly. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
