**Introduction to the 2001 Nissan Frontier**

The 2001 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck available with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-four and a 3.3-liter V6. The 2.4-liter engine produces 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.3-liter V6 generates 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a five-speed manual and a four-speed automatic. The four-wheel drive system on the Frontier uses an electronic shift-on-the-fly system and a limited-slip rear differential. The Frontier received praise for its off-road capabilities, affordable price, and rugged design, but criticism for its poor fuel economy and cramped interior.
