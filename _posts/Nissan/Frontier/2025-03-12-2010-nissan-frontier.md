The 2010 Nissan Frontier is a popular mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capabilities. It comes with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 and a 4.0L V6. The 2.5L produces around 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, while the 4.0L V6 generates approximately 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual (V6 only), and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Frontier's simple, rugged design and its suitability for both daily driving and work. Common criticisms include its somewhat dated interior and fuel economy.

**Summary**

The 2010 Nissan Frontier, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. The potential for timing chain issues on both engines and the radiator/transmission "SMOD" issue are serious concerns that can lead to costly repairs. The IPDM failure is also common. Rust, especially on the frame and suspension components, is another point to inspect carefully. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor electrical problems to major engine and transmission failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. Inspecting these areas thoroughly before purchasing a used 2010 Frontier is highly recommended.
