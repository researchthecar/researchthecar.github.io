The 2006 Nissan Frontier is a compact pickup truck with four engine options: a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder with 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, a 3.3-liter V6 with 180 horsepower and 198 lb-ft of torque, a 4.0-liter V6 with 265 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0-liter V6 with a supercharger, producing 310 horsepower and 341 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic, and a 5-speed automatic.
