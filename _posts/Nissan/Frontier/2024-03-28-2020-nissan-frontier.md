**Introduction:**

The 2020 Nissan Frontier is a midsize pickup truck offered with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 and a 3.8L V6. The base engine produces 152 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, while the V6 generates 310 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. The Frontier comes standard with a 5-speed manual transmission, but a 9-speed automatic transmission is available as an option. Despite its aging platform, the Frontier remains popular for its ruggedness, reliability, and affordability. However, it falls short in terms of fuel efficiency, interior refinement, and modern technology compared to its competitors.
