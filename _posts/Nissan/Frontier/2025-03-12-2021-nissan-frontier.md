The 2021 Nissan Frontier represents the last model year of the second-generation Frontier before a major redesign. All 2021 Frontiers came standard with a 3.8-liter V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the improved power and updated infotainment system compared to previous years of the second generation, but disliked the carry-over interior design and dated overall feel of the truck.

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature failure of the timing chain tensioner, leading to excessive timing chain noise, rough running, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include rattling or ticking noises from the engine, especially on startup or when accelerating. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.

**Summary**

The 2021 Nissan Frontier, while benefiting from a new powertrain, still exhibits some common issues. Engine issues like timing chain tensioner and valve cover gasket leaks can be relatively costly. Transmission problems such as harsh shifting and torque converter issues may also arise. Suspension noise is a common annoyance, while electrical glitches with the infotainment system and backup camera can affect usability. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of them and factor in potential repair costs. Overall, the issues are generally moderate in severity, with potential repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission repairs.
