The 2017 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and affordability. It typically comes with two engine options: a 2.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a more popular 4.0-liter V6 engine producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual (only with the 2.5L engine), a 6-speed manual (only with the 4.0L engine), and a 5-speed automatic (available with both engines). Owners often appreciate the Frontier's simple design, off-road capability (especially in the Pro-4X trim), and lower price point compared to competitors. Common dislikes include its outdated interior, lower fuel economy compared to newer trucks, and relatively small rear seat in the King Cab configuration.

**Summary**

The 2017 Nissan Frontier, while generally reliable, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The 4.0L V6 engine is prone to timing chain and catalytic converter issues, which can be costly to repair. Transmission fluid leaks are also common. Suspension issues like leaf spring sagging/cracking and front strut mount failure can affect ride quality and handling. Electrical issues, particularly with the blower motor resistor and IPDM, can cause various problems. Frame rust is a concern, especially in regions with road salt. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but being aware of them can help buyers make informed decisions and potentially negotiate a better price or budget for future repairs.
