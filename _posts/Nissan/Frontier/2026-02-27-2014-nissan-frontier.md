### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Nissan Frontier demonstrates solid reliability overall, with the 2.5L engine and both transmission options showing no significant widespread issues. The primary concern for models equipped with the 4.0L V6 is potential timing chain wear, which can manifest as engine noise and requires a notable repair cost. Manual transmission models may eventually require clutch replacement due to normal wear. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are generally robust. Prospective buyers should be aware of the potential timing chain issue on V6 models and consider the maintenance history of any used Frontier.
