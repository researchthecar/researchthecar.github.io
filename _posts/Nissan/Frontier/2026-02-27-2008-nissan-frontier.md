### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Nissan Frontier is a generally robust truck, with its V6 engine being a popular choice for its power. However, owners should be aware of potential oil consumption and timing chain noise issues with the 4-cylinder engine, and crankshaft sensor failures or intake manifold leaks with the V6. The automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and instrument clusters are not uncommon. Exterior paint issues, specifically clear coat peeling, can also occur. Despite these points, with proper maintenance and attention to these known issues, the 2008 Frontier can remain a reliable workhorse.
