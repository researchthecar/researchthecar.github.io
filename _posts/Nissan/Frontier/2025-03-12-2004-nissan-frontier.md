The 2004 Nissan Frontier is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-four cylinder engine producing 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 engine producing 180 horsepower and 202 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Frontier's simplicity, ruggedness, and affordability. Common dislikes include its dated interior and relatively low fuel economy compared to newer trucks.

**Summary**

The 2004 Nissan Frontier, while generally reliable, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly distributor failure in the V6 and timing chain issues in the inline-four, can be costly. Suspension components like ball joints and idler arms are prone to wear and can impact safety. Electrical gremlins such as instrument cluster problems and blower motor resistor failures are also relatively common. Rust is also a concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Overall, while these issues can range in severity and cost, careful inspection and preventative maintenance can help mitigate potential problems.
