**Introduction to the 2019 Nissan Frontier**

The 2019 Nissan Frontier is a midsize pickup truck that offers a choice between two engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with 152 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0-liter V6 engine with 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. The Frontier is available in four trim levels: S, SV, SL, and Pro-4X.

Owners of the 2019 Nissan Frontier often praise its ruggedness, off-road capabilities, and affordability. However, it has also received some criticism for its dated interior, lack of modern technology, and poor fuel economy.
