The 2023 Nissan Frontier represents the second year of the truck's third generation, offering a blend of rugged capability and modern features. It comes standard with a 3.8-liter V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often praise its comfortable ride, strong engine performance, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some common criticisms include fuel economy that lags behind competitors, and some find the interior design to be somewhat basic.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine misfires, particularly during cold starts or under heavy acceleration. This can manifest as rough idling, hesitation, and a noticeable decrease in power. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to misfires on specific cylinders (e.g., P0301, P0302) may be present.
    *   Solution: The root cause can vary from faulty spark plugs or ignition coils to fuel injector issues or even a vacuum leak. A thorough diagnostic process is necessary to pinpoint the exact cause. Replacement of the affected components, such as spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors, is the usual remedy.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+ depending on the specific cause and extent of the repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Knocking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported an engine knocking noise. This may be more apparent during cold starts.
    *   Solution: The root cause can vary. It may be necessary to have the vehicle professionally diagnosed by a certified mechanic.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the specific cause and extent of the repairs.

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted harsh or jerky shifting between certain gears, particularly at lower speeds. This can be felt as a noticeable "clunk" or "jolt" during gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some instances, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can address the issue. In other cases, further inspection of the transmission is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the specific solution needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission will slip during acceleration, meaning the engine RPMs rise without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: The root cause can vary. It may be necessary to have the vehicle professionally diagnosed by a certified mechanic.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the specific cause and extent of the repairs.

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable squeaking noise emanating from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Applying grease to the leaf spring bushings can temporarily alleviate the noise. For a more permanent solution, replacing the bushings or the entire leaf spring assembly might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes altogether. This can disrupt navigation, audio playback, and other functions.
    *   Solution: A software update might resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a replacement of the infotainment unit might be necessary.

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling noises coming from the dashboard, especially when driving on rough roads.
