### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Nissan Cube demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its powertrain. The 1.8L engine is generally robust. The primary area of concern is the CVT transmission, which can occasionally exhibit issues like hesitation or shuddering, potentially requiring fluid services or, in rarer cases, replacement. Suspension components, such as struts and ball joints, may show wear typical for a vehicle of this age and mileage, leading to noises or handling degradation. Minor electrical issues, like faulty window regulators or infotainment glitches, are also noted but are not pervasive. Exterior and interior components are largely free of widespread problems. For prospective buyers, a pre-purchase inspection focusing on the transmission and suspension is recommended.
