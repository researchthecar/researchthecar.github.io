**Introduction**

The 2014 Nissan Cube is a compact, box-shaped hatchback that offers a unique and spacious interior. It is available with two engine options: a 1.8-liter inline-four with 122 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5-liter inline-four with 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. The 1.8-liter engine comes paired with either a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or a five-speed manual transmission, while the 1.5-liter engine is mated to a CVT.

The Cube has been praised for its roomy interior, tall driving position, and versatile seating arrangements. However, it has also been criticized for its underpowered engines, poor handling, and lack of features.
