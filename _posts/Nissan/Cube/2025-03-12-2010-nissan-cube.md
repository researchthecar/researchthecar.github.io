The 2010 Nissan Cube is a quirky and uniquely styled subcompact car known for its boxy shape and spacious interior. It came equipped with a 1.8-liter inline-4 engine producing 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Many people appreciated the Cube for its distinctive design, comfortable ride, and good fuel economy. However, some disliked its polarizing looks and perceived lack of performance compared to other vehicles.

**Engine**

**1.8L I4 (MR18DE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs. Symptoms include low oil levels, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings may address the issue. In more severe cases, the engine may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported engine misfires, resulting in rough idling, reduced power, and illuminated check engine light. This can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause of the misfire and replace the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is known to be problematic and is prone to failure. Common symptoms include hesitation, slipping, shuddering, and complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT unit is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining noise emanating from the transmission, especially during acceleration or deceleration. This indicates internal wear and potential CVT failure.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid change might temporarily alleviate the noise, but eventually, a CVT replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (fluid change), $3,000 - $5,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Axle Beam Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with the rear axle beam bending and causing alignment problems. This can be caused by corrosion or impact damage. Symptoms can include a noticeable lean in the vehicle, uneven tire wear, and difficulty maintaining alignment.
    * Solution: Replacement of the entire rear axle beam assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor resistor controls the fan speed for the heating and air conditioning system. Failure of this resistor results in the fan only working on one speed (usually high) or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Switch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate correctly, often attributed to faulty window switches.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected power window switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Door Latch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported problems with the rear door latch mechanism, making it difficult to open or close the rear door properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear door latch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks developing on the dashboard surface, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is the only permanent solution, but is often cost-prohibitive. Dashboard covers are a common workaround.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (dashboard cover) - $1,000+ (dashboard replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Nissan Cube, while stylish, is prone to several issues, most notably related to the CVT transmission, which can be costly to repair or replace. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and misfires are also potential concerns. Electrical problems, such as blower motor resistor failures and power window switch issues, are relatively minor, but can still be inconvenient. Suspension issues, such as the rear axle beam bending, can also be costly to repair. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with potential repair costs varying significantly. It is recommended to get a pre-purchase inspection.
