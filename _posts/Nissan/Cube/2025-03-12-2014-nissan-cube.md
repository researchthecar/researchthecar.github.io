The 2014 Nissan Cube is a quirky and uniquely styled compact car known for its spacious interior and distinctive boxy shape. It is powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Cube's comfortable ride and ample cargo space. Some common criticisms include the polarizing exterior design and relatively slow acceleration.

**Engine**

**1.8L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights, bluish exhaust smoke, and the need to add oil more often than expected.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any leaks is crucial. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic may need to perform a compression test and leak-down test to determine the cause and if piston rings or valve seals need replacing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter can fail prematurely, leading to poor engine performance, reduced fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is a known weak point in many Nissan vehicles. Symptoms include shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, hesitation, whining noises, and eventual complete failure.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change can temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but ultimately, CVT replacement or rebuild is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ for replacement; $2,000 - $4,000 for rebuild
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Axle Beam Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with rust and corrosion on the rear axle beam. In extreme cases, this can lead to weakening of the beam and potential safety concerns.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the rear axle beam for rust and corrosion is recommended. If significant corrosion is present, replacement of the axle beam is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially when the vehicle is not driven for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Testing the battery and charging system is recommended to identify any faults. Parasitic draw tests can also be performed to pinpoint the source of the drain. Replacement of a faulty battery or repair of the charging system may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement; $200 - $800+ for charging system repair
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate, often due to a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Door Latch Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the rear door latch mechanism, making it difficult to open or close the rear door properly.
    *   Solution: Adjustment or replacement of the rear door latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature cracking of the dashboard material, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$1,500+ for replacement; $50 - $200 for a cover
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan Cube, while offering a unique aesthetic and a spacious interior, can present owners with several potential issues. The most concerning are the CVT transmission problems, which can be costly to repair. Other common issues include excessive oil consumption, rear axle beam issues, and electrical problems. Addressing these problems proactively and maintaining the vehicle properly can help to mitigate some of these risks, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential expenses. The severity of the issues ranges from relatively minor (battery drain, power window failure) to more serious and expensive (CVT failure, excessive oil consumption).
