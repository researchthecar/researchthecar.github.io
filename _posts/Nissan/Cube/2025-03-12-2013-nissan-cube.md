The 2013 Nissan Cube is a quirky and distinctive compact car known for its boxy design and surprisingly spacious interior. Powered by a 1.8-liter inline-4 engine producing 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque, it was offered with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Cube's unique styling, good fuel economy, and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include its unconventional appearance (which is polarizing), and some perceived lack of power.

**Engine**

**1.8L Inline-4 (Engine Code MR18DE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust (in severe cases), and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels frequently and addressing any leaks promptly is important. For more severe cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail prematurely, leading to a check engine light (typically P0420 code) and potentially reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the CVT transmission, including shuddering, jerking, slipping, and complete failure. These problems can manifest as hesitation during acceleration, erratic shifting, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change may temporarily alleviate the symptoms. However, if the problem persists or worsens, a CVT replacement or rebuild is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Axle Bearing Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or howling noise coming from the rear of the vehicle, especially noticeable at higher speeds. This indicates worn rear axle bearings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear axle bearings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor resistor controls the fan speed for the climate control system. If it fails, the fan may only work on one speed (usually high) or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door lock actuator may fail, preventing the door from locking or unlocking electronically.
    *   Solution: Replacing the door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on the Hatch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is more likely to appear at the top of the hatch above the glass, and around the rear license plate.
    *   Solution: Sanding and painting the rusted areas or replacing the panel in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors can become loose and sag or the plastic hinge mechanism can break, rendering them unusable.
    *   Solution: Replacing the sun visor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Nissan Cube has some notable issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most concerning is the potential for CVT transmission problems, which can be expensive to repair. Oil consumption in the engine is another potential issue. Other problems like blower motor resistor and door lock actuator failures, and sun visor sagging are less severe but can still be irritating. Overall, while the Cube offers a unique driving experience, it's essential to carefully inspect any used model for these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
