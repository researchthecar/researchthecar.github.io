**Introduction**

The 2012 Nissan Cube is a subcompact hatchback known for its boxy design and spacious interior. It offers three trim levels: S, SV, and SL, with a single engine and transmission option. The 1.8-liter, 4-cylinder engine produces 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While praised for its unique styling and practicality, the Cube has received criticism for its lackluster performance and fuel economy.
