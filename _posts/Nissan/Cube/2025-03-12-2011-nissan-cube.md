The 2011 Nissan Cube is a quirky and polarizing subcompact car known for its asymmetrical design and spacious interior. The sole engine option for this year is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally liked the Cube's unique styling, roomy cabin, and good fuel economy. Criticisms often focused on its unconventional looks, limited rear visibility, and relatively slow acceleration.
