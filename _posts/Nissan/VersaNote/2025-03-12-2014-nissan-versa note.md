The 2014 Nissan Versa Note is a subcompact hatchback known for its spacious interior and excellent fuel economy. It comes with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission (very rare) or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate the Versa Note's affordability and roomy backseat, but some dislike its slow acceleration and basic interior.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and potential engine damage if the oil level drops too low.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and top off as needed. In severe cases, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (engine replacement)

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail prematurely, leading to a check engine light with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency. This can also cause reduced engine performance and failed emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint is premature CVT failure or malfunction. Symptoms include slipping, hesitation, jerking during acceleration, and a whining noise from the transmission. The "check engine" light or "TCM" (Transmission Control Module) light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: In many cases, the CVT needs to be replaced. Fluid changes may help in the short term, but often do not resolve the underlying issue. Replacing the valve body may help in some cases, but CVT replacement is most common.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls:
        *   Recall Number: 16V912000
        *   Recall Number: 16V245000

*   **CVT Juddering or Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience juddering or shuddering, particularly at low speeds or during acceleration. This can be caused by degradation of the CVT fluid or internal wear.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change using genuine Nissan CVT fluid (NS-3) may help alleviate the issue in some cases. However, if the problem persists, CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (fluid change), $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear shock absorbers may leak fluid or fail prematurely, resulting in a bouncy ride and reduced handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (both shocks)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the battery draining overnight or within a few days of being parked. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or accessory.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various electrical components and circuits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Airbag Sensor/Wiring**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag warning light illuminates due to a faulty sensor or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of the airbag sensor or wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the specific issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Loose or Broken Trim Pieces**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exterior trim pieces, such as side skirts or bumper covers, may become loose or break, especially on models that have been exposed to harsh weather conditions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the trim piece)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks may become erratic or fail to operate properly, either failing to lock or unlock.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (per door)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2014 Nissan Versa Note is a budget-friendly car, but it's plagued with some potentially expensive issues, especially regarding the CVT transmission. CVT failures are a common and costly repair. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption, can also lead to significant expenses. While other issues like electrical problems and suspension wear are less severe, they contribute to the overall ownership experience. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. A thorough inspection, including a CVT test drive, is highly recommended.
