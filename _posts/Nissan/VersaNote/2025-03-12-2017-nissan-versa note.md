The 2017 Nissan Versa Note is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and spacious interior for its class. It comes standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate its fuel efficiency and ease of parking, while others find the acceleration and overall driving experience lacking. Common complaints include the performance of the CVT transmission and the relatively basic interior features.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, engine knocking, or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: There is not a known solution, though a compression test may be recommended to check engine health.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:

* **Engine Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration, knocking noises from the engine bay.
    * Solution: Replacement of the engine mount(s).

    *   Solution: Replacement of the struts/shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (per pair)

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle battery dies prematurely, often requiring frequent jump starts or replacement. Diagnosing parasitic draw is needed to find the culprit.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the excessive battery drain (e.g., faulty sensor, improperly closing trunk light, failing body control module) and repair or replace the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
