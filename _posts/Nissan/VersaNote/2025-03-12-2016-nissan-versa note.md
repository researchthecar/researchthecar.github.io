The 2016 Nissan Versa Note is a subcompact hatchback known for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency. It comes equipped with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate its affordability and practicality, while others find the engine underpowered and the interior materials basic.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil warning light or noticeable oil loss on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and potentially switching to a higher viscosity oil. In more severe cases, engine repairs or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+ depending on the severity of the issue
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased engine power, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation upon acceleration, slipping, jerky movements, unusual noises (whining or buzzing), and the transmission warning light illuminating. Some owners have reported complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update may resolve the issue. However, in many cases, transmission replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ for replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Juddering or Shaking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable vibration or shaking felt during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid change can sometimes alleviate the issue. However, it could also indicate internal wear requiring more extensive repairs or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150+ for fluid change, $3,000 - $5,000+ for replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll when cornering, uneven tire wear, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts/shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car failing to start, especially after sitting for a short period. May be related to a parasitic draw.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and eliminating the source of the parasitic draw. This could involve replacing a faulty component or addressing wiring issues. Replacing the battery may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, rough idling, stalling, decreased fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues (Especially in areas with road salt)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on body panels, especially around wheel wells, door edges, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, which may involve sanding, patching, and repainting affected areas. Rustproofing treatments can help prevent future rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blowing warm air or not functioning at all. Common causes include a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the faulty component. This could involve recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, or replacing the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
