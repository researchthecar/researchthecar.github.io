The 2004 Nissan Almera is a compact car known for its practicality and fuel efficiency. Available engine options included a 1.5-liter gasoline engine producing approximately 98 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque, a 1.8-liter gasoline engine producing approximately 114 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.2-liter diesel engine (not commonly available in all markets). Transmission options were typically a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Almera for its reliability and affordability. However, common complaints revolve around the vehicle's relatively basic interior, and some reported issues with specific components as it ages.

**Engine**

**1.5L Gasoline Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust or a noticeable drop in the oil level on the dipstick.
    * Solution: In some cases, switching to a higher viscosity oil can help mitigate the issue. If the consumption is severe, engine rebuilding, including piston ring replacement, might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coil Pack Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light indicating a cylinder misfire (e.g., P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304).
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per coil, plus labor
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.8L Gasoline Engine**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. This can indicate a worn or failing timing chain tensioner, potentially leading to timing chain failure and severe engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner, and potentially the timing chain and guides as well.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic idling, stalling, or difficulty starting. The IAC valve regulates airflow to maintain a stable idle speed.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacing the IAC valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.2L Diesel Engine**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Slipping Gears**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed or rough gear changes, or the transmission slipping out of gear. This can be caused by worn clutches, low transmission fluid, or valve body issues.
    * Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, more extensive repairs, such as valve body refurbishment or transmission rebuild, may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250 for fluid/filter change, $500 - $2500+ for rebuild
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling and stability.
    * Solution: Replacing worn suspension bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per corner
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Wheel Bearings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Humming or grinding noise from the wheels, which increases with speed. Play in the wheel when checking for looseness.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected wheel bearing(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per wheel
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard (e.g., battery light), difficulty starting, or a completely dead battery.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Doors not locking or unlocking properly with the remote or key.
    * Solution: Replacing the door lock actuator or repairing wiring issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible rust on the undercarriage, especially in areas exposed to salt or moisture.
    * Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, priming, and painting. In severe cases, welding may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+, depending on severity
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Nissan Almera, while generally reliable, is prone to certain issues due to its age. Engine issues like oil consumption and timing chain tensioner problems can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, while less frequent, can also be expensive. Suspension and electrical issues are more common and generally less costly to address. Rust on the undercarriage is a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common issues and budget for potential repairs.
