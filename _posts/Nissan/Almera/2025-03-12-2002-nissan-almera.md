The 2002 Nissan Almera is a compact car known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. Available engine options included the 1.5L petrol engine (QG15DE), 1.8L petrol engine (QG18DE) and the 2.2L diesel engine (YD22DDT/YD22DDTi). The 1.5L engine produced approximately 90 horsepower and 93 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Almera for its practicality, ease of driving, and affordable running costs. Common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling and occasionally lackluster performance, particularly with the smaller engine options.

**Engine**

**1.5L Petrol (QG15DE)**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**

    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and using a higher-viscosity oil might mitigate the issue. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Causes the engine to stall or fail to start.
    *   Solution: Replace the Crankshaft Position Sensor
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.8L Petrol (QG18DE)**
*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or become noisy over time, potentially leading to engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Throttle Body Issues**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision and increased tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Failed Shock Absorbers/Struts**

**Summary**

The 2002 Nissan Almera, while generally reliable, does exhibit some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the timing chain on the 1.8L petrol engine and oil consumption on the 1.5L petrol engine, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, primarily with the automatic, can also be significant expenses. Suspension and electrical problems are fairly typical for a car of this age and mileage. Rust is a concern in some regions. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the car for these issues and factor in potential repair costs.
