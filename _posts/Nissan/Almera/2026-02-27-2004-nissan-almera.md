### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Nissan Almera generally presents as a reasonably reliable vehicle, particularly with its petrol engines and manual transmissions. The 2.2L JTD diesel engine, while offering good economy, has shown a propensity for turbocharger and injector issues, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions may experience slipping over time. Common non-powertrain issues include suspension bushing wear, electrical faults like window regulators and alternators, and the potential for rust, especially in adverse climates. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor can also fail. Overall, the Almera is a practical choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific reliability points, especially when considering the diesel variants or higher mileage examples.
