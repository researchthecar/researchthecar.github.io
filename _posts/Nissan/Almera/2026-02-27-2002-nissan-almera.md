### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Nissan Almera is generally considered a dependable compact car, especially with its petrol engine options. The diesel variants, particularly the 2.2L, are more prone to specific issues like turbocharger and injector problems, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, both manual and automatic, are typically related to wear and tear on components like the clutch or solenoids. Suspension components such as control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear out over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical issues like alternator failure and window regulator problems are not uncommon for a vehicle of this age. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Interior issues are generally minor, focusing on HVAC and trim rattles. Overall, the Almera offers reasonable reliability, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific weaknesses associated with the diesel engine and older components.
