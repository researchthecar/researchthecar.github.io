**Introduction**

The 2003 Nissan Almera, also known as the Sunny in some markets, is a compact sedan offered with several engine and transmission options. The 1.8-liter inline-four engine produces 118 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. A 2.0-liter inline-four engine is also available, producing 145 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Almera is praised for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and spacious interior, but criticized for its lackluster performance and outdated interior design.
