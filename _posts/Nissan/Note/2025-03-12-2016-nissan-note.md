The 2016 Nissan Note is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and surprisingly spacious interior for its size. It was available with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praised the Note for its gas mileage and maneuverability, while some common complaints include the CVT's performance and limited cargo space with the rear seats up.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels frequently and addressing any leaks is crucial. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic should inspect the engine for worn piston rings or valve seals. In severe cases, engine repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5000+ depending on the repair

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Jatco CVT used in the 2016 Note is prone to issues. Symptoms include shuddering, hesitation during acceleration, slipping, whining noises, and eventually complete transmission failure. Diagnostic codes may indicate issues with the valve body, belt, or other internal components.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic scan is necessary to pinpoint the issue. Some minor issues can be resolved with a CVT fluid flush. More severe problems often require valve body replacement or a complete CVT rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5000+ depending on repair or replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing premature battery drain, particularly when the vehicle is left sitting for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested for its charge holding ability, and have the charging system tested for proper operation. Check for parasitic draws using an ammeter. A faulty sensor, relay, or aftermarket device can also cause battery drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of the A/C system blowing warm air or failing to cool effectively are relatively common. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: A professional A/C system diagnosis is necessary. The system should be checked for leaks, and the compressor should be inspected for proper operation. A blend door actuator can be replaced, or a refrigerant leak can be repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+ depending on the issue

**Summary**

The 2016 Nissan Note, while praised for its fuel efficiency and practicality, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant and costly potential problem is CVT failure. Electrical issues and A/C problems are less costly but can be frustrating. Addressing oil consumption issues early can prevent major engine damage. Overall, while the Note can be a good value, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and have it checked by a trusted mechanic, especially the CVT, before purchasing.
