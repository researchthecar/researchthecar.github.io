**Introduction to the 2014 Nissan Note:**

The 2014 Nissan Note is a subcompact hatchback available with two engine options: a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter supercharged four-cylinder engine rated at 131 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

The Note is praised for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and user-friendly features. However, it has received some criticism for its lackluster performance and bland exterior styling.
