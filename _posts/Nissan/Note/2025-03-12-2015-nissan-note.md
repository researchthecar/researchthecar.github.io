The 2015 Nissan Note is a subcompact hatchback known for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency. The 2015 model year features a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise its affordability, good gas mileage, and cargo space for its size. Common complaints include the CVT transmission's performance and lack of power, especially when accelerating, as well as the basic interior features.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil, the oil light coming on between services, and in severe cases, visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is recommended. In severe cases, a mechanic may perform an oil consumption test to determine the extent of the issue. Depending on the test results, repairs might involve replacing valve seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the severity and necessary repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Nissan Note, while appreciated for its affordability and fuel efficiency, has some notable issues, particularly with its CVT transmission. CVT problems can be expensive to fix, and issues related to oil consumption and electrical components may add to the cost of ownership. Suspension issues are also common. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, transmission and engine repairs can become quite costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and be aware of these potential problems.
