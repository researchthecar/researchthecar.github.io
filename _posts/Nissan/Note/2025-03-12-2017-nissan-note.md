The 2017 Nissan Note is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior for its class. It offers a single engine option: a 1.6-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Note's gas mileage and maneuverability, but some criticize its lackluster acceleration and basic interior features.

**Engine**

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminates, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and hesitation upon acceleration. Could be due to faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    * Solution: Diagnose the cause of the misfire (using an OBDII scanner) and replace the faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause and number of parts needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, decreased engine performance, rattling noise from underneath the car, failed emissions test.
    * Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Failure/Shuddering**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds; hesitation; slipping sensation; or complete failure of the transmission with the vehicle unable to move.
    * Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change and reprogramming of the TCU (Transmission Control Unit) might help. In other cases, a complete CVT replacement is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change and reprogramming: $200-$400. CVT replacement: $3000 - $5000+

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Car won't start, frequent jump starts required.
    * Solution: Test the battery and charging system. If the battery is faulty, replace it. If there is a parasitic draw, identify and fix the source.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement: $100 - $300. Parasitic draw diagnosis and repair: $100 - $500+

**Summary**

The 2017 Nissan Note has some potential problem areas. The most significant concern appears to be the CVT transmission, which can suffer from shuddering, slipping, or complete failure, leading to expensive repairs or replacements. Other issues like engine misfires, catalytic converter failure, battery drains, and electrical problems, while less critical, can still add to the overall cost of ownership. The severity of these issues varies, but the potential for a costly CVT repair is a notable factor to consider when evaluating this vehicle.
