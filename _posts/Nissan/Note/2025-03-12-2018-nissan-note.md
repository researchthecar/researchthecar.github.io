The 2018 Nissan Note is a subcompact hatchback known for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency, and affordability. In the US market, it was offered with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Note's practicality, comfortable ride, and good gas mileage. However, some criticisms include a somewhat unrefined engine and transmission, as well as a basic interior.

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Juddering/Shaking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT can exhibit juddering or shaking, particularly during acceleration from a stop or at low speeds. This may feel like the transmission is slipping or hesitating.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change can resolve the issue. However, if the problem persists, it may indicate internal damage to the CVT, requiring a full replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 (fluid change); $3,000 - $5,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2018 Nissan Note owners have reported premature failure of the CVT, often at relatively low mileage. Symptoms can include loud whining noises, inability to accelerate, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT is the only reliable solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rear shock absorbers leaking prematurely, resulting in a bouncy or unstable ride.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers. Replacing both sides is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the car sits unused for a few days. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws from aftermarket accessories or faulty electrical components. Replace the battery if it tests weak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (battery); Varies depending on the source of the parasitic draw
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inconsistent operation with the backup camera**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may have inconsistent behavior, exhibiting a lag when starting up, or going out all together.
    *   Solution: Replace the camera
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced cooling capacity from the AC system. May only blow warm air or take a very long time to cool.
    *   Solution: Could be a leak in the AC system. Refilling the refrigerant can potentially solve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Nissan Note, while a practical and fuel-efficient vehicle, does have some potential issues to be aware of. The most concerning issue is the potential for premature CVT failure, which can be costly to repair. Other issues, such as battery drain, rear shock absorber leaks, and sensor failures are less severe but can still be inconvenient. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for these issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
