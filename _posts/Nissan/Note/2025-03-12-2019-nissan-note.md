The 2019 Nissan Note is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and spacious interior. While it's not sold in the US, it is sold in other markets and comes with different engine options. The most common engine available is the 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine, producing around 79 horsepower and 80 lb-ft of torque, or a supercharged version producing around 97 horsepower and 108 lb-ft of torque. Both engine options are typically paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Note's practicality, comfortable ride, and excellent gas mileage. Common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired styling and the CVT's characteristic drone under acceleration.
