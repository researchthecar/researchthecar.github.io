**Introduction**

The 1992 Nissan Hikari was a popular sedan that offered a comfortable and reliable driving experience. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder and a 3.0-liter V6. The 4-cylinder produced 115 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque, while the V6 produced 155 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, sending power to the front wheels. The Hikari was praised for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and fuel efficiency. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power and poor handling.

## **Engine**
### **2.0-liter 4-cylinder**
- **Oil leaks:** The engine may develop oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets or rear main seal. Symptoms include a burning oil smell, smoke from the engine bay, and low oil levels. The fix involves replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. Estimated cost: $200 - $500+

### **3.0-liter V6**
- **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner may fail, causing the timing chain to skip or break. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, decreased performance, and eventually engine failure. The fix involves replacing the timing chain tensioner and timing chain. Estimated cost: $800 - $1500+

## **Transmission**
### **4-speed automatic**
- **Shifting problems:** The transmission may experience shifting problems, such as slipping, hard shifting, or refusing to shift. Symptoms include delayed or erratic gear changes, a lack of response from the transmission, and transmission warning lights on the dashboard. The fix may involve replacing the transmission fluid and filter, adjusting the shift linkage, or replacing the transmission control module. Estimated cost: $200 - $1000+

## **Suspension**
- **Strut mounts:** The strut mounts may wear out, causing a clunking noise when driving over bumps or potholes. Symptoms include a knocking or rattling noise, poor handling, and reduced stability. The fix involves replacing the strut mounts. Estimated cost: $150 - $250 per mount

- **Control arm bushings:** The control arm bushings may wear out, causing a clunking noise when driving over bumps or potholes. Symptoms include a knocking or rattling noise, poor handling, and reduced stability. The fix involves replacing the control arm bushings. Estimated cost: $200 - $400 per bushing

## **Electrical**
- **Alternator failure:** The alternator may fail, causing the battery to not charge properly. Symptoms include dim headlights, flickering lights, and a dead battery. The fix involves replacing the alternator. Estimated cost: $300 - $500+

- **Starter failure:** The starter may fail, preventing the engine from starting. Symptoms include a clicking noise when turning the key, no response from the engine, and a dead battery. The fix involves replacing the starter. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+

## **Exterior**
- **Rust on body panels:** The Hikari may develop rust on the body panels, particularly on the rear wheel arches and trunk lid. Symptoms include visible rust spots, peeling paint, and body damage. The fix involves repairing or replacing the affected body panels. Estimated cost: $500 - $2000+

## **Interior**
- **Dashboard cracking:** The dashboard may crack due to exposure to sunlight or heat. Symptoms include cracks or splits on the dashboard surface. The fix involves replacing the dashboard. Estimated cost: $400 - $800+

- **Air conditioning problems:** The air conditioning system may experience problems, such as a lack of cold air, poor air flow, or a refrigerant leak. Symptoms include warm or insufficiently cooled air, a lack of response from the air conditioning system, and a hissing noise. The fix may involve repairing or replacing the compressor, condenser, evaporator, or other components of the air conditioning system. Estimated cost: $500 - $1500+

## **Summary**

Overall, the 1992 Nissan Hikari is a reliable and comfortable sedan with a few common issues. The most severe and expensive problems are related to the engine, such as timing chain tensioner failure and oil leaks. Other issues, such as suspension wear and electrical problems, are more common but less costly to fix.
