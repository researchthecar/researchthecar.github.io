The 2017 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and spacious interior. It was offered with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 130 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque in most trims, and a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 188 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque in the SR Turbo trim. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Sentra's comfortable ride and good gas mileage, but some dislike the somewhat uninspired driving experience and the CVT's performance.
