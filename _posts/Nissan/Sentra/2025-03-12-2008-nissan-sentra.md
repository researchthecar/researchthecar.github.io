The 2008 Nissan Sentra is a compact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. Many owners appreciate the car's comfortable ride and spacious interior for its class, but common complaints include issues with the continuously variable transmission (CVT), excessive oil consumption, and electrical problems.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (MR20DE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, options range from using a thicker oil, replacing the PCV valve, or a complete engine rebuild to replace piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV valve) to $3,000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can cause rough idling, decreased power, and the check engine light to illuminate. This can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil, spark plugs, or fuel injector. Diagnosis is key to identifying the specific culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission exhibits slipping, hesitation during acceleration, or a lack of power. The transmission can also overheat.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change might provide temporary relief, but often the CVT requires replacement or a rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (Fluid Change) to $3,000+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining noise coming from the transmission, especially during acceleration. This indicates internal wear within the CVT.
    *   Solution: CVT replacement is the most common solution, as internal repairs are often not cost-effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll in corners, and bottoming out over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Noisy Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, particularly when driving over uneven surfaces. This is often caused by worn sway bar links or bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn sway bar links and/or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Airbag Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag light illuminated on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the airbag sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure, difficulty starting the vehicle, and dimming headlights.
    *   Solution: Replace the battery and check the charging system for any issues (alternator, wiring).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting Underbody**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive rust formation on the vehicle's undercarriage, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, rust inhibitor application.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard.

**Summary:** The 2008 Nissan Sentra, while offering good fuel economy and a comfortable interior, is plagued by several issues. The most significant and costly problem is the high failure rate of the CVT transmission. Excessive oil consumption is also a common concern. Suspension and electrical problems, while less severe, can also add to the ownership costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected, especially the transmission, before purchasing.
