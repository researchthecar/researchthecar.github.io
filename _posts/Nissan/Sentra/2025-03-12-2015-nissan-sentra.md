The 2015 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and spacious interior. The 2015 Sentra is powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 130 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (available on the base S trim) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Sentra's comfortable ride and affordability, but some common complaints include lackluster acceleration and issues with the CVT transmission.

**Engine**

**1.8L 4-Cylinder**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning light, engine knocking, and potentially engine damage if left unaddressed.
    * Solution: In some cases, Nissan has advised performing an oil consumption test to determine the severity. Replacement of piston rings and/or engine replacement may be necessary depending on the results.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The most prevalent issue with the 2015 Sentra is CVT failure. Symptoms include jerking, hesitation during acceleration, shuddering, high RPMs with little power, and the transmission slipping or failing to engage. In some cases, the transmission enters "limp mode," restricting speed.
    * Solution: Replacing the CVT is often the only permanent solution. Fluid changes may temporarily alleviate symptoms in some cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $4,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report premature wear or failure of the struts and shocks, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected struts or shocks. It is typically recommended to replace struts/shocks in pairs (both front or both rear).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per pair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, even with a relatively new battery. This can result in the car not starting, especially after sitting for extended periods.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the parasitic drain by testing individual circuits. Common culprits can be aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a malfunctioning charging system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may blow warm air or intermittently stop working. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the A/C system, which may involve leak testing, compressor testing, and blend door actuator testing. Repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Nissan Sentra is generally a reliable and affordable compact car, but it is susceptible to some notable issues. The most concerning is the potential for CVT failure, which is a costly repair. Other issues, such as excessive oil consumption, premature strut/shock failure, battery drain, and A/C issues, can also be problematic and potentially costly to address. Prospective buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect any used 2015 Sentra before purchasing, paying close attention to the condition of the transmission.
