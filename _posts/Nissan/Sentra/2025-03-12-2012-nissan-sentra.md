The 2012 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It was offered with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine that produced 140 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While owners appreciate the Sentra's fuel economy and spacious interior for its class, common complaints include the CVT transmission reliability and some issues with interior quality.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.0L engine consuming more oil than usual, leading to the need for frequent top-offs. This can be more pronounced at higher mileage. Symptoms include low oil light illumination and the need to add oil between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed is a short-term solution. A more permanent fix may involve replacing valve stem seals or piston rings, depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter can fail prematurely, resulting in a check engine light with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most prevalent issue reported with the 2012 Sentra is related to the CVT transmission. Symptoms include jerking, hesitation, slipping, and complete transmission failure. These issues often occur at relatively low mileage.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update may alleviate the symptoms. However, in many instances, the CVT needs to be replaced or rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+ (for replacement); $2000 - $4000 (for rebuild, depending on the extent of damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems within the valve body can lead to erratic shifting, delayed engagement, and overall poor transmission performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of strut mounts can cause clunking or rattling noises, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (per strut)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of parasitic drain and repair of faulty component (e.g., faulty relay, malfunctioning module). Replacement of the battery if it has been excessively discharged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Switch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power window switches can fail, preventing the windows from operating properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust, especially in areas prone to salt exposure, is common, especially on the undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, rust inhibitors
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (Depending on severity of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks, particularly in warmer climates, due to prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or use of a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (Dashboard cover); $800-$1500+ (Dashboard replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2012 Nissan Sentra has some notable issues, the most concerning being the potential for CVT transmission failure, which can be a costly repair. Engine oil consumption is also a prevalent issue. Other issues like strut mount noise and electrical problems are less severe but should be considered. Buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle's maintenance history, test the transmission extensively, and check for any signs of oil consumption or electrical issues before purchasing.
