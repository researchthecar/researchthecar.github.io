**Introduction:**

The 2004 Nissan Sentra offers drivers a reliable and fuel-efficient sedan with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 1.8-liter inline-four with 126 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. An optional 2.5-liter inline-four engine produces 165 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, available with a 6-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. Despite its compact size, the Sentra offers a spacious interior and a host of convenient features. However, it has also been plagued by a number of issues.

**Engine**

**1.8-liter inline-four**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** This issue is characterized by coolant and oil leaks, overheating, and reduced engine performance. The intake manifold gasket needs to be replaced, which typically costs around $300 - $500+.
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** A faulty timing chain tensioner can cause a rattling noise and reduced engine performance. Replacing the timing chain tensioner usually costs between $400 - $700+.
* **Valve body failure (automatic transmission only):** This issue can lead to erratic shifting, slipping gears, and eventual transmission failure. Replacing the valve body is a major repair that can cost up to $1,500 or more.

**2.5-liter inline-four**

* **Oil consumption:** Some Sentra models equipped with the 2.5-liter engine have been known to consume excessive oil. Regular oil changes and monitoring are recommended to prevent engine damage.
* **Throttle position sensor failure:** A faulty throttle position sensor can cause rough idling, stalling, and poor acceleration. Replacing the sensor typically costs around $200 - $400+.
* **Crankshaft position sensor failure:** This issue can lead to starting problems, stalling, and reduced engine performance. Replacing the crankshaft position sensor usually costs between $100 - $250+.

**Transmission**

**5-speed manual**

* **Clutch failure:** A worn clutch can cause slipping, difficulty shifting gears, and eventually transmission failure. Replacing the clutch is a major repair that typically costs $600 - $1,000+.
* **Synchronizer failure:** Worn synchronizers can make it difficult to shift gears smoothly. Replacing synchronizers is a complex repair that can cost $1,000 or more.

**4-speed automatic**

* **Valve body failure:** As mentioned above, a faulty valve body can cause erratic shifting and transmission failure. Replacing the valve body is a major repair that can cost up to $1,500 or more.
* **Torque converter failure:** A faulty torque converter can cause slipping, harsh shifting, and overheating. Replacing the torque converter typically costs around $1,000 - $1,500+.

**Suspension**

* **Strut failure:** Worn or damaged struts can cause a rough ride, reduced handling, and excessive tire wear. Replacing struts usually costs between $500 - $700 per axle.
* **Sway bar link failure:** Broken or worn sway bar links can cause knocking or rattling noises and reduced handling. Replacing sway bar links is a relatively inexpensive repair that typically costs around $100 - $200 per side.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** A faulty alternator can cause charging problems, electrical system failures, and a dead battery. Replacing an alternator usually costs around $500 - $700+.
* **Starter failure:** A faulty starter can prevent the engine from starting or cause it to start intermittently. Replacing the starter typically costs between $300 - $500+.
* **Battery drain:** Some Sentra models have been known to experience excessive battery drain, which can lead to a dead battery. Diagnosing and fixing the cause of battery drain can be complex and costly.

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** Some Sentra models have been known to rust prematurely, particularly on the rear quarter panels and around the wheel arches. Rust repair costs can vary depending on the severity of the damage.
* **Headlight condensation:** Condensation buildup inside the headlights is a common problem that can lead to reduced visibility. Replacing the headlights is necessary, costing around $500 - $700 per side.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard cracking:** Some Sentra models have been known to experience dashboard cracking over time. The extent of the cracking and repair costs can vary.
* **Climate control failure:** Malfunctioning climate control systems can cause problems with heating or cooling the cabin. Replacing climate control components can cost between $200 - $600+.
* **Power window failure:** Broken or worn power window motors or switches can prevent windows from operating properly. Replacing power window components usually costs around $200 - $400 per window.

**Summary**

The 2004 Nissan Sentra offers a mix of reliability and fuel efficiency, but it has been plagued by a number of significant issues. The cost and severity of these issues vary depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage. Some issues, such as engine gasket failure and transmission problems, can be costly to repair. Others, such as interior problems and minor electrical issues, are relatively inexpensive to fix. Overall, the 2004 Nissan Sentra has a mixed reputation, with some owners reporting major problems while others have experienced few issues.
