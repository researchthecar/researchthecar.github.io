**Engine**

**2.0L Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 2023 Sentra consumes an excessive amount of engine oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be indicated by the low oil pressure warning light, a burning oil smell, or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The solution depends on the cause. It could involve replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or the entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can cause the engine to run rough, vibrate excessively, and experience a loss of power. The check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the cause of the misfire, which could involve replacing spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can manifest as a delay in response when pressing the accelerator or a sudden, unexpected jolt.
    *   Solution: A software update or CVT fluid change may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or high-pitched noise coming from the transmission area, especially during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: This may indicate wear or damage within the CVT. A CVT fluid change might temporarily alleviate the noise, but a CVT replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature failure of the struts, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. This can also result in unusual noises, such as clunking or rattling sounds, from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per strut

**Electrical**

**Summary**

The 2023 Nissan Sentra has some common issues, particularly related to the engine's oil consumption and the CVT's performance.
