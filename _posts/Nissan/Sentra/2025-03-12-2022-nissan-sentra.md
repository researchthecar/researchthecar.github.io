The 2022 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and good fuel economy. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 149 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While praised for its value and spacious interior, some owners have reported issues with the CVT transmission, electrical glitches, and minor interior trim concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 2022 Sentra with the 2.0L engine is consuming an abnormal amount of oil, requiring more frequent oil changes than usual. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, the need to add oil between changes, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: The fix varies depending on the cause. It could involve replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or, in more severe cases, the entire engine. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the root cause.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the severity and required repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. The CVT may feel sluggish or unresponsive, and the car might shudder when accelerating from a stop or during light throttle inputs.
    * Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve some cases. In other cases, a CVT fluid change can help. In more severe cases, CVT replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $4000+ (CVT replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, including the touchscreen display, may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect access to navigation, audio, and other vehicle settings.
    * Solution: A software update to the infotainment system is often the first step. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Backup Camera Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure or distortion of the backup camera display. The camera may display a black screen, distorted image, or simply not activate when the vehicle is in reverse.
    * Solution: Check the camera's wiring and connections. Replacement of the camera itself may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found
