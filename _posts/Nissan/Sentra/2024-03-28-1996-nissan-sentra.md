The 1996 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan offered with a choice of two engines: a 1.6-liter inline-four and a 2.0-liter inline-four. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Sentra is praised for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and ease of driving, but it has received some complaints about its performance and overall quality.
