**1999 Nissan Sentra**

The 1999 Nissan Sentra was a compact sedan that was offered with three engine options: a 1.6-liter inline-four (GA16DE), a 1.8-liter inline-four (SR20DE), or a 2.0-liter inline-four (QR20DE). The GA16DE produced 115 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque, while the SR20DE produced 126 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. The QR20DE was available only in the SE-R trim and produced 145 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The Sentra was offered with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

People liked the Sentra for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and sporty handling. However, some people complained about the Sentra's lack of power, especially when equipped with the GA16DE or SR20DE engine. Others found the interior to be cramped and the ride to be too stiff.
