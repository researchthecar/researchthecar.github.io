### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Nissan Sentra, particularly models equipped with the 2.0L engine and CVT transmission, shows a tendency for transmission-related issues and some engine oil consumption concerns. The CVT, while offering fuel efficiency, appears to be a point of vulnerability requiring diligent maintenance and potentially costly repairs. Other areas like suspension components (struts, rear axle) and certain electrical modules (BCM) have also been noted for potential failures. Exterior paint issues and interior wear on seats are also reported. The 1.8L engine and manual transmission variants appear to be more robust. Overall, while not plagued by widespread critical failures, potential buyers should be aware of the CVT's reputation and consider the costs associated with these specific components.
