**The 2002 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan that was available with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine and a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.** The Sentra was praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and roomy interior, but some owners reported issues with its engine, transmission, and other components.

**Engine**

* **1.8-liter Four-Cylinder**
    * **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** Oil may leak from the valve cover gasket, causing an oil leak. Replacing the gasket is the solution, and it typically costs between $150 and $300.
    * **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, resulting in a rattling noise from the engine. Replacing the timing chain tensioner is the solution, and it typically costs between $500 and $800.

**Transmission**

* **Five-Speed Manual:**
    * **Transmission Mount Failure:** The transmission mount can fail, causing the transmission to shift out of gear. Replacing the transmission mount is the solution, and it typically costs between $200 and $400.
    * **Clutch Failure:** The clutch can wear out over time, resulting in difficulty shifting gears. Replacing the clutch is the solution, and it typically costs between $800 and $1,200.
* **Four-Speed Automatic:**
    * **Transmission Fluid Leak:** The transmission fluid can leak from the transmission pan or lines, resulting in a loss of fluid. Replacing the leaking component is the solution, and it typically costs between $200 and $600.
    * **Solenoid Failure:** The transmission solenoid can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically. Replacing the solenoid is the solution, and it typically costs between $300 and $500.

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Headlight Switch Failure:** The headlight switch can fail, resulting in the headlights not working. Replacing the headlight switch is the solution, and it typically costs between $100 and $200.
* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain over time, even when the car is not in use. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component. Identifying and repairing the source of the draw is the solution, and the cost can vary depending on the cause.

**Exterior**

* **Clear Coat Peeling:** The clear coat on the exterior paint can peel, leaving the paint exposed to the elements. Repainting the affected areas is the solution, and it typically costs between $500 and $1,000 per panel.

**Interior**

* **Center Console Lid Breakage:** The center console lid can break at the hinge, rendering it unusable. Replacing the center console lid is the solution, and it typically costs between $100 and $200.
* **Door Handle Failure:** The door handle can break, making it difficult to open the door. Replacing the door handle is the solution, and it typically costs between $50 and $150 per door.

**Overall**

The 2002 Nissan Sentra is a generally reliable vehicle, but it can experience some common issues. Engine and transmission problems are relatively rare, but they can be expensive to repair. Suspension and electrical issues are also infrequent, but they can be inconvenient. Interior issues are typically minor and inexpensive to fix. Exterior issues, such as clear coat peeling, can be unsightly but are not typically major concerns.
