### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Nissan Sentra offers a generally dependable ownership experience, particularly with its manual transmission variant. However, the prevalent CVT transmission has been a source of concern for some owners, with reports of overheating and premature failure. Engine oil consumption is another noted issue that requires diligent monitoring. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and keyless entry problems, can also arise. While the suspension and exterior/interior components are largely robust, potential buyers should be aware of the CVT's reputation and ensure any pre-owned Sentra has a well-documented maintenance history, especially concerning the transmission fluid.
