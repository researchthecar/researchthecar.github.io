### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Nissan Sentra offers a budget-friendly option, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engines, particularly the 1.8L and 2.0L variants, can experience oil and coolant leaks, and the 2.0L may develop timing chain rattle or oil consumption problems. Automatic transmissions are prone to harsh shifting and torque converter issues. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear out, leading to ride and handling problems. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty power window actuators and instrument clusters, are also reported. Exterior rust, especially on lower body panels, is a concern in certain climates. Interior issues like HVAC blower motor and door lock actuator failures are also noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble are crucial for maintaining the reliability of a 2003 Sentra.
