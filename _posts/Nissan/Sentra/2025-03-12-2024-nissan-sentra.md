The 2024 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan known for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency, and value. All trims come standard with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 149 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many drivers appreciate the Sentra's spacious interior, user-friendly technology, and smooth driving experience. However, some common criticisms include its somewhat uninspired acceleration and the CVT's characteristic drone under heavy acceleration.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This may be indicated by the low oil pressure light illuminating, or the driver may observe blueish smoke emitting from the exhaust pipe
    *   Solution: The solution to this issue may involve replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jerking and Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some drivers experience noticeable jerking or hesitation, particularly during low-speed acceleration or when shifting between drive and reverse. This can feel like a sudden lurch or lag in power delivery.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid flush and software update can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush and Software Update: $200 - $400, CVT Replacement: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or high-pitched noise coming from the transmission area, especially during acceleration. This noise may become more pronounced as the vehicle ages.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid flush and filter change may help reduce the noise. If the noise continues, the CVT may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Flush and Filter Change: $250 - $500, CVT Replacement: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes unexpectedly. This can interrupt navigation, audio playback, and other functions.
    *   Solution: Try performing a system reset by holding the power button. A software update may also resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: $0 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poor Quality Factory Paint**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have complained about the factory paint being extremely thin. This results in easy chipping from rocks and road debris, especially on the front of the vehicle and along the rocker panels.
    *   Solution: Installing paint protection film, or having the vehicle professionally repainted.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Paint Protection Film: $1000 - $2000+, Repainting: $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard, particularly when driving on rough roads. The source of the rattle can be difficult to pinpoint.
    *   Solution: Identifying the specific source of the rattle and tightening loose components or adding insulation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Nissan Sentra presents some potential issues, primarily involving the CVT, engine, and electrical systems. While some problems are relatively minor, others, like CVT failure or excessive oil consumption, can be more costly to repair. Owners should pay close attention to transmission behavior, oil levels, and infotainment system performance to identify and address potential issues early on.
