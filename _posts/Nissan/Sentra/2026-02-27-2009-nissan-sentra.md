### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Nissan Sentra generally presents as a reliable compact car, particularly when equipped with the manual transmission. The most significant concerns tend to revolve around the CVT transmission, which has been known to experience overheating and failure, as well as potential valve body issues. Engine-wise, oil consumption is a reported concern for both the 2.0L and 2.5L engines, and the 2.5L can also exhibit timing chain problems. Electrical issues are relatively minor, with power window regulators and keyless entry fobs being the most common culprits. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread technical defects. Prospective buyers should pay close attention to the transmission's service history and condition, and be mindful of potential oil consumption in the engine.
