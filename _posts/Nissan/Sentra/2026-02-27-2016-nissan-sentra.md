### Summary Verdict

The primary area of concern revolves around the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), which has been associated with overheating, slipping, and premature failure, often requiring costly repairs or replacement. Some owners have also reported instances of excessive oil consumption with the 1.8L engine. Electrical issues, such as infotainment system glitches and key fob malfunctions, are also noted but are typically less severe. The suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread significant issues. Prospective buyers should pay close attention to the maintenance history of the CVT if considering a model equipped with it.
