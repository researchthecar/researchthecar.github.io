The 2009 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 (140 hp, 147 lb-ft torque) and a 2.5-liter inline-4 (177 hp, 170 lb-ft torque) found in the SE-R trim. Transmission choices are a 6-speed manual, a 5-speed manual (very rare), or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Sentra's spacious interior and comfortable ride, but some dislike its unremarkable styling and the CVT's performance.

**Summary**

The 2009 Nissan Sentra, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The most significant concern revolves around the CVT transmission, which can be prone to failure, incurring substantial repair costs. Other issues, such as catalytic converter failure, excessive oil consumption in the SE-R, and electrical problems, are also worth noting. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs, particularly those involving the transmission or engine, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should have the car thoroughly inspected, paying close attention to the transmission's condition and maintenance history.
