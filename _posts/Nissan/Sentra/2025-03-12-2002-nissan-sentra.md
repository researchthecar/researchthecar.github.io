The 2002 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and reliability, although like any vehicle, it has its share of common problems. Engine options for this model year included a 1.8L four-cylinder engine producing 126 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Sentra's simple design, practicality, and affordability. However, some common complaints include the car's lack of power compared to other vehicles on the road, interior build quality, and some reliability issues as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**1.8L I4 (QG18DE)**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter fails, often due to oil consumption, resulting in the check engine light illuminating with codes related to catalyst inefficiency. This can also cause the vehicle to fail emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. Addressing any oil consumption issues beforehand is advisable to prevent premature failure of the new converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored and corrected. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a complete engine rebuild is required. Less invasive repairs may involve replacing valve stem seals and piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Distributor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The distributor may fail causing the engine to not start or stall.
    *   Solution: Replace the distributor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic transmission exhibits slipping between gears or harsh/delayed shifting. This is sometimes accompanied by a "check engine" light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transmission or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Deteriorated strut mounts, leading to clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts. It's often recommended to replace struts and shocks at the same time if they're worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls randomly or fails to start at all. Check Engine light may illuminate with a code relating to crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine runs rough, idles poorly, and has reduced power. Can trigger the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust in areas such as the wheel wells and rocker panels.
    *   Solution: Cutting out the rust and welding in new sheet metal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard develops cracks, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement is the most complete solution, but can be costly. A dashboard cover is a less expensive alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (cover) - $1,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2002 Nissan Sentra, while generally reliable, has some recurring issues owners should be aware of. Engine issues, especially related to catalytic converter and oil consumption, can be costly to address. Transmission problems in the automatic versions can also be a significant expense. Suspension and electrical issues, while less critical, can still impact the driving experience. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but it's crucial to consider them when evaluating a used 2002 Nissan Sentra.
