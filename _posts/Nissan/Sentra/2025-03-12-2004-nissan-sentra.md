The 2004 Nissan Sentra is a compact car known for its reliability and fuel efficiency, but like any vehicle, it has its share of potential problems. Engine options included the 1.8L inline-4 (QG18DE) producing 126 hp and 129 lb-ft of torque, which was the most common, and the 2.5L inline-4 (QR25DE) with 165 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque, found in the SE-R and SE-R Spec V trims. Both engines could be paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, while the 1.8L could also be equipped with a 4-speed automatic. The SE-R Spec V came with a 6-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the Sentra's affordability and fuel economy, but some dislike its basic interior and relatively uninspired driving dynamics compared to sportier rivals.

**Summary**

The 2004 Nissan Sentra, while generally reliable, has a few common issues to watch out for. The 2.5L QR25DE engine in the SE-R models is prone to pre-catalytic converter failure and excessive oil consumption, which can lead to costly repairs. The 1.8L QG18DE engine may suffer from catalytic converter and valve cover gasket issues. Electrical problems like MAF sensor and alternator failures are also relatively common. Rust, particularly in areas with harsh weather, can also be a concern. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive engine or transmission repairs, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2004 Sentra.
