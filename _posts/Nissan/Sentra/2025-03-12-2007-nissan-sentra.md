The 2007 Nissan Sentra offered practicality and fuel efficiency. Two engine options were available: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter inline-4. Transmission choices included a 6-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciated the Sentra's fuel economy and comfortable ride, while some common complaints included the CVT reliability and interior material quality.
