The 2006 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. Engine options included a 1.8L inline-4 (126 hp, 129 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.5L inline-4 (175 hp, 180 lb-ft of torque) found in the SE-R and SE-R Spec V trims. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual (only with the 2.5L engine), and a 4-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2006 Nissan Sentra is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as catalytic converter failure, O2 sensor problems, automatic transmission issues (especially with the 4-speed), and rust on the rear quarter panels. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L and valve cover gasket leaks in both engines are also potential concerns. The severity of these issues ranges from minor repairs like replacing an O2 sensor to more costly repairs such as catalytic converter replacement or transmission work. Overall, keeping an eye out for these common problems during a pre-purchase inspection can help buyers make a more informed decision.
