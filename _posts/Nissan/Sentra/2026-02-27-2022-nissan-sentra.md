### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Nissan Sentra demonstrates a generally solid reliability record for its model year. The primary powertrain, a 2.0L 4-cylinder engine paired with a CVT, is largely trouble-free, though some owners have reported minor transmission hesitation or jerking, which can often be addressed with software updates or fluid services. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment screen freezing, are also noted, usually resolvable through software. Premature 12V battery failure is a possibility, as with many vehicles. Beyond these specific points, the Sentra's suspension, exterior, and interior components appear to be holding up well, with no significant widespread issues reported. Overall, the Sentra is a reliable choice for daily commuting, with potential issues being relatively minor and manageable.
