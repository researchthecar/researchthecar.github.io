The 2010 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It came with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter inline-4, available only on the SE-R and SE-R Spec V, producing 177 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0-liter engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the SE-R versions came exclusively with either a 6-speed manual (Spec V) or a specially tuned CVT. Owners generally appreciate the Sentra's fuel economy and spacious interior for its class. Common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired styling and the CVT's performance, which some find sluggish or noisy.

**Engine**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.0L, some owners experience high oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Repair options are the same as the 2.0L engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Nissan Sentra, while economical, has some noteworthy issues, particularly related to its CVT transmission and potential for engine oil consumption. CVT issues are often the most expensive to address, potentially costing several thousand dollars. Other common problems, like strut mount noise and electrical issues, are generally less severe and cheaper to fix. It's crucial to thoroughly inspect the transmission's performance and engine oil levels when considering the purchase of a used 2010 Sentra.
