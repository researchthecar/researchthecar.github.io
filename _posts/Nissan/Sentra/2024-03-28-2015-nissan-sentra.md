The 2015 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan available with three engine options: a 1.6L inline-4 (109 hp/109 lb-ft), a 1.8L inline-4 (130 hp/128 lb-ft), and a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 (188 hp/177 lb-ft). Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a 6-speed automatic.
