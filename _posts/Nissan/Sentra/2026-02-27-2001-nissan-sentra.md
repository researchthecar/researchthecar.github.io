- **Solution:** No widespread issues reported.
- **Cost:** N/A


### 4-Speed Automatic (RE4F03A)
**Slipping or Delayed Shifting**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission may slip between gears, hesitate to shift, or feel jerky during acceleration. Low fluid level or worn internal components can be the cause.
- **Solution:** Check and top off transmission fluid. If the issue persists, a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may be needed. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement is required.
- **Cost:** $250 - $600 (fluid service/flush), $1500 - $3500 (rebuild/replacement)


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Struts/Shocks**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive bouncing after hitting bumps, poor handling, uneven tire wear, and clunking noises from the suspension.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn struts or shocks. Alignment may be necessary after replacement.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800 (for a set of four)


## Electrical

### General Electrical System
**Power Window Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows may become slow, stop working intermittently, or fail to operate altogether.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the faulty power window motor/regulator assembly.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400 per window

**Instrument Cluster Malfunctions**
- **Symptoms:** Gauges (speedometer, tachometer, fuel level) may become erratic, fail to register, or the entire cluster may go dark.
- **Solution:** Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster. Sometimes a loose connection can be the cause.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700


## Exterior

### Body Panels & Trim
**Clear Coat Peeling**
- **Symptoms:** The clear coat on the paint begins to flake or peel, particularly on horizontal surfaces like the roof and hood, leading to faded paint.
- **Solution:** Repainting affected areas or the entire vehicle. This is primarily an aesthetic issue.
- **Cost:** $500 - $3000+ (depending on the extent of damage and quality of repaint)


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blower Motor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** The cabin fan stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents, regardless of the fan speed setting.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blower motor and potentially the blower motor resistor.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400

### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Nissan Sentra is generally a dependable vehicle, especially with its standard 1.8L and 2.0L engines, which show no widespread issues. The 4-speed automatic transmission is the most common area for concern, with potential for slipping or shifting problems that can be costly to repair. Suspension components like struts can wear out, leading to handling issues. Electrical gremlins, such as power window failures and instrument cluster problems, are also noted. Exterior paint can suffer from clear coat degradation over time. Interiorly, the HVAC blower motor is a component that may require replacement. Overall, while not immune to age-related problems, the Sentra remains a reasonably reliable choice if these potential issues are addressed.
