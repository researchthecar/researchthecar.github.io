## Engine

### 1.8L DOHC 4-Cylinder
**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage if not monitored.
- **Solution:** Regular oil level checks and top-offs. In some cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
- **Cost:** $1,200 - $2,500

**CVT Transmission Issues (Related to Engine Cooling)**
- **Symptoms:** Hesitation, rough shifting, overheating, or failure of the CVT. Often linked to inadequate cooling of the transmission fluid, which is managed by the engine's cooling system.
- **Solution:** Ensure the cooling system is in good condition, including radiator and coolant levels. CVT fluid changes at recommended intervals. Transmission replacement may be required in severe cases.
- **Cost:** $2,500 - $5,000


## Transmission

### CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)
**CVT Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Jerking, slipping, whining noises, or complete loss of drive. Often occurs after higher mileage.
- **Solution:** Regular fluid changes are crucial. Transmission replacement is the typical solution for significant failures.
- **Cost:** $2,500 - $5,000


### 6-Speed Manual Transmission
**No widespread issues reported.**
- **Symptoms:** No widespread issues reported.
- **Solution:** No widespread issues reported.
- **Cost:** No widespread issues reported.

### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Nissan Sentra demonstrates a generally positive reliability record, particularly with its 1.8L engine when properly maintained. The primary concern revolves around the CVT transmission, which has been known to experience premature failure or issues related to overheating and inadequate cooling, often requiring costly repairs or replacement. The 6-speed manual transmission variant is significantly more reliable. Engine oil consumption can also be a factor to monitor. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are typically robust and do not present widespread issues. Regular maintenance, especially for the CVT fluid and cooling system, is highly recommended to mitigate potential problems and ensure longevity.
