### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Nissan Sentra is a generally reliable compact car, particularly with the manual transmission. The most significant concern revolves around the CVT transmission, which can be prone to failure or performance issues, leading to substantial repair costs. Engine-wise, both the 2.0L and 2.5L engines can experience oil consumption and timing chain noise, requiring diligent monitoring and potential repairs. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are typically robust. Prospective buyers should pay close attention to the transmission's history and condition, and be prepared for potential engine-related maintenance.
