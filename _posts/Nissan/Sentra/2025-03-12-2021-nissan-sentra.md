The 2021 Nissan Sentra is a compact sedan known for its comfortable ride, stylish design, and fuel efficiency. It comes equipped with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 149 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Sentra's value for money, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. However, some common complaints include the CVT's performance characteristics, the somewhat lackluster acceleration, and occasional issues with the electronics.

**Engine**

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Juddering/Shaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced a juddering or shaking sensation, particularly during acceleration or at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or hesitating.
    *   Solution: A software update, transmission fluid flush, or, in more severe cases, CVT replacement may be required.

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining noise emanating from the transmission area, especially during acceleration. The noise might increase in intensity with vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: This is often indicative of internal CVT wear. Depending on the severity, a fluid change *might* help temporarily. However, CVT replacement is often the ultimate solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change)- $4,000+ (CVT replacement)

**Summary**

The 2021 Nissan Sentra, while generally reliable, can experience a range of issues. The most concerning are potential problems with the CVT, which can be costly to repair or replace. Electrical glitches, such as infotainment system issues, are also relatively common. While some issues may be minor and easily resolved, others can be more serious and expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, and potentially consider an extended warranty for powertrain components, especially given the possible CVT concerns.
