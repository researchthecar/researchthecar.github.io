### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Nissan Sentra presents a mixed reliability profile. Engines like the 1.8L and 2.5L have documented issues with oil consumption and other specific component failures, while the 2.0L appears more robust. The CVT transmission is a notable concern, with reports of hesitation, jerking, and overheating, often requiring costly repairs. Manual transmissions are generally more reliable. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear out, leading to common ride and handling issues. Electrical problems, such as power window motors and instrument clusters, are also reported. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates. Overall, while the Sentra can be an economical choice, potential buyers should be aware of the specific powertrain and component weaknesses, particularly the CVT, and factor in potential repair costs.
