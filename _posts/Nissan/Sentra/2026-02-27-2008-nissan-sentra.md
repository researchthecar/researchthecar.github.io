### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Nissan Sentra presents a mixed reliability profile. While the chassis and basic components are generally robust, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as oil consumption in both engine variants, CVT transmission failures, and electrical gremlins related to the BCM.
