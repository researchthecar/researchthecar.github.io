### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Nissan LEAF is generally a reliable electric vehicle, particularly for its intended use as a city commuter. The primary concerns revolve around the long-term health of the high-voltage battery pack, which can degrade over time, leading to reduced range and potentially costly replacement. Charging system issues and the 12V auxiliary battery are also points to monitor. Interior electronics, such as the infotainment screen, can occasionally exhibit glitches. However, the absence of a complex internal combustion engine and traditional transmission means fewer mechanical parts to fail. For buyers, understanding battery health and potential repair costs is crucial for a positive ownership experience.
