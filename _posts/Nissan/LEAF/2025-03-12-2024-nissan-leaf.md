The 2024 Nissan LEAF is an all-electric hatchback known for its affordability and practicality in the EV market. It comes in two main trims: the LEAF and the LEAF Plus. The standard LEAF is powered by a 40 kWh battery pack producing 147 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, while the LEAF Plus boasts a 60 kWh battery, upping the power to 214 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the LEAF's smooth and quiet ride, as well as its ease of use in urban environments. Criticisms typically focus on the relatively short range compared to newer EVs and the somewhat dated interior.

**Electric Motor**

**40 kWh Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car enters "turtle mode," severely limiting power output. This can occur due to thermal management issues with the battery pack, especially in hot climates, even when the battery shows a significant charge.
    *   Solution: In some cases, allowing the battery to cool down can temporarily alleviate the issue. However, a permanent fix often involves software updates to the battery management system (BMS) or, in severe cases, battery pack replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update can be free or up to $200. Battery pack replacement can range from $5,000 - $10,000 depending on warranty coverage and shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**60 kWh Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car enters "turtle mode," severely limiting power output. This can occur due to thermal management issues with the battery pack, especially in hot climates, even when the battery shows a significant charge.
    *   Solution: In some cases, allowing the battery to cool down can temporarily alleviate the issue. However, a permanent fix often involves software updates to the battery management system (BMS) or, in severe cases, battery pack replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update can be free or up to $200. Battery pack replacement can range from $5,000 - $10,000 depending on warranty coverage and shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Premature Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners in warmer climates may experience faster-than-expected battery capacity loss. The battery capacity bars on the dashboard may drop significantly within the first few years of ownership. This can lead to reduced range and increased charging frequency.
    *   Solution: While Nissan provides a warranty for battery capacity loss below a certain threshold, the remedy may be limited to a battery replacement with a refurbished unit. Some owners opt for aftermarket battery replacements with larger capacity packs if available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Refurbished battery pack replacement is covered under warranty or $5,000-10,000 without warranty. Aftermarket battery replacement $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Charging Port Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging or disengaging the charging cable. Error messages on the dashboard during charging. Charging process stops prematurely. This can be due to corrosion, physical damage, or software glitches.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the charging port and cable connectors can sometimes resolve minor issues. If the problem persists, the charging port itself may need to be replaced. Software updates may also address charging issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V accessory battery can drain prematurely, especially if the car is left unused for extended periods. This can prevent the car from starting or cause other electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the 12V battery is the most common fix. Using a trickle charger to maintain the battery's charge during periods of inactivity can help prevent this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing. This can reduce headlight brightness and potentially damage the headlight assembly over time.
    *   Solution: Some owners drill small drain holes to allow the moisture to escape. Replacing the headlight assembly is the most effective solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per headlight.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or updating the software can sometimes resolve these issues. In some cases, the entire infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software update) - $1,000+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Heated Seat Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heated seats may fail to heat up properly or may overheat. This could be due to a faulty heating element or a problem with the control module.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating element or the control module is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Nissan LEAF, while a practical and affordable EV, faces some common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around battery degradation and thermal management, leading to reduced power and range, particularly in hot climates. Electrical glitches, such as charging port issues and 12V battery drain, also appear. Interior issues like infotainment system glitches and heated seat malfunctions are present but less frequent. Suspension issues appear to be uncommon. While the battery issues can be costly, other fixes are generally less expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, especially if considering a used model.
