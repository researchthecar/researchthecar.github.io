The 2012 Nissan LEAF is an all-electric hatchback known for its affordability and eco-friendliness. It is only available with a single electric motor option, which produces 80 kW (107 hp) and 207 lb-ft of torque, paired with a single-speed reducer. Owners appreciate its quiet operation, low running costs, and zero emissions, but often dislike its limited range, long charging times, and battery degradation over time.

**Battery/Electric Motor**

* **Battery Capacity Loss/Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint is the gradual loss of battery capacity over time, resulting in a reduced driving range. The LEAF's battery capacity is displayed with "bars," and owners often report losing bars relatively quickly, especially in hot climates. Reduced range, even when fully charged, and longer charging times are symptoms.
    * Solution: While Nissan extended the battery warranty to 5 years/60,000 miles for capacity loss below 9 bars, replacing the battery is the long-term solution. A refurbished or new battery pack can restore the original range.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ for a new or refurbished battery pack.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The BMS monitors and controls the battery's charging and discharging processes. Problems can lead to inaccurate state-of-charge readings, premature charging termination, or even a complete battery failure.
    * Solution: A software update of the BMS may resolve some issues. In severe cases, replacement of the BMS control module may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the fix.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Motor Stator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The motor stator can fail, causing a loss of power or complete immobilization of the vehicle. Symptoms may include a warning light on the dashboard and a noticeable decrease in performance.
    * Solution: Replacement of the electric motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **12V Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The LEAF has a conventional 12V battery that powers accessories and starts the car's systems. This battery can drain quickly, especially if the car is left unused for extended periods, or if interior lights are left on. Symptoms include difficulty starting the car (even though the main battery is charged), and warning lights on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Jump-starting the 12V battery or replacing it. Addressing the source of the drain (e.g., faulty accessory, leaving lights on).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for a new 12V battery.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Charging Port Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Problems with the charging port, including difficulty connecting, slow charging speeds, or complete failure to charge. This could be due to damaged pins, debris in the port, or a faulty charging port assembly.
    * Solution: Cleaning the charging port, repairing or replacing damaged pins, or replacing the charging port assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Headlight Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Issues with the headlights not functioning properly, including dimming, flickering, or complete failure. This could be due to a faulty bulb or a wiring issue.
    * Solution: Replace bulb or fix wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Exterior**

* **Rear Hatch Corrosion**
    * Description/Symptoms: Corrosion around the rear hatch, particularly near the license plate lights and hinges. This is more prevalent in areas with harsh weather conditions.
    * Solution: Repairing the corrosion and repainting the affected area.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation system can experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure. The infotainment screen may also become unresponsive.
    * Solution: Software updates, system reset, or replacement of the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Nissan LEAF faces notable challenges primarily related to battery degradation, which significantly impacts its range and overall usability. Electrical issues, such as charging port problems and 12V battery drain, are also common. Exterior corrosion and infotainment system malfunctions can occur, but less frequently. The severity of battery degradation ranges from reduced range to complete battery failure, with replacement costs being substantial. While other issues are generally less expensive to fix, the potential for significant battery-related expenses should be a key consideration for prospective buyers.
