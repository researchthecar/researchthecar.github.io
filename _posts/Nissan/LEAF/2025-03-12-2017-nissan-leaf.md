The 2017 Nissan LEAF is a fully electric hatchback, offering a practical and environmentally conscious driving experience. It's powered by an 80 kW AC synchronous electric motor producing 107 horsepower and 187 lb-ft of torque. A single-speed reducer transmission is the only available option. Owners often praise the LEAF for its quiet operation, low running costs, and ease of driving. Common complaints include limited range compared to newer EVs, battery degradation over time, and relatively slow charging speeds.

**Battery/Electric Motor**

**AC Synchronous Electric Motor**

*   **Premature Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced driving range, particularly in hot or cold weather. Battery capacity decreases faster than expected, leading to significant range loss over a few years. Dash displays may inaccurately estimate remaining range.
    *   Solution: There is no simple fix; Nissan may offer replacement of the battery pack under warranty if the battery capacity falls below a certain threshold (typically 9 bars out of 12). Software updates may improve range estimates, but do not restore lost capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement can be very expensive out of warranty, potentially exceeding $5,000 - $10,000, depending on battery size (24 kWh or 30 kWh).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Error messages related to the battery appear on the dashboard. Reduced charging speeds or inability to charge. Complete failure of the battery pack, rendering the car undrivable.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the BMS by a qualified technician. Repair or replacement of the faulty BMS components or the entire BMS module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the issue and if the entire BMS is replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Port Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty connecting or disconnecting the charging cable. The charge port door may be difficult to open or close. Failure to initiate charging when plugged in. Error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the charging port for damage or corrosion. Replacement of the charging port assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the severity of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mount Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noise from the front suspension when going over bumps or turning. The noise is often more pronounced in cold weather.
    * Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts and possibly the struts themselves.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 for both sides.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V accessory battery, which powers the car's electronics, drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or complete failure to start.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic drain. It could be a faulty accessory, a malfunctioning module, or a wiring issue. Replacement of the 12V battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the complexity of the electrical issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, warning lights on the dashboard, inability to accelerate, or complete vehicle shutdown. The inverter converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the motor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the inverter by a qualified technician. Replacement of the inverter unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing. Can lead to reduced visibility and potential damage to the headlight assembly.
    * Solution: Replacement of the headlight housing or resealing the existing housing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per headlight, depending on the severity and if the whole assembly needs to be replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Navigation/Infotainment System Freezing or Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation or infotainment system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes frequently. Software glitches, outdated maps, or hardware issues can cause this.
    *   Solution: Software update if available. Resetting the system to factory settings. Replacement of the infotainment system if the issue persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $150 (software update), $500 - $2000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2017 Nissan LEAF is a generally reliable electric vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues, especially battery degradation. Battery and electrical problems are potentially the most expensive to fix, with costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars. Suspension and interior issues are generally less expensive to resolve. Regular maintenance, including monitoring battery health, can help prevent some problems.
