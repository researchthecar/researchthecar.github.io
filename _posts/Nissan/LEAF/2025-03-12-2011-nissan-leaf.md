The 2011 Nissan LEAF was a groundbreaking electric vehicle that offered a practical and efficient alternative to gasoline-powered cars. It was equipped with a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery pack and an 80 kW (107 hp) electric motor producing 207 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciated the LEAF for its quiet operation, low running costs, and zero-emission driving. However, some common complaints included limited range, battery degradation over time, and the relatively long charging times compared to filling up a gasoline car. There were no other engine or transmission options available.

**Electric Motor**

**80 kW Electric Motor**

*   **Motor Control Module (MCM) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden loss of power, "turtle" mode activation even with sufficient battery charge, error codes related to the motor control module.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the motor control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Rapid Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of range over time, significantly reduced battery capacity, especially in hot climates. This resulted in many LEAFs not being able to travel far before needing to be charged.
    *   Solution: There is no cost effective solution besides battery replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate state of charge readings, premature charging termination, and error messages related to the battery management system.
    *   Solution: Software update or BMS replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncing, poor handling, and leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    * Solution: Replace the struts and/or shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery draining prematurely, leading to starting issues and system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery and diagnosis of parasitic drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charger Port Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty connecting to charging stations, charging failures, and error messages. This primarily related to the J1772 port.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the charging port or wiring harness repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, unresponsive touchscreen, incorrect GPS location, and software glitches.
    *   Solution: Software update or replacement of the navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent or no heat output, blower motor issues, and temperature control problems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the heater core, blower motor, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2011 Nissan LEAF, while innovative, suffered from some significant issues, particularly related to battery degradation. The rapid loss of battery capacity, especially in hotter climates, severely impacted the vehicle's usability and resale value. Motor Control Module failures and electrical issues also contributed to ownership concerns. Repair costs could range from relatively minor for 12V battery issues to substantial for battery replacement or motor control module repairs, making maintenance potentially expensive.
