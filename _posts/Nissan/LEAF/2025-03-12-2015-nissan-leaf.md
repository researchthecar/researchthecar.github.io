The 2015 Nissan LEAF is a fully electric hatchback known for its affordability and practicality as a commuter car. It has a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery powering an 80 kW (107 hp) electric motor producing 187 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate its low running costs, quiet operation, and zero tailpipe emissions. Common criticisms include limited range, long charging times, and battery degradation over time, impacting range.

**Battery**

* **Battery Capacity Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gradual reduction in battery capacity over time, resulting in decreased driving range. The dashboard displays fewer bars indicating full charge capacity.
    * Solution: Partial battery replacement, full battery replacement, or living with reduced range.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,500 - $9,000+ for full replacement (depending on location and labor). Partial replacement costs can vary significantly.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate state of charge (SOC) readings, early low battery warnings, or complete failure to recognize battery charge level.
    * Solution: BMS software update or BMS module replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the repair needed
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electric Motor**

* **Motor Bearing Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining or grinding noise emanating from the motor, especially noticeable at lower speeds.
    * Solution: Motor bearing replacement or complete motor replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ depending on whether bearings can be replaced or a new motor is required.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Inverter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Complete loss of power, error messages on the dashboard, or inability to charge. The inverter converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the motor.
    * Solution: Inverter replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **12V Battery Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery that powers accessories and starts the car can fail prematurely, leading to issues like the car not starting or accessories not working.
    * Solution: 12V battery replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Charging Port Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty charging, failure to charge, or error messages related to charging. Can affect both Level 1 (120V) and Level 2 (240V) charging.
    * Solution: Charging port replacement or repair. Check the charging cable for damage as well.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Navigation System/Radio Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation system or radio unit may freeze, become unresponsive, or fail completely.
    * Solution: Software update or head unit replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on whether it's a software issue or requires hardware replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Heater Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The heater may not produce heat or may only blow cold air. This is a common issue in electric vehicles, as they rely on electric heaters rather than engine heat.
    * Solution: Heater core replacement, blower motor replacement, or wiring repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Nissan LEAF is a generally reliable EV, but battery degradation is a major concern due to its significant impact on range and the high cost of replacement. Other potential issues include motor noise, inverter failure, and electrical glitches, which can range from moderately expensive to costly, depending on the repair required.
