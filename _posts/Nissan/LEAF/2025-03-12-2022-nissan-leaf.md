The 2022 Nissan LEAF is an all-electric hatchback available in two main configurations: the standard LEAF with a 40 kWh battery and a 110 kW (147 hp) electric motor producing 236 lb-ft of torque, and the LEAF e+ with a larger 62 kWh battery and a more powerful 160 kW (214 hp) electric motor with 250 lb-ft of torque. The LEAF is praised for its affordability, smooth ride, and quiet operation. Criticisms often include its limited range compared to newer EVs, and its CHAdeMO charging port which is becoming less common.

**Electric Motor**

**40 kWh Motor**

* **Reduced Range in Cold Weather**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report a significant reduction in driving range during cold weather conditions. This is due to the battery's chemical processes slowing down in colder temperatures, as well as energy being used for heating the cabin. Reported range drops exceeding 30-40% are not uncommon.
    * Solution: Preheating the cabin while the car is plugged in can help mitigate this issue. Driving conservatively and utilizing the Eco mode can also conserve energy.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Not Applicable
    * Recalls: None Found

**62 kWh Motor**

* **Reduced Range in Cold Weather**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 40 kWh version, owners report a significant reduction in driving range during cold weather conditions.
    * Solution: Preheating the cabin while the car is plugged in can help mitigate this issue. Driving conservatively and utilizing the Eco mode can also conserve energy.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Not Applicable
    * Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

**40 kWh Battery**

* **Premature Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience faster than expected battery degradation, particularly in hot climates. This results in reduced range and increased charging times. Battery capacity can drop below 70% within the warranty period for some users.
    * Solution: Monitoring battery health through the car's information display and using DC fast charging sparingly can help. If degradation is excessive and within the warranty period, Nissan may replace the battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: If under warranty, typically free. Out of warranty replacement can be very costly.
    * Recalls: None Found

**62 kWh Battery**

* **Premature Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 40 kWh version, some owners experience faster than expected battery degradation, especially in hot climates.
    * Solution: Monitoring battery health and limiting DC fast charging can help. Battery replacement under warranty is possible if degradation is excessive.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: If under warranty, typically free. Out of warranty replacement can be very costly.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **12V Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery can drain prematurely, especially if the car is left unused for extended periods. This can result in the car not starting or displaying error messages.
    * Solution: Using a trickle charger to maintain the 12V battery's charge or replacing the battery with a higher-capacity AGM battery can help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Charging Port Issues (CHAdeMO)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the CHAdeMO charging port, including difficulty connecting, slow charging speeds, or complete failure to charge. This can sometimes be due to damage to the port or connector.
    * Solution: Inspect the charging port and connector for damage. Cleaning the contacts can also help. In some cases, the charging port may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Software Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Infotainment system freezes, display errors, and occasional issues with the car's safety systems.
    * Solution: Software updates by Nissan or dealer.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Usually free if under warranty. Otherwise, shop rates apply.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Loose Trim Pieces**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of exterior trim pieces, particularly around the bumpers and side skirts, becoming loose or detaching.
    * Solution: Replacing or reattaching the trim pieces. May require adhesive or new clips.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the piece and repair complexity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Flimsy Interior Materials**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners criticize the quality of the interior materials, particularly the hard plastics used on the dashboard and door panels. These can be prone to scratching and can feel cheap.
    * Solution: No real fix, other than replacing components with aftermarket parts, which is generally not cost-effective.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Not Applicable
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Nissan LEAF can be a reliable and affordable EV, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Battery degradation, especially in hot climates, and electrical issues like 12V battery drain are among the most concerning. The CHAdeMO charging port is also becoming a drawback as charging infrastructure shifts towards CCS. Many of these issues are covered under warranty, but out-of-warranty repairs, particularly for the battery, can be very expensive. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially significant costs, so a thorough inspection and understanding of the warranty coverage are recommended before purchasing a used 2022 LEAF.
