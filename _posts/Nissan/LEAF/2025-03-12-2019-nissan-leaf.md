The 2019 Nissan LEAF is a fully electric hatchback that offers a practical and efficient transportation solution. It comes standard with a 40 kWh battery and an electric motor producing 147 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. A larger 62 kWh battery, dubbed the LEAF Plus, is also available boosting horsepower to 214. Drivers often appreciate the LEAF's quiet operation, smooth acceleration, and the reduced running costs associated with electric vehicle ownership. However, some common complaints include limited range (particularly with the 40 kWh battery), battery degradation over time, and a somewhat basic interior compared to some competitors.

**Battery**

**40 kWh Battery**
* **Premature Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported a significant reduction in battery capacity over time, especially in hot climates. This leads to reduced driving range and increased frequency of charging. The battery capacity bars on the instrument panel decrease faster than expected.
    * Solution: Nissan's warranty covers battery capacity loss below 9 bars (out of 12) within a specific timeframe (e.g., 8 years/100,000 miles). If the battery meets these criteria, it can be replaced under warranty. Otherwise, battery replacement can be explored, but this is very costly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ (out of warranty)
    * Recalls: None Found

**62 kWh Battery**
* **Premature Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners of the LEAF Plus (62 kWh battery) have also reported experiencing premature battery degradation, although perhaps not as frequently as with the 40 kWh version. Symptoms are the same: reduced range and faster-than-expected capacity bar loss.
    * Solution: Similar to the 40 kWh battery, warranty coverage applies if capacity drops below 9 bars within the warranty period. Replacement outside of warranty is expensive.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ (out of warranty)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electric Motor**

**All Models**
* **Motor Control Module Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sudden loss of power, warning lights illuminating on the dashboard, and the car entering "limp mode". Diagnostic codes pointing to the motor control module.
    * Solution: Replacement of the motor control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical System**

**All Models**
* **12V Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, which powers the car's accessories and electronics, can sometimes fail prematurely. Symptoms include difficulty starting the car, even with a fully charged main battery, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Charging Port Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The charging port may fail to recognize the charging cable, or the charging process may be intermittent or fail to complete. Sometimes the port locking mechanism malfunctions.
    * Solution: Replacement of the charging port. Sometimes cleaning and re-seating the connector will solve it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

**All Models**
* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can be prone to freezing, crashing, or becoming unresponsive. The screen may go blank or display error messages.
    * Solution: Software updates may resolve the issue. In some cases, the entire infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the fix)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Heated Seat Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The heated seats may stop working. This can be due to a faulty heating element or a problem with the switch or wiring.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the heating element, switch, or wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**All Models**
* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation and reduced visibility.
    * Solution: Replacement of the headlight assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700 per headlight
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**All Models**
* **Strut Mount Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Creaking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Often caused by worn strut mounts.
    * Solution: Replacement of the front strut mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Nissan LEAF, while a practical EV, has some common issues. The biggest concerns revolve around battery degradation, particularly with the 40 kWh battery pack, which can lead to significant range loss and expensive replacement costs if not covered by the warranty. Electrical system problems, such as 12V battery failures and charging port issues, are also fairly common. Interior and suspension issues are less severe but can still be annoying to deal with. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider getting a pre-purchase inspection, especially focusing on battery health, before making a purchase.
