The 2023 Nissan LEAF is an all-electric hatchback offering a practical and relatively affordable entry into the EV market. It comes in two main configurations: the LEAF and the LEAF PLUS, differing primarily in battery size and range. The standard LEAF features a 40 kWh battery and produces 147 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. The LEAF PLUS boasts a 60 kWh battery and generates 214 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Drivers appreciate the LEAF for its smooth acceleration, quiet operation, and comfortable ride. However, common criticisms include its limited range compared to newer EVs, its aging design, and the CHAdeMO charging port (although it also has a CCS port).

**Electric Motor**

**40 kWh Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Range/Capacity Over Time**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual decrease in battery range over time, especially in hotter climates. Displayed range estimates become inaccurate. Reduced overall battery capacity.
    *   Solution: Battery conditioning can help in some cases. Eventually, battery replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement can range from $5,000 - $10,000+ depending on battery condition and warranty coverage.

**Summary**

The 2023 Nissan LEAF presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. While the electric motor itself is generally reliable, battery degradation and charging issues pose potential concerns. Electrical glitches and interior component failures can also occur. The severity and cost of these issues range from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs. Battery replacements, in particular, represent a significant expense. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's battery health, charging system, and electrical components before purchasing.
