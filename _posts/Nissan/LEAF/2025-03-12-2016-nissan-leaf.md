The 2016 Nissan LEAF is a fully electric hatchback known for its affordability and practicality as an urban commuter. It is powered by an 80 kW AC synchronous electric motor, producing 107 horsepower and 187 lb-ft of torque. A key benefit for owners is the near-silent operation and low running costs due to the absence of gasoline. However, some owners dislike the limited range, which can cause range anxiety, and the long charging times. The LEAF is popular for its eco-friendliness and simple driving experience, but the battery's degradation over time and the basic interior features are common criticisms.

**Electric Motor**

**80 kW AC Synchronous Electric Motor**
* **Premature Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery's capacity diminishes faster than expected, leading to a significant reduction in driving range over time. This is most apparent in hot climates. Reduced mileage on a full charge, sometimes dropping below 70% of the original range within a few years.
    * Solution: There is not one simple solution as the degradation is due to normal wear and tear, though following Nissan's recommendation for battery care will help to reduce the degradation. Owners can replace individual battery modules to increase range, however, replacement of the entire battery pack is sometimes necessary to fully resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ for full battery replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Reduced Power Output**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Motor output gradually decreases over time, with sluggish acceleration and decreased top speed. This is often related to battery health and aging.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to evaluate battery health and motor efficiency, software updates, potential replacement of failing battery modules or the entire battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 for diagnostics and software update; $5,000 - $10,000+ for full battery replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, which powers accessories and starts the car's systems, can fail prematurely. Symptoms include difficulty starting the car, warning lights on the dashboard, and failure of electronic accessories (radio, lights, etc.).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Port Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty charging the vehicle, error messages during charging, or the charging port failing to recognize the charging cable. Can be caused by corrosion, damage, or electrical faults.
    *   Solution: Inspection and cleaning of the charging port. Replacement of the charging port if damaged or faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system may freeze, fail to load maps, or provide incorrect directions.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the navigation system unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software update; $500 - $1,500+ for unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Nissan LEAF is a practical electric vehicle with notable issues, primarily related to battery degradation and electrical components. The premature battery degradation is a significant concern, as it can severely impact the vehicle's range and resale value. The 12V battery and charging port issues are less severe but can still be inconvenient and costly to repair. Overall, while the LEAF offers an affordable entry point into electric vehicles, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs and the impact of battery degradation.
