### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Nissan LEAF, as an early adopter of electric vehicle technology, demonstrates a generally solid mechanical foundation with its electric motor and single-speed transmission proving reliable. The primary areas of concern revolve around its electrical system, particularly the long-term health of the lithium-ion battery pack, which can experience degradation leading to reduced range and significant replacement costs. Issues with the on-board charger and the 12V auxiliary battery are also noted. Interior electronics, such as the infotainment system, can exhibit software glitches. Despite these points, for its time, the LEAF represented a significant step forward in EV reliability, with most non-battery related issues being manageable.
