The 2020 Nissan LEAF is an all-electric hatchback known for its affordability and practicality as an EV. It's powered by either a 40 kWh or a 62 kWh lithium-ion battery, paired with an electric motor. The 40 kWh version delivers 147 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, while the 62 kWh version (LEAF Plus) increases output to 214 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the LEAF's quiet operation and low running costs but sometimes find the range limited compared to newer EVs. Some common complaints relate to battery degradation over time, particularly in warmer climates, and the aging CHAdeMO charging port.

**Battery/Electric Motor**

**40 kWh/62 kWh Electric Motor**
*   **Premature Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced driving range over time, especially in hot climates. The battery capacity bars on the dashboard decrease faster than expected.
    *   Solution: Nissan offered a battery warranty, but replacements are expensive outside of warranty. Some owners have sought aftermarket battery upgrades.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement costs can range from $5,000-$10,000+ depending on the battery pack and installation.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Reduced Charging Speed (CHAdeMO)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CHAdeMO DC fast charging port is aging and lacks the speed and availability of CCS ports used by newer EVs. Charging times can be significantly longer than with CCS-equipped vehicles.
    *   Solution: No direct fix. Owners can utilize Level 2 charging when speed is not critical, or potentially explore aftermarket CHAdeMO to CCS adapter options (though compatibility can be problematic).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Adapter costs can range from $300-$1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, used for auxiliary functions, can drain prematurely, leading to issues starting the car or operating accessories.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery. Investigate potential parasitic draws if the issue persists. Some owners use battery maintainers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters stop working on one or both front seats.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the seat heating element or the seat heater control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
No Issues Found

**Summary:**

The 2020 Nissan LEAF, while a practical EV, has some common issues. The most significant concern is premature battery degradation, which can lead to reduced range and expensive replacements. Electrical issues, such as 12V battery drain and infotainment system problems, can also be frustrating. Interior seat heater failure is a less severe but recurring issue. Owners should be aware of these potential problems when considering purchasing a used 2020 LEAF and factor in the potential costs of repair.
