The 2021 Nissan LEAF is an all-electric hatchback available in two main configurations: the standard LEAF with a 40 kWh battery pack and a 110 kW (147 hp) electric motor producing 236 lb-ft of torque, and the LEAF Plus with a larger 62 kWh battery and a 160 kW (214 hp) electric motor producing 250 lb-ft of torque. The LEAF is generally praised for its affordability, smooth and quiet ride, and practicality as a city car. However, some common criticisms include limited range compared to newer EVs, a somewhat dated interior, and less engaging driving dynamics.

**Electric Motor**

**110 kW Electric Motor (40 kWh Battery)**
*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inverter converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the motor. Failure can cause reduced power, warning lights, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the inverter assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**160 kW Electric Motor (62 kWh Battery)**
*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inverter converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the motor. Failure can cause reduced power, warning lights, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the inverter assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

**40 kWh Battery Pack**
*   **Premature Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience faster than expected battery capacity loss, especially in hot climates. This results in reduced range.
    *   Solution: The battery is covered by an 8 year/100,000 mile warranty for defects and excessive capacity loss (below a certain threshold). If within warranty, replacement or repair may be covered. Otherwise, battery replacement is very expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Warranty Coverage or $5,000 - $10,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**62 kWh Battery Pack**
*   **Premature Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience faster than expected battery capacity loss, especially in hot climates. This results in reduced range.
    *   Solution: The battery is covered by an 8 year/100,000 mile warranty for defects and excessive capacity loss (below a certain threshold). If within warranty, replacement or repair may be covered. Otherwise, battery replacement is very expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Warranty Coverage or $5,000 - $10,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LEAF has a traditional 12V battery that powers auxiliary systems. It can drain prematurely if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods, or if there's a parasitic draw. Symptoms include difficulty starting (though it's an EV), warning lights, and malfunction of accessories.
    *   Solution: Jump-start or replace the 12V battery. Identify and correct any parasitic draws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Charging Port Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the charging port failing to lock properly, or failing to release the charging cable. This can prevent the vehicle from charging or make it difficult to disconnect the charger.
    * Solution: Inspection and repair or replacement of the charging port assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent freezing, reboots, and unresponsive touchscreens reported. Software updates may help.
    *   Solution: Software update or replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (if available and covered) or $500 - $2,000+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per headlight.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattles from the dashboard or door panels, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating and securing the source of the rattle (loose trim, wiring, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the severity and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Nissan LEAF, while a competent and affordable EV, can suffer from inverter failure which can be costly to repair or replace. Potential battery degradation is a major concern, as replacement costs are high outside of warranty. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the 12V battery, charging port, and infotainment system, are also potential issues. While minor interior rattles are common, more significant issues like inverter failure and battery degradation require prompt attention.
