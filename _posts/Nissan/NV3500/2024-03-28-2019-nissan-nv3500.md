**Introduction:**

The 2019 Nissan NV3500 is a versatile full-size cargo van available in several configurations and trim levels. It offers a choice of engines and transmissions, including a V6 gasoline engine with a 5-speed automatic transmission and a turbocharged V8 diesel engine with a 7-speed automatic transmission. The NV3500 is known for its spacious cargo area, robust build quality, and powerful engines. While it received positive reviews for these aspects, some owners have reported specific issues with their vehicles.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 Gasoline Engine**

* **Intake Valve Carbon Buildup:** Carbon deposits can accumulate on the intake valves, causing a loss of power and increased fuel consumption. Cleaning the valves usually resolves the issue.
* **Fuel Injector Failure:** Faulty fuel injectors can lead to engine misfires, rough idling, and decreased performance. Replacing the affected injectors is the solution.

**5.0L V8 Turbo Diesel Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** Turbocharger malfunction can result in reduced engine power, smoke from the exhaust, and increased oil consumption. Repair or replacement of the turbocharger is necessary.
* **EGR Valve Problems:** The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged or malfunction, leading to reduced engine performance and increased emissions. The valve needs to be replaced or cleaned.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shifting Issues:** Some owners have experienced rough shifting or delayed shifts, particularly when changing from Park to Drive. Software updates or transmission servicing can often resolve the problem.

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Slipping:** In some cases, the transmission may slip, causing a loss of power or the inability to shift gears. Repair or replacement of the transmission may be necessary.

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging:** Over time, the leaf springs in the rear suspension can sag, leading to a lower ride height and reduced load-carrying capacity. Replacing the leaf springs resolves the issue.
* **Shock Absorber Wear:** Worn shock absorbers can result in a rough ride and reduced handling capabilities. Replacing the shock absorbers is the solution.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** A parasitic draw on the battery can cause premature discharge, even when the vehicle is parked. Identifying and устранение the source of the drain is necessary.
* **Alternator Failure:** A faulty alternator can fail to generate sufficient power for the vehicle's electrical systems. Replacing the alternator solves the problem.

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Undercarriage:** Some owners have reported premature rusting on the undercarriage components, particularly in areas exposed to salt or moisture. Rust prevention treatments can help mitigate this issue.
* **Tailgate Corrosion:** The tailgate can sometimes develop corrosion, especially at the hinges or latch. Sanding, repainting, or replacing the affected parts is the solution.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Rattling:** Some models may experience dashboard rattles or vibrations, particularly on rough roads. Identifying and tightening loose components can resolve the issue.
* **HVAC System Malfunction:** Occasional problems have been reported with the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, including poor airflow or temperature control issues. Repair or replacement of the affected components is necessary.

**Summary**

The 2019 Nissan NV3500 has received generally positive reviews, but some owners have encountered specific issues with their vehicles. The severity of the issues varies, ranging from minor inconveniences (such as dashboard rattling) to more serious problems (like engine or transmission failures). The cost of repairs can also vary significantly depending on the nature of the issue. Overall, the NV3500 is a capable and reliable cargo van, but potential buyers should be aware of the potential issues before making a purchase decision.
