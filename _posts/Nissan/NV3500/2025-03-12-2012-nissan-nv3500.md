The 2012 Nissan NV3500 is a full-size commercial van offering a robust platform for various business needs. It came with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing around 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.6L V8 generating approximately 317 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the NV3500 for its spacious cargo area, comfortable front seats, and strong towing capability. However, some criticisms include its fuel economy, somewhat dated interior, and relatively limited availability of advanced driver-assistance features compared to newer competitors.

**Summary**

The 2012 Nissan NV3500, while a capable work van, has several known issues. The engine problems, particularly with timing chains on the V6 and oil consumption on the V8, can be costly to address. Transmission issues can also be significant. Suspension problems and electrical gremlins add to the potential ownership costs. While some issues are minor, others could lead to substantial repair bills, making it crucial to thoroughly inspect a used NV3500 before purchasing.
