The 2020 Nissan NV3500 is a full-size cargo van known for its robust build and spacious interior, catering to businesses needing a reliable work vehicle. Engine options included a 4.0L V6 and a 5.6L V8, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission for the V6 and a 7-speed automatic transmission for the V8. The 5.6L V8 produces 375 horsepower and 387 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise its payload capacity and overall functionality, but some dislike its fuel economy and somewhat dated interior.

**Engine**

**5.6L V8**

*   **Timing Chain Guide Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the timing chain guides wearing prematurely, leading to a rattling noise upon startup, especially when the engine is cold. Left unaddressed, this can lead to timing chain failure and significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption is possible. Owners report needing to add oil between changes. This can be caused by worn valve seals, piston rings, or issues with the PCV system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of oil consumption. Replacing valve seals or piston rings are possible fixes, but may require engine removal or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.0L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (Paired with 5.6L V8)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted issues with the torque converter not locking up properly, leading to poor fuel economy, shuddering during acceleration, or even complete failure of the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, transmission replacement may be necessary if damage has occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on if only the torque converter is replaced or the entire transmission
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (Paired with 4.0L V6)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Especially on vehicles that frequently carry heavy loads, the rear leaf springs can sag prematurely, leading to reduced load capacity, poor ride quality, and potential bottoming out. In more severe cases, a leaf spring can break.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty leaf springs can prevent future issues if the vehicle regularly carries heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with unexplained battery drain, often traced to parasitic draws from aftermarket accessories or faulty modules. This can lead to a dead battery, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly diagnose the electrical system to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Possible fixes include replacing faulty modules, disconnecting or repairing aftermarket accessories, or addressing wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the source of the draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various sensors such as ABS, TPMS, and O2 sensors can fail prematurely. Symptoms vary depending on the affected sensor but often include warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor failure and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, depending on the location and type of sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Mechanism Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced problems with the sliding door mechanism, including difficulty opening or closing the door, unusual noises, or complete failure of the power sliding door (if equipped).
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the issue, which may involve lubricating the tracks, replacing worn rollers or cables, or replacing the entire sliding door mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Nissan NV3500, while a capable work van, has reported issues, particularly with the 5.6L V8 engine and its associated 7-speed transmission. Timing chain issues, oil consumption, and torque converter problems appear to be the most significant concerns. Suspension problems such as leaf spring sagging can also occur. Electrical issues such as battery drain and sensor failures can also occur. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission repairs. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant expenses and downtime, making it crucial for potential buyers to thoroughly inspect the vehicle and review its maintenance history.
