The gasoline engine is a 5.6-liter V8 producing 317 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque, while the diesel engine is a 5.0-liter V8 producing 310 horsepower and 555 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. The NV3500 is known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engines. However, it has also been criticized for its poor fuel economy and outdated interior.
