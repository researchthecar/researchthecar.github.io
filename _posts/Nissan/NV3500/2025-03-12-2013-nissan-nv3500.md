The 2013 Nissan NV3500 is a full-size cargo van known for its spacious interior, strong towing capacity, and truck-like durability.

Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the van's ample cargo space and robust build quality. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, ride quality, and certain electrical issues.
