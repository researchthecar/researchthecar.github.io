The 2018 Nissan NV3500, while a capable work van, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The engine issues, particularly timing chain issues in the 4.0L V6 and oil leaks in the 5.6L V8, can be relatively expensive to repair. Transmission problems and suspension issues, such as sagging leaf springs, also contribute to potential maintenance costs. While some issues are minor, others could lead to significant repair bills. Overall, the NV3500 is prone to medium-to-high cost issues, especially as the vehicle ages.
