The 2014 Nissan Rogue Select is a compact SUV offering a budget-friendly option in the Rogue lineup, essentially a rebadged version of the previous generation Rogue. It comes exclusively with a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine (QR25DE) producing approximately 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate its fuel efficiency and affordability, but common complaints include the CVT's reliability and overall dated design compared to newer models.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, sometimes needing a quart or more between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored and addressed. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust pipe is a common symptom.
    *   Solution: The issue is often caused by worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the root cause. Depending on the severity, the solution can range from using a higher-viscosity oil and regularly checking oil levels to replacing the piston rings, valve stem seals, or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter can fail prematurely, leading to a check engine light and poor performance. This is sometimes linked to the excessive oil consumption issue, as oil entering the exhaust system can damage the converter.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is a common source of complaints. Symptoms include jerking, shuddering, slipping, delayed engagement, and complete transmission failure. This can be caused by a faulty valve body or internal wear and tear of the belt and pulleys.
    *   Solution: A software update might temporarily improve the performance of the CVT, but often the transmission requires replacement or a complete rebuild. Flushing the CVT fluid regularly at recommended intervals can sometimes help extend its life.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (for replacement or rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Often caused by worn sway bar bushings, end links, or shocks/struts. Replacement of these components is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain causing starting issues. Can be caused by parasitic draw from various electrical components or a faulty alternator not properly charging the battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and eliminate any parasitic draws. Replace the battery or alternator if found to be faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the cause and components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting of Rear Hatch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rust forming along the seams and edges of the rear hatch/liftgate.
    *   Solution: Repairing and repainting the affected areas or replacing the entire hatch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the rust and chosen repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Warning Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminating on the dashboard. This could indicate a problem with the airbag sensors, wiring, or the airbag control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the airbag system by a qualified technician. This may involve replacing sensors, repairing wiring, or replacing the airbag control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the problem and parts required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan Rogue Select has some notable issues, with the most concerning being related to the CVT transmission and engine oil consumption. CVT failures can be costly to repair or replace, and excessive oil consumption can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed. Other issues, such as suspension noises and electrical problems, are generally less severe but still require attention. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase, paying particular attention to the condition of the transmission and engine.
