The 2015 Nissan Rogue Select is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It came with only one engine option: a 2.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. It was only available with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Rogue Select for its comfortable ride and spacious interior, but some common complaints include concerns about the reliability of the CVT transmission and some reported electrical issues.
