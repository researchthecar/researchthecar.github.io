The 2012 Nissan Quest is a minivan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and distinctive styling. It came equipped with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 260 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Quest's smooth ride, comfortable seating, and ample cargo space. Criticisms often revolve around the van's somewhat bland driving experience, perceived cheap interior materials, and reliability concerns.
