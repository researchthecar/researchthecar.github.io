**Summary**
The 2009 Nissan Quest, while offering practicality, exhibits several reliability concerns. Transmission issues are a major concern, potentially leading to costly repairs. Electrical problems, particularly with the sliding doors and windows, are also frequently reported. Oil consumption in the engine is also an issue that can arise. While less severe, suspension and interior issues like dashboard cracking contribute to overall owner dissatisfaction. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs.
