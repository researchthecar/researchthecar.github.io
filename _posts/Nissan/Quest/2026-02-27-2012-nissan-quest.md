## Engine

### 3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)
**Oil Leaks (Valve Covers/Oil Pan)**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level.
- **Solution:** Replacement of valve cover gaskets or oil pan gasket.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise from the engine on startup, check engine light, rough idle.
- **Solution:** Replacement of VVT actuators and potentially timing chain components.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500


## Transmission

### CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)
**Hesitation and Shuddering**
- **Symptoms:** Jerking or shuddering during acceleration, delayed engagement, transmission warning light.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement, or in severe cases, transmission rebuild or replacement.
- **Cost:** $500 - $3000+

**Overheating**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission fluid smell, reduced performance, transmission warning light.
- **Solution:** Inspection and potential repair or replacement of transmission cooler.
- **Cost:** $400 - $900


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Strut Mount Bearing Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Popping or clunking noise when turning the steering wheel, especially at low speeds.
- **Solution:** Replacement of strut mount bearings.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Power Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Various electrical components (lights, power windows, radio) malfunctioning or failing intermittently.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000


### Infotainment System
**Screen Freezing/Unresponsiveness**
- **Symptoms:** Touchscreen becomes unresponsive, system freezes or reboots randomly.
- **Solution:** Software update or replacement of the infotainment unit.
- **Cost:** $300 - $800


## Exterior

### Power Sliding Doors
**Malfunctioning Motors/Sensors**
- **Symptoms:** Doors fail to open or close, operate slowly, or stop mid-operation.
- **Solution:** Replacement of door motors, sensors, or control modules.
- **Cost:** $400 - $900 per door


## Interior

### HVAC Blower Motor
**Blower Motor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** No air coming from vents or intermittent airflow, regardless of fan speed setting.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the HVAC blower motor.
- **Cost:** $250 - $500

### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Nissan Quest's reliability is a mixed concern. The 3.5L V6 engine is generally robust but can suffer from oil leaks and VVT actuator issues. The CVT transmission is a more frequent source of problems, with reports of hesitation, shuddering, and overheating, often leading to costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and infotainment system, can also arise. Exterior power sliding doors and interior HVAC blower motors are other areas where owners may encounter issues. While not universally problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these common technical weaknesses and factor in potential repair costs.
