### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Nissan Quest is a practical minivan with a capable V6 engine, but it is not without its common issues. The most significant concerns tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly the CVT transmission's susceptibility to overheating and fluid degradation, and potential leaks from the engine's oil cooler lines and intake manifold gaskets. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM and instrument cluster failures, can also be a source of frustration. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, and wear on interior components are also points to consider. While many of these issues are repairable, they can add to the overall cost of ownership. Regular maintenance, especially for the transmission fluid, is crucial for longevity.
