The 2002 Nissan Quest is a minivan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior, making it a popular choice for families. The sole engine option is a 3.3L VG33E V6 engine producing around 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Quest's reliability and practicality, but common complaints revolve around issues with the transmission, electrical components, and some engine-related problems. Some dislike the somewhat bland styling and handling compared to other minivans.
