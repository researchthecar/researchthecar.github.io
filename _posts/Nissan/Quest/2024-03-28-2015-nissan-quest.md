**Summary**

The 2015 Nissan Quest has been praised for its spacious interior, comfortable seating, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some owners have reported issues with the engine (intake manifold gasket leak, timing chain noise), transmission (CVT shudder, premature wear), suspension (noise), electrical (battery drain), exterior (tailgate latch failure), and interior (dashboard rattling). The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some requiring only minor repairs while others may be more expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
