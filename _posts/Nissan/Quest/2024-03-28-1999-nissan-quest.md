**Introduction to the 1999 Nissan Quest**

The 1999 Nissan Quest is a minivan that offers a spacious cabin, comfortable ride, and impressive fuel economy. It is available with two engine options: a 3.3-liter V6 rated at 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 rated at 240 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Quest is praised for its roomy interior, smooth ride quality, and fuel-efficient performance. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of power, particularly with the 3.3-liter engine.

**Engine**

* **3.3-liter V6**
    * **Valve cover gasket leak:** Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, causing oil consumption and potential engine damage.
    * **Intake manifold gasket leak:** Coolant leaks from the intake manifold gaskets, leading to overheating and potential engine damage.
    * **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner fails, causing the timing chain to skip and potentially leading to engine damage.
    * **Oxygen sensor failure:** The oxygen sensor fails, affecting fuel-air mixture and causing poor engine performance.
* **3.5-liter V6**
    * **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

* **4-speed Automatic**
    * **Transmission slippage:** The transmission slips gears, causing rough shifting and loss of power.
    * **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter shudders when the transmission shifts gears, causing vibrations and noise.
    * **Solenoid failure:** The transmission solenoids fail, preventing the transmission from shifting properly.

**Suspension**

* **Front struts:** The front struts wear out prematurely, causing excessive body roll and poor handling.
* **Rear shocks:** The rear shocks leak fluid and lose damping ability, resulting in a rough ride and poor handling.
* **Control arm bushings:** The control arm bushings wear out, causing clunking noises and poor alignment.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator fails, causing the battery to drain and the vehicle to lose power.
* **Starter failure:** The starter fails, preventing the engine from starting.
* **Battery drain:** A parasitic drain on the battery causes it to discharge prematurely.
* **Ignition coil failure:** The ignition coil fails, causing misfires and poor engine performance.

**Exterior**

* **Power sliding door failure:** The power sliding door fails to open or close properly, making it difficult to access the vehicle.
* **Rear wiper motor failure:** The rear wiper motor fails, preventing the rear window from being cleared of debris.

**Interior**

* **Climate control system failure:** The climate control system fails to regulate temperature, causing discomfort for passengers.
* **Cruise control failure:** The cruise control system fails to engage or maintain speed, making it difficult to maintain a steady pace.

**Summary**

The 1999 Nissan Quest is a generally reliable vehicle with some potential issues. The most common engine issues affect the 3.3-liter V6, while the 3.5-liter V6 has a better track record. The transmission can experience some problems, particularly with the 4-speed automatic. The other components, including the suspension, electrical system, and interior, generally have fewer issues. Overall, the severity of the issues is moderate, and the cost to fix them ranges from relatively low to moderately high.
