**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and use of a higher viscosity oil may help. In severe cases, engine repair or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5,000+

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. This can lead to more serious engine damage if the chain jumps a tooth.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when accelerating, difficulty shifting gears, or harsh engagement of gears. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn clutches, or a faulty valve body.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue if it's due to dirty fluid. If the problem persists, the valve body might need to be rebuilt or replaced, or the entire transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,500+ (transmission replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded with passengers or cargo. This can be due to worn-out rear springs or shocks.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800

**Electrical**

*   **Sliding Door Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sliding doors that fail to open or close properly, or that only work intermittently. This can be caused by a faulty motor, wiring issues, or a problem with the door latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause of the problem and replacing the faulty component. This could involve replacing the motor, repairing the wiring, or replacing the latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, or operating intermittently. This can be caused by a faulty window motor, a problem with the wiring, or a broken window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window motor, repairing the wiring, or replacing the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
