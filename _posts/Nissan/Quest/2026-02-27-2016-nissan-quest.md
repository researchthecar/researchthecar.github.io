### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Nissan Quest offers a practical and spacious interior, making it a suitable choice for families. Its primary powertrain, the 3.5L V6, is generally reliable but can experience issues with the Variable Valve Timing system and oil leaks, particularly as mileage increases. The CVT transmission, while common in Nissan vehicles, has been associated with hesitation, shuddering, and overheating, which can lead to costly repairs. Suspension components like struts and shocks may require replacement due to wear and tear. Electrical concerns are mainly centered around the infotainment system's responsiveness and the reliable operation of the power sliding doors. Overall, while not plagued by widespread critical failures, potential buyers should be aware of the transmission and VVT system as key areas to inspect.
