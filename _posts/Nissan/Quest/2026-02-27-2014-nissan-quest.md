### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Nissan Quest generally presents a reliable profile, with its V6 engine being a strong point. The primary areas of concern tend to be the CVT transmission, which can exhibit hesitation or overheating issues requiring attention, and certain electrical components like the Body Control Module and infotainment system, which may experience glitches. Exterior components like power sliding doors can also require maintenance. Interior wear on seats is not uncommon for a vehicle of this age and usage. Overall, while not immune to issues, the Quest offers a decent ownership experience if potential transmission and electrical quirks are addressed proactively.
