The 2017 Nissan Quest is a minivan powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 260 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Quest's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available features, but some dislike its bland styling, lower fuel economy compared to competitors, and CVT transmission performance. Common criticisms focus on electrical problems, CVT transmission reliability, and some interior quality issues.
