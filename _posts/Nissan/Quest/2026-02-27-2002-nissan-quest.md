### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Nissan Quest presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.3L V6 engine is generally robust but can suffer from intake manifold leaks and camshaft sensor issues. The automatic transmission is a common point of concern, with slipping and hesitation being reported, often requiring significant repair. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are typical wear items that may need replacement. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, can also arise. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates, and interior wear, especially on seats, is common. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, owners should budget for potential repairs related to the transmission, electrical system, and common wear items.
