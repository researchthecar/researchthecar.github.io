Owners often appreciate its compact size and practicality, while common complaints revolve around ride quality and limited cabin space.

**Engine**

**YD25DDTi 2.5L Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, white smoke from the exhaust, poor fuel economy, and eventual engine misfire. Often caused by contaminated fuel damaging the injector internals.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty injectors. It's recommended to replace all injectors at once to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. If ignored, can lead to serious engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, sprockets, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**ZD30DDTi 3.0L Diesel**

*   **Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine temperature rises rapidly, often accompanied by steam or coolant leaks. Can lead to head gasket failure or engine damage.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair the cooling system, including the radiator, water pump, thermostat, and hoses. Check for head gasket leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, black smoke from the exhaust, and a whining noise from the turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Manual Transmission**

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting into certain gears, grinding noise during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn synchronizers, and potentially other damaged components within the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Automated Manual Transmission (AMT)**

*   **Clutch Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, jerky gear changes, or complete inability to engage gears. The AMT system relies on actuators to control the clutch and gear selection.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty clutch actuator. This may also require reprogramming the transmission control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced load-carrying capacity, uneven ride height, and poor handling. Common in vehicles frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if the vehicle is often used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll, and increased braking distance.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shocks/struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Glow Plugs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather, rough idling, and excessive smoke during startup.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty glow plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard, difficulty starting the engine, and eventually a complete loss of electrical power.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting of Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on body panels, especially in areas prone to moisture and salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the affected body panels, followed by rustproofing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Nissan Cabstar, while a practical and versatile vehicle, exhibits common issues related to its diesel engines, particularly the YD25DDTi and ZD30DDTi, with injector failure, timing chain issues, overheating and turbocharger failures being prominent. Transmission problems related to synchronizer wear in the manual transmission and clutch actuator failure with the automated manual transmission are also noted. Suspension and electrical issues like sagging leaf springs, worn shocks/struts, glow plug and alternator failures add to the potential maintenance costs. Exterior rust and dashboard cracking further contribute to the overall ownership experience. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major repairs, with repair costs varying widely depending on the specific problem and its extent. While some issues, like rust, can be addressed preventatively, others, such as injector failure, may require more costly interventions.
