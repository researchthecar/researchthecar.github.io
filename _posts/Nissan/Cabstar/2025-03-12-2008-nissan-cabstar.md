The 2008 Nissan Cabstar is a versatile light commercial vehicle known for its maneuverability and reliability, particularly in urban environments. It was offered with several engine options, including diesel engines ranging from 2.5L to 3.0L displacements. One common engine is the YD25DDTi 2.5L diesel engine, producing around 110 - 130 horsepower and 184-221 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific variant. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual. Owners often praise the Cabstar for its tight turning radius and payload capacity, while some common complaints involve engine reliability and electrical gremlins.
