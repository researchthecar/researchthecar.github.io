The 2009 Nissan Cabstar, also known as the Nissan Atlas in some markets, is a light-duty commercial vehicle known for its utility and maneuverability. Available engine options typically include a range of diesel engines, such as the 2.5L and 3.0L diesels. The 2.5L diesel produces around 110 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque depending on the exact specification, while the 3.0L version yields approximately 130 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options generally include a 5-speed manual and sometimes an automatic. Owners often appreciate the Cabstar's compact size for navigating tight city streets and its robust build for hauling goods. However, some common complaints revolve around the relatively basic interior and potential for rust in certain climates.

**Summary**

The 2009 Nissan Cabstar is a practical commercial vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly related to injectors, turbos, EGR valves, and fuel pumps on the diesel models, can be costly. Suspension issues, specifically leaf spring problems, are also common due to the vehicle's workhorse nature. Electrical problems, mainly wiring harness and alternator issues, along with rust, particularly in harsher climates, can also add to the ownership costs. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be significant and expensive to repair. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and check its service history before purchasing.
