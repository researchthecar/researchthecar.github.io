The 2016 Nissan Cabstar is a light-duty truck known for its maneuverability and utility in urban environments. It was often equipped with a 2.5-liter inline-four diesel engine, producing approximately 130-150 horsepower and 250-270 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific variant. Other engine options available included a 3.0-liter diesel engine. Transmission options typically consisted of a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate its compact size and turning radius, making it easy to navigate tight spaces. However, some common complaints revolve around its relatively basic interior, ride comfort, and engine noise.

**Engine**

**2.5L Diesel Engine**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, rough idling, reduced power, black smoke from exhaust, and potential engine misfires. Can be caused by contaminated fuel or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at once to ensure balanced performance. Fuel system cleaning might also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, loss of power, increased oil consumption, and potentially black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for damage or excessive play. Replace the turbocharger assembly. Check oil supply lines to the turbocharger for blockage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Diesel Engine**

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light illuminated. Carbon buildup can cause the EGR valve to stick open or closed.
    * Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. Check and clean the EGR passages.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, clutch pedal sticking, and unusual noises coming from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. Consider resurfacing or replacing the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Specific Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding noise when shifting into certain gears, particularly 2nd and 3rd. Difficulty engaging gears, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Inspect and adjust the shift linkage. Check the transmission fluid level and condition. In some cases, internal damage to the synchros may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (linkage adjustment) to $1500 - $3000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Slipping Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revs higher than normal without corresponding acceleration. Hesitation or jerking during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If slipping persists, internal damage such as worn clutch packs may necessitate a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush) to $2000 - $4000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and steering response. Uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Inspect all suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.). Replace any worn or damaged bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of bushings replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower on one side or in the rear. Reduced load carrying capacity. Squeaking noises from the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Inspect leaf springs for cracks or excessive sagging. Replace leaf springs as needed. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty leaf springs if the vehicle is frequently used for hauling heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (per leaf spring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty ABS Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS warning light illuminated on the dashboard. ABS system not functioning properly during braking.
    *   Solution: Diagnose which ABS sensor is faulty using a scan tool. Replace the faulty ABS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, gauges not working, or starting problems. Corrosion or damage to wiring harnesses can cause shorts or open circuits.
    *   Solution: Inspect wiring harnesses for damage, corrosion, or loose connections. Repair or replace damaged wiring harnesses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the severity of the damage and the extent of the repair)

**Summary**

The 2016 Nissan Cabstar, while a useful work vehicle, appears to have several potential issues owners should be aware of. The engine and transmission, particularly the diesel variants and manual transmission options, are prone to failures that can lead to significant repair costs. Issues with the suspension, electrical components, and rust are also concerns. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with estimated repair costs varying from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. It's crucial to thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing and maintain a regular maintenance schedule to mitigate these potential problems.
