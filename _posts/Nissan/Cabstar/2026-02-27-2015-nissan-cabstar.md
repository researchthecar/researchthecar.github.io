### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Nissan Cabstar demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core mechanical and structural components. The diesel engines, while generally robust, are susceptible to issues common with modern emissions systems like DPF clogging and EGR valve problems, especially if used for short urban journeys. Turbocharger issues can also arise. The manual transmissions are typically durable, with clutch wear being the most common concern. Electrical gremlins, such as alternator failure or wiring harness issues, are not uncommon but are generally repairable. The exterior and interior components are built for commercial use and tend to be less problematic. For owners who perform regular maintenance and appropriate driving cycles for diesel engines, the Cabstar should provide reliable service.
