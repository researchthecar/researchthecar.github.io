The 2013 Nissan Cabstar is a light-duty truck known for its versatility and practicality in urban environments. It's available with a range of diesel engine options. The most common is the 2.5L YD25DDTi inline-4 diesel engine, producing around 110-130 horsepower and 250-300 Nm of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Other diesel engine options available were the 3.0L ZD30 inline-4 diesel engine. These engines are typically paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, depending on the market and specific model. Owners often appreciate the Cabstar's maneuverability and compact size, making it ideal for navigating tight city streets. However, some dislike its relatively basic interior and limited payload capacity compared to larger trucks.
