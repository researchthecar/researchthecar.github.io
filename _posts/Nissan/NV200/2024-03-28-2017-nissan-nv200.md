**Introduction**

The 2017 Nissan NV200 is a compact cargo van that prioritizes functionality over frills. It features a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine and Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Known for its versatility and fuel efficiency, the NV200 caters primarily to small businesses and fleet operators. While praised for its practical design, some owners have encountered issues with the vehicle's reliability and performance.

**Engine**

* **2.0L Inline-4**

  * **Intake Manifold Clogged:** Buildup of carbon deposits restricts airflow, causing loss of power, rough idling, and increased fuel consumption. **Solution:** Clean or replace intake manifold. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
  * **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** Worn or defective tensioner allows the timing chain to slip, resulting in engine misfires, rattling noises, and potential engine damage. **Solution:** Replace timing chain tensioner. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $2,000+
  * **Oil Leak from Oil Pressure Switch:** Faulty oil pressure switch seal causes oil to leak, potentially leading to engine damage. **Solution:** Replace oil pressure switch. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $200
  * **EGR Valve Failure:** Clogged or malfunctioning valve restricts exhaust gas recirculation, reducing fuel efficiency and increasing emissions. **Solution:** Replace EGR valve. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $800
  * **Piston Ring Failure:** Worn or broken piston rings lead to increased oil consumption, smoking from the exhaust, and loss of power. **Solution:** Overhaul or replace engine. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $3,000 - $5,000+

**Transmission**

* **Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

  * **Transmission Slippage:** Belt or pulley slippage causes loss of power, shuddering, and poor acceleration. **Solution:** Replace CVT belt or pulley. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,000 - $3,000+
  * **Transmission Failure:** Internal component failure leads to complete loss of power. **Solution:** Replace transmission. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $4,000 - $6,000+
  * **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** Worn seals or gaskets cause transmission fluid to leak, potentially leading to transmission damage. **Solution:** Replace seals or gaskets. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500

**Suspension**

* No Issues Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Faulty alternator, battery, or electrical component drains the battery, leaving the vehicle unable to start. **Solution:** Replace faulty component. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $800
* **Wiring Harness Issues:** Frayed or damaged wiring harness causes electrical malfunctions, including power loss to various components. **Solution:** Repair or replace wiring harness. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+
* **Fuse Box Overheating:** Overloaded or malfunctioning fuses can cause the fuse box to overheat, potentially leading to an electrical fire. **Solution:** Replace fuses and diagnose electrical system. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $500

**Exterior**

* **Rear Bumper Cover Sagging:** Loose bolts or weak bumper material causes the bumper cover to sag or detach. **Solution:** Tighten or replace bumper cover bolts. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $300
* **Door Handle Failure:** Broken or frozen door handle mechanisms prevent door opening. **Solution:** Replace door handle assembly. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure:** Faulty blower motor or resistor prevents heating or air conditioning from working. **Solution:** Replace blower motor or resistor. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400
* **Radio Display Failure:** Malfunctioning display screen or software glitches cause the radio to become inoperable. **Solution:** Repair or replace radio display. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $600
* **Seat Upholstery Ripping:** Poor quality seat fabric tears or rips easily. **Solution:** Repair or replace seat upholstery. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500

**Summary**

While the 2017 Nissan NV200 offers practicality and fuel efficiency, it has faced its fair share of reliability issues. The engine is prone to serious problems, such as timing chain tensioner failure and piston ring failure, which can lead to costly repairs. The CVT transmission has also been known to fail, resulting in complete loss of power. The electrical system and interior components have also had their fair share of issues, including wiring harness problems and HVAC blower motor failure. Overall, the reliability concerns associated with the 2017 Nissan NV200 make it a less desirable choice for those seeking a dependable commercial van.
