The 2020 Nissan NV200 is a compact cargo van known for its practicality, maneuverability, and fuel efficiency. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 131 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate the NV200's compact size for navigating city streets and its ample cargo space for its class. Common complaints include the van's relatively low power output, basic interior features, and limited driver assistance technology compared to newer competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and timely oil changes using the manufacturer-recommended oil viscosity. In more severe cases, a mechanic may need to perform a compression test or leak-down test to diagnose the source of the consumption, which could involve piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the cause and severity).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates with codes indicating catalytic converter inefficiency (e.g., P0420). Decreased fuel economy and a sulfur smell may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report CVT failure at relatively low mileages. Symptoms include slipping, jerking, hesitation during acceleration, and the inability to maintain speed. This is a known weakness in some Nissan CVT transmissions.
    *   Solution: The common solution is a complete CVT replacement. In some cases, a rebuild might be possible, but replacement is often recommended for reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported the front struts wearing out prematurely, leading to a bouncy ride, excessive body roll in turns, and potentially unusual tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when left parked for extended periods. This can prevent the van from starting.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of parasitic draw, which might involve testing the charging system, checking for aftermarket accessories, or replacing the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks may fail to operate reliably, with some doors not locking or unlocking consistently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected door lock actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulties opening or closing the sliding doors, often due to issues with the door latch or alignment.
    *   Solution: Adjustment of the door alignment and lubrication of the latch mechanism. In some cases, replacement of the latch or other door hardware may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blows warm air, indicating a potential issue with the compressor, refrigerant leak, or other A/C components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the A/C system to identify the cause of the failure. This may involve recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, or repairing leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Nissan NV200 is a practical van with a few common issues. The most concerning is the potential for CVT failure, which can be a costly repair. Other issues, such as excessive oil consumption, battery drain, and A/C problems, are less severe but should be addressed promptly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
