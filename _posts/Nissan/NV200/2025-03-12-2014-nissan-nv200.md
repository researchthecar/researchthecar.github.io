The 2014 Nissan NV200 is a compact cargo van designed for small businesses and urban environments. It was only available with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 131 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque, paired with a CVT transmission. Owners often praise its fuel efficiency, maneuverability, and cargo space relative to its size. Common complaints include the underpowered engine, basic interior, and limited technology features.

**Engine**

**2.0L I4 (HR20DE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms can include low oil level warning lights and, in severe cases, engine knocking or damage.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks are essential. If consumption is high, a mechanic should inspect for leaks, PCV valve issues, or internal engine damage. Replacing piston rings may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the cause and extent of the repairs)

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail prematurely, leading to a check engine light (typically a P0420 code). Symptoms can also include reduced engine performance and fuel efficiency.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is a known weak point, with some owners experiencing premature failures. Symptoms include slipping, hesitation, jerky acceleration, and whining noises.
    *   Solution: In many cases, the only solution is to replace the CVT transmission. Some shops may attempt a rebuild, but the long-term reliability of rebuilt CVTs can be questionable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience torque converter issues, leading to shuddering or vibrations during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front struts/shocks may wear out faster than expected, leading to a bouncy ride and diminished handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery failing prematurely or not holding a charge.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery. Ensure the replacement battery meets the vehicle's specifications.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300

*   **Sliding Door Wiring Harness Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The wiring harness that runs to the sliding doors can fail, causing issues with the power locks, power windows (if equipped), and interior lights in the rear.
    * Solution: Replacing the wiring harness.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Roller Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding door rollers can wear down or break, making the door difficult to open and close smoothly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the sliding door rollers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (per door)

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan NV200, while appreciated for its practicality, has some notable issues, especially with the CVT transmission and potential engine oil consumption. These repairs can be expensive. Owners should be aware of these potential problems and budget accordingly. Other issues like suspension and electrical glitches, while less frequent, contribute to the overall ownership experience. The sliding door wiring harness is another point of concern.
