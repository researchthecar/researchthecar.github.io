**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, the need to add oil regularly, and potentially visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The solution can range from using a higher viscosity oil to replacing piston rings or valve seals. A compression test can help determine the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail, causing the check engine light to illuminate and the vehicle to fail emissions tests. Symptoms can include reduced engine performance and a sulfur-like smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

**Summary**

The 2018 Nissan NV200 presents a mixed bag of potential issues. The most concerning are the potential for CVT transmission failure and excessive oil consumption, both of which can be expensive to repair. Suspension issues, electrical glitches, and sliding door problems are also reported, though generally less severe. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle, including the transmission, during a pre-purchase inspection.
