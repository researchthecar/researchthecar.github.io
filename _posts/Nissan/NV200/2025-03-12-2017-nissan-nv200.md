**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the 2.0L engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be indicated by low oil levels, the oil light illuminating, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address any leaks promptly. If oil consumption is excessive, consider having a mechanic perform a compression test and leak-down test to diagnose potential issues like worn piston rings or valve seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: The cost varies greatly depending on the root cause, but repairs can range from $100 (for leak repairs) to $1,500 - $4,000+ (for engine rebuild or replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**

* **CVT Failure/Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission can experience premature failure, characterized by slipping, jerking, hesitation during acceleration, or unusual noises.
    * Solution: Regular CVT fluid changes are critical. If symptoms persist, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (transmission replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Front Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the front struts or shocks wear out prematurely, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    * Solution: Replace the worn struts/shocks with quality aftermarket or OEM replacements.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on parts and labor).
