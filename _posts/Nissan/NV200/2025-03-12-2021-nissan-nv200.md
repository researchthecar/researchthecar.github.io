The 2021 Nissan NV200 is a compact cargo van powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 131 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque. It is only available with a CVT transmission. Owners often appreciate its maneuverability in urban environments, fuel efficiency, and relatively low price point. Common criticisms include its lack of power, basic interior, and limited cargo capacity compared to larger vans.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing higher-than-expected oil consumption between oil changes. This can manifest as the need to add oil more frequently, a low oil level warning light, and, in severe cases, engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and using the manufacturer-recommended oil type and viscosity can help. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection to check for leaks or internal engine issues is necessary. In some cases, replacing valve stem seals or piston rings might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Inspection costs vary, but repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor leaks to several thousand dollars for major engine work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Shuddering or Hesitation During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a shuddering or hesitant feeling during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds or when starting from a stop. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to find the correct gear ratio.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush might temporarily alleviate the issue. However, in many cases, the problem stems from degradation of the CVT's internal components, necessitating a replacement or rebuild of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: A CVT fluid flush can cost $200-$400. A transmission replacement can cost $3,000 - $5,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the front struts/shocks wearing out prematurely, leading to a bouncy ride, reduced handling stability, and increased noise over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts/shocks is the standard fix. It is recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear) to maintain balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 for a pair, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic drains by testing the current draw when the vehicle is off. Identify and address any faulty components causing the drain. If the battery is old or weak, replacing it is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement $100-$300. Diagnosis of parasitic drain $100+, Repair costs vary depending on the faulty component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera. This can include a black screen, distorted image, or no image at all when the vehicle is in reverse.
    * Solution: Check the camera wiring and connections for damage or corrosion. If the wiring is intact, the camera unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding doors, sticking, or excessive noise during operation.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the door tracks and rollers. Adjust the door alignment if necessary. In some cases, the door rollers or latches may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200 for lubrication and adjustments. $200+ for parts replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2021 Nissan NV200, while appreciated for its practicality and fuel efficiency, can experience a range of issues. The most concerning appear to be the potential for CVT transmission problems and excessive oil consumption, which can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension and electrical problems are also prevalent but tend to be less costly to fix. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
