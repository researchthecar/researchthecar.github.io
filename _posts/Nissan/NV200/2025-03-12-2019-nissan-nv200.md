The 2019 Nissan NV200 is a compact cargo van designed for commercial use and small businesses. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 131 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the NV200's maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and cargo capacity for its size. Common complaints include the underpowered engine, basic interior, and limited features compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil more often than normal, low oil level warnings, and in some cases, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the severity. Start with regular oil level checks. If consumption is significant, a mechanic should inspect for leaks, valve seal issues, or piston ring wear. The most invasive fix would be to replace the piston rings, valves, or engine entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (for oil top off), $100 - $200 (for oil leak inspection), $1,000 - $5,000+ (for engine repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing engine misfires, causing rough idling, decreased performance, and the check engine light to illuminate. Error codes commonly point to issues with the ignition system.
    *   Solution: Start by checking spark plugs and ignition coils, replacing any faulty components. Inspect and clean fuel injectors. If the issue persists, a compression test can help identify cylinder issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (for spark plugs), $100 - $400 (for ignition coils), $100 - $800 (for fuel injectors)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported premature CVT failure. Symptoms include shaking or shuddering during acceleration, slipping, whining noises, and inability to accelerate.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid changes may extend the life of the transmission, but often the solution is a CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Jerky or Hesitant Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience jerky or hesitant shifting, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. This can manifest as a lag between pressing the accelerator and the vehicle responding, or abrupt shifts that make for an uncomfortable driving experience.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change might help, but more significant issues could require valve body replacement or a complete CVT rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (CVT fluid change), $800 - $2,000 (Valve body), $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report ball joints, tie rod ends, and bushings wearing out prematurely, leading to clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints, tie rod ends, and bushings as needed. Regular inspections and lubrication can help extend the life of these components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 per component replaced (ball joints, tie rod ends, bushings), varies greatly based on which component and labor costs
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the battery draining quickly, especially in colder weather, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle. Issues include premature battery failure and parasitic drain.
    *   Solution: Battery replacement is the immediate fix. Diagnose and address any parasitic draws, potentially requiring replacement of faulty modules or wiring repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (battery replacement), $100 - $500 (diagnose and repair parasitic drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensor malfunctions can occur, including issues with the ABS sensor, O2 sensor, and mass airflow sensor, leading to warning lights and performance issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scanning to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400 per sensor replaced, depending on the type of sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the sliding doors, including difficulty opening or closing, sticking, or requiring excessive force to operate. The door latch or rollers may be faulty.
    *   Solution: Inspect and lubricate the door tracks and rollers. Replace any damaged or worn components, such as the door latch or rollers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (lubrication and minor adjustments), $200 - $500+ (door latch or roller replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In certain climates or with prolonged sun exposure, some owners report the dashboard cracking.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard, use a sunshade to protect the dashboard, or cover it with a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (dashboard cover), $500 - $1500+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2019 Nissan NV200, while appreciated for its practicality and fuel efficiency, has several common issues. The most concerning are CVT failures and excessive oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. Premature wear of suspension components and electrical issues are also prevalent. The sliding door mechanism can be problematic as well. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the possibility of repairs when considering this vehicle.
