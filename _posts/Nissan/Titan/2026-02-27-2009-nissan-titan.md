- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Automatic (RE5R05A)
**Harsh Shifting / Delayed Engagement**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission may hesitate to engage gears, shift roughly, or slip between gears. Can sometimes be accompanied by a check engine light.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or in severe cases, transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $300 - $2500+


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Ball Joints / Tie Rod Ends**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, loose steering feel, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Gremlins**
- **Symptoms:** Various electrical components may malfunction intermittently, including power windows, door locks, interior lights, or the instrument cluster.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.

- **Symptoms:** Rust and corrosion forming on the rear bumper, particularly in areas exposed to road salt and moisture.
- **Solution:** Repair or replacement of the affected bumper section.
- **Cost:** $200 - $500


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blend Door Actuator Failure**

### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Nissan Titan, powered by its reliable 5.6L V8, offers strong performance but is not without its potential issues. Common concerns include leaks from the oil cooler lines and cracked exhaust manifolds on the engine, and harsh shifting or delayed engagement with the 5-speed automatic transmission. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rod ends can wear prematurely. Electrical problems, particularly with the Body Control Module and alternator, have also been reported. Minor issues like rear bumper corrosion and interior HVAC blend door actuator failures are also noted. Overall, while the Titan is a capable truck, owners should be aware of these potential reliability concerns and budget for possible repairs beyond standard maintenance.
