**Engine**

**5.6L Endurance V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms may include low oil level warnings, visible exhaust smoke, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: The cause of excessive oil consumption can vary. It may be due to faulty PCV valves, worn piston rings, or valve seals. A diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is recommended to pinpoint the exact cause and determine the appropriate repair. Replacing piston rings is a labor-intensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ for engine rebuild or replacement. Less if the PCV valve is the root cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported occasional engine misfires, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Potential causes include faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. A diagnostic scan can identify the cylinder experiencing the misfire. Replacement of the faulty component is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the failed component and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have described experiencing harsh or jerky shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Some have also noted hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: A possible solution is a software update to the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, a valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for software update. $800 - $2,000+ for valve body replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping occurs when the transmission fails to properly engage or hold a gear. Symptoms can include the engine revving higher than normal without a corresponding increase in speed, a delayed response when shifting, or the transmission feeling like it's "losing" power.
    *   Solution: In most cases, transmission slipping requires a complete rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
