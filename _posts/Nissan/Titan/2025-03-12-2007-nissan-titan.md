The 2007 Nissan Titan is a full-size pickup truck that was available in a variety of configurations, including King Cab and Crew Cab models, with either two-wheel or four-wheel drive. All 2007 Titans came equipped with a 5.6-liter V8 engine producing 317 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Titan for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. However, some common complaints included issues with reliability, fuel economy, and certain components prematurely failing.

**Engine**

**5.6L VK56DE V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue is cracking of the exhaust manifolds, often leading to a ticking or hissing noise, especially upon cold start. This is due to thermal stress and the design of the manifolds.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifold(s) with new or aftermarket manifolds.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on whether doing one or both manifolds and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Can result from a cracked exhaust manifold allowing fragments into the catalytic converter or the catalytic converter breaking down internally. Symptoms include poor performance, check engine light (typically a P0420 or P0430 code), and potentially a sulfur smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter(s) and addressing the root cause if applicable (e.g., replacing a cracked manifold).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (depending on the number of converters replaced and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front timing cover. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, oil spots under the vehicle, and a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the affected gasket or seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**RE5R05A 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body in the RE5R05A transmission can experience wear and tear, leading to shifting problems, such as hard shifts, slipping, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body with updated components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ (depending on whether replacing or rebuilding)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause shuddering, stalling, or complete loss of transmission function.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sag/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs can sag over time, leading to a loss of ride height, reduced load-carrying capacity, and potentially a rough ride. They are also prone to breaking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Wheel Bearing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Grinding noise, especially when turning; wheel play when jacked up.
    * Solution: Replace the wheel bearing and possibly the hub assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **IPDM (Intelligent Power Distribution Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The IPDM controls various electrical functions. Failures can cause a wide range of issues, including starting problems, fuel pump issues, and headlight malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IPDM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Bed and Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust, particularly in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure, such as the bed and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement. Prevention with rust inhibitors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or use of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to go up or down, or making unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Nissan Titan, while appreciated for its power and capability, faces a range of issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems such as exhaust manifold cracking and catalytic converter failure can be costly to address. Transmission issues, suspension wear, and electrical problems with the IPDM are also common. Rust can be a significant concern, particularly in certain climates. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to substantial repair bills, potentially impacting the overall cost of ownership. Thorough inspection and maintenance are crucial for mitigating these issues.
