- **Symptoms:** Coolant leaks, rough idle, potential engine overheating.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
- **Symptoms:** Exhaust leak noise (ticking or puffing sound), especially on cold starts; potential loss of power.
- **Solution:** Replacement of cracked exhaust manifolds or use of high-temperature sealant for minor cracks.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Automatic RE5R05A
**Harsh Shifting / Delayed Engagement**
- **Symptoms:** Jerking or clunking when shifting gears, delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2500+

**Torque Converter Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Shuddering at certain speeds, slipping, or failure to lock up.
- **Solution:** Torque converter replacement.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Leaf Spring Sagging**
- **Symptoms:** Rear end appears lower than normal, reduced towing/hauling capacity, poor ride quality.
- **Solution:** Replacement of rear leaf springs.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Gremlins**
- **Symptoms:** Various electrical components (lights, power windows, radio) acting erratically or failing to work.

### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Nissan Titan, while a capable and powerful truck, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and class. The 5.6L V8 engine can experience issues like intake manifold gasket leaks and cracked exhaust manifolds. The 5-speed automatic transmission is prone to harsh shifting and torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and premature alternator failure are also noted. On the exterior, clear coat peeling is a cosmetic concern. Interiorly, the HVAC blend door actuator is a recurring issue. Despite these points, many owners find the Titan to be a dependable vehicle with proper maintenance, and the issues are generally repairable.
