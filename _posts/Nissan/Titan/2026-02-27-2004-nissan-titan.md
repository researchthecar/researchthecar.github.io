### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Nissan Titan is a capable truck with a powerful V8 engine. While it generally holds up well, common issues to be aware of include potential leaks from the intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines, as well as transmission problems like harsh shifting or overheating, particularly with higher mileage. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and premature alternator failure have also been reported. Suspension components like leaf springs can wear out, and minor exterior issues like tailgate handle failure are not uncommon. Interior climate control can be affected by blower motor resistor issues. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential problems can help ensure the longevity of the 2004 Titan.
