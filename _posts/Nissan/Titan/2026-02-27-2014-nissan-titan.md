### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Nissan Titan is a capable truck with a strong powertrain. The most commonly reported issues revolve around the transmission's tendency for harsh shifting and potential leaks from the engine's oil cooler lines or intake manifold gaskets. Electrical gremlins, often traced to the BCM, and premature alternator failure are also noted concerns. Suspension components like ball joints can wear over time, and some owners have reported corrosion on the rear bumper. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas warrant attention for owners to ensure long-term reliability and to avoid more costly repairs down the line. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key.
