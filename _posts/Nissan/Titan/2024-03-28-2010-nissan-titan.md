## 2010 Nissan Titan

The 2010 Nissan Titan is a full-size pickup truck offered with a choice of two engines: a 5.6-liter V8 with 317 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0-liter V6 with 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Titan is available in four trim levels: S, SV, Pro-4X, and SL.

The Titan is a popular choice for buyers who need a powerful and capable truck. It has a spacious cabin with plenty of room for passengers and cargo. However, it is worth noting that the Titan has a relatively low fuel economy rating and can be expensive to maintain.
