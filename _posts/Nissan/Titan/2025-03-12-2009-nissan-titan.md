Common complaints include lower fuel economy compared to competitors and some reports of reliability issues.

**Engine**

**5.6L VK56DE V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking/Leaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A cracked exhaust manifold can cause a ticking or hissing sound, especially upon startup. The sound may diminish as the engine warms up. This can also lead to reduced fuel efficiency and a potential exhaust smell inside the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, rattling noises from underneath the vehicle, and a "Check Engine" light with codes indicating catalytic converter inefficiency (e.g., P0420, P0430).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine rattling noise, especially upon startup. Can also trigger a check engine light. May lead to engine damage if not addressed.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable slippage between gears, delayed or harsh shifting, and difficulty maintaining consistent speeds. This may be more apparent when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Often requires a transmission rebuild or replacement, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the truck sits lower than the front, especially when carrying a load. This can lead to reduced payload capacity and a rougher ride. In severe cases, the leaf springs may crack or break.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Humming or growling noise coming from the front wheels that changes with speed. Can also cause vibrations in the steering wheel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ per wheel
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **IPDM (Intelligent Power Distribution Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting problems, stalling, headlight issues, fuel pump failures, and other seemingly unrelated electrical malfunctions. The IPDM controls many electrical functions in the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IPDM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Sending Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate fuel gauge readings, even when the tank is full or nearly empty. This can lead to running out of fuel unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel sending unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage and Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the frame, suspension components, and other undercarriage parts. This is particularly common in areas with heavy road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust removal and preventative coating, or in severe cases, frame repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$2000+ (depending on severity, preventative rust proofing is far cheaper)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, often due to sun exposure and temperature changes.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$1200+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Nissan Titan has several potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems such as exhaust manifold cracking and transmission issues are common. The suspension system is susceptible to wear and tear, especially the rear leaf springs. Electrical problems with the IPDM and fuel sending unit can also occur. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission overhauls, can be quite costly. Checking for rust and carefully inspecting the electrical system are recommended before purchasing a used 2009 Titan.
