## Engine

### 5.6L V8 (VK56DE)
**Oil Cooler Line Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Leaking oil from the front of the engine, often near the oil filter housing. Can lead to low oil levels if not addressed.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the leaking oil cooler lines.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Vacuum leaks, rough idle, potential misfires, and sometimes a sweet smell of coolant if the coolant passages are affected.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Automatic (RE5R05A)
**Harsh Shifting / Delayed Engagement**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission may hesitate to engage gears, shift roughly, or slip between gears. Can sometimes be accompanied by error codes.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter service, solenoid replacement, or in severe cases, transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $500 - $3000+


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Front Suspension Clunks/Rattles**
- **Symptoms:** Noise from the front end, particularly over bumps or when turning. Often related to worn ball joints or control arm bushings.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn suspension components (ball joints, control arms, bushings).
- **Cost:** $500 - $1200


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Gremlins**
- **Symptoms:** Various electrical components may malfunction intermittently, such as power windows, interior lights, or dashboard warnings. Can be difficult to diagnose.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $600 - $1500


### Alternator
**Premature Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Battery warning light illumination, dimming headlights, or complete loss of electrical power while driving.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Exterior

### Body Panels
**Tailgate Latch Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Difficulty opening or closing the tailgate, or the tailgate not latching securely.
- **Solution:** Lubrication or replacement of the tailgate latch mechanism.
- **Cost:** $150 - $400


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blend Door Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Inability to control temperature (stuck on hot or cold), or air only blowing from certain vents.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator.
- **Cost:** $200 - $500

### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Nissan Titan, powered by its reliable 5.6L V8, offers a strong foundation for a work truck. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil cooler line leaks and intake manifold gasket problems, which are not uncommon. The 5-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting or engagement issues, often requiring fluid services or component replacements. Suspension noises from the front end are also a reported concern. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM, and premature alternator failure can add to repair costs. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most frequent non-wear-and-tear issues reported for this model year.
