### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Nissan Titan, while a capable truck, exhibits some common issues that owners should be aware of. The 5.6L V8 engine can develop leaks from its intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines. The 5-speed automatic transmission is prone to harsh shifting and overheating, often requiring fluid services or cooling system upgrades. Suspension components, particularly the leaf springs, can wear out, leading to sagging. Electrical gremlins, often traced to the BCM or alternator, are also reported. Exterior rust, especially on the frame, is a concern in certain climates. Interiorly, the HVAC blower motor resistor is a known failure point. Despite these potential issues, many Titans remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
