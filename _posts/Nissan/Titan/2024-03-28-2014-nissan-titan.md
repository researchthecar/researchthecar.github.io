**2014 Nissan Titan**

The 2014 Nissan Titan is a full-size pickup truck that is available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine is a 5.6-liter V8 that produces 317 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine is a 5.0-liter V8 that produces 390 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a standard six-speed automatic transmission, but a seven-speed automatic transmission is available as an option with the 5.0-liter V8.

The Titan has a spacious interior and a comfortable ride, but it is not as fuel-efficient as some of its competitors. The truck also has a relatively low payload and towing capacity.
