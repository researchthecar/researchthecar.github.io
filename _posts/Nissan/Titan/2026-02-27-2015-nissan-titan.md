### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Nissan Titan, powered exclusively by its 5.6L V8, is a capable truck with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the engine's oil cooler lines and intake manifold gaskets, which can develop leaks. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while robust, can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Suspension components, particularly front-end parts, may require attention over time. Electrical issues, such as BCM glitches and infotainment system unresponsiveness, are also noted. Exterior and interior components like the tailgate handle and seat heaters can also be points of failure. Overall, the Titan is a dependable choice for those prioritizing V8 power and towing, but owners should be aware of these potential repair areas.
