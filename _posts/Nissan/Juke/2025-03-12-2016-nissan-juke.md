The 2016 Nissan Juke is a subcompact crossover known for its quirky styling and sporty handling. It's powered by a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 188 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. It was offered with either a 6-speed manual transmission (FWD models only) or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) with available All-Wheel Drive (AWD). People often appreciate the Juke's distinctive look and fun driving dynamics, but some dislike its limited cargo space and polarizing design.

**Engine**

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4 (MR16DDT)**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with premature timing chain wear or failure. Symptoms include a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold, and potential engine misfires or stalling. In more severe cases, the engine may not start at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can sometimes fail, leading to a significant loss of power, increased exhaust smoke, and potential engine damage. Whining noises from the turbocharger are often a precursor to failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking for leaks, performing a compression test, or inspecting the PCV valve. Depending on the cause, repairs could range from replacing seals to a more extensive engine overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+ (depending on the root cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Belt Slippage/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission can experience belt slippage, causing jerky acceleration, hesitation, and a general lack of responsiveness. In some cases, the transmission may fail completely.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT transmission or, in some cases, repairing it if the damage is not extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body, responsible for controlling fluid flow within the CVT, can develop issues leading to erratic shifting, harsh engagement, and transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear shock absorbers can leak or fail, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle sits unused for several days.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the source of the drain, which could be a faulty electrical component or parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor resistor can fail, resulting in the loss of some or all fan speeds for the climate control system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The liftgate struts can weaken over time, causing the liftgate to not stay open or to fall closed unexpectedly.
    * Solution: Replacing the liftgate struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2016 Nissan Juke can be a fun and stylish vehicle but it's important to be aware of some potential issues, particularly with the engine and CVT transmission. The most concerning problems involve the CVT, which can be expensive to repair or replace. Other issues, such as timing chain problems and turbocharger failure, can also lead to significant repair costs. It's essential to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to assess the condition of the engine, transmission, and other critical components. Overall, the 2016 Nissan Juke has the potential for costly repairs, especially regarding the CVT, so it is crucial to ensure the vehicle has been maintained and inspected.
