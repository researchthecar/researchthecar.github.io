### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Nissan Juke exhibits moderate reliability, with the turbocharged engine and CVT transmission being the primary areas of concern. Owners of the 1.6L turbo should be aware of potential turbocharger and PCV system issues, while CVT owners may encounter shuddering, hesitation, or overheating problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment and keyless entry systems, are also noted. The naturally aspirated engine and manual transmission variants appear to be more robust. While the suspension, exterior, and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should factor in the possibility of powertrain and electrical repairs when considering this model.
