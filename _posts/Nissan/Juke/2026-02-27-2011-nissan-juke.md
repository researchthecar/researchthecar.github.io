### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Nissan Juke, particularly models equipped with the 1.6L turbocharged engine and the CVT transmission, presents a few key areas of concern. Turbocharger issues and potential problems with the CVT, such as fluid leaks or control module failures, are the most significant reported technical reliability concerns. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment and keyless entry systems, can also arise. However, the naturally aspirated engine and manual transmission variants appear to be more robust. Suspension, exterior, and interior components generally do not exhibit widespread issues. Regular maintenance, especially for the CVT fluid, and prompt attention to any warning signs are crucial for mitigating potential repair costs and ensuring the longevity of the vehicle.
