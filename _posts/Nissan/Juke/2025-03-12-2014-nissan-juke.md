The 2014 Nissan Juke is a compact crossover known for its distinctive styling and sporty handling. The standard engine is a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 188 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. It comes with either a 6-speed manual transmission (FWD models only) or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) with available all-wheel drive (AWD). The Nismo and Nismo RS models also feature the same 1.6-liter turbo engine but with increased power output. Owners often praise the Juke's unique design and responsive engine, but some find the rear seat cramped and the ride a bit stiff. Common dislikes include limited cargo space and the CVT transmission's performance.

**Engine**

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4 (MR16DDT)**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine rattle, especially upon startup, can indicate a stretched or worn timing chain. If left unaddressed, it can lead to engine damage. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to camshaft/crankshaft correlation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and potentially the camshaft sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty injector(s) and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, slipping, shuddering, whining noises, and erratic shifting behavior. Can trigger warning lights. Many experience complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or fluid change can temporarily alleviate minor issues. However, more severe problems often necessitate a complete CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls:
        *   **PC392:** Certain Jukes manufactured from January 30, 2013, through May 23, 2013, may have a defective transmission control unit (TCU) that may cause the transmission to enter a "fail-safe" mode.

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during light acceleration or at highway speeds, particularly noticeable when the torque converter locks up.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter is often required. In some cases, it may be recommended to replace the entire CVT unit if the torque converter failure has caused internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ (Torque Converter or CVT Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive rear-end sway during cornering, and clunking noises from the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery after short periods of inactivity, difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Thorough electrical system diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic drain. Possible causes include faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Level Sensor Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate fuel gauge readings, fuel gauge fluctuating erratically, or fuel gauge remaining at empty even when the tank is full. Can also cause a check engine light
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel level sensor, which is typically integrated with the fuel pump assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door handle breaking or becoming difficult to use, especially in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air, especially during hot weather. Can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a failing compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the A/C system to determine the cause of the problem and repair or replacement of the affected components (e.g., compressor, condenser, expansion valve, blend door actuator).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan Juke has several potential issues that owners should be aware of. The most significant concern revolves around the CVT transmission, which is prone to failure and can be costly to replace. Other issues include timing chain problems, fuel injector failures, and electrical glitches. While some repairs are relatively minor, the potential for major CVT and engine repairs makes it crucial to thoroughly inspect a used Juke before purchasing. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for a transmission replacement. Be sure to check for any outstanding recalls on the vehicle as well.
