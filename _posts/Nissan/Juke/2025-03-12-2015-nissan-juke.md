The 2015 Nissan Juke is a subcompact crossover known for its distinctive styling and sporty handling. The base engine is a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4, producing 188 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Higher trim levels, like the NISMO RS, bumped that output to 215 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque (with the 6-speed manual) or 211 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque (with the CVT). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual (FWD only) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) available with either FWD or AWD. Drivers often appreciate the Juke's nimble feel and unique design, while some find its small back seat and limited cargo space to be drawbacks.

**Engine**

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4 (DIG-T)**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise on startup, especially in cold weather. Can lead to engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, whistling or whining noise from the turbo.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation upon acceleration, jerking or shuddering, high RPMs with slow acceleration, complete transmission failure. Often accompanied by a "check engine" light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT. Some minor issues can be addressed by a CVT fluid flush and reprogramming of the TCU (Transmission Control Unit), but this is not always effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+ (CVT replacement). Fluid flush around $200-$400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Summary**

The 2015 Nissan Juke, while stylish and fun to drive, has some potential issues to be aware of. The most significant concern revolves around the CVT transmission, which can experience premature failure. Engine issues like timing chain problems and turbocharger failure can also be costly to address. Electrical problems and suspension wear are less severe but still require attention. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate to severe, with repair costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars for major transmission or engine work. Buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history, pay close attention to any unusual noises or behavior during a test drive, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
