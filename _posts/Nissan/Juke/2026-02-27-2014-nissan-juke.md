### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Nissan Juke's reliability is largely dependent on its powertrain. The naturally aspirated and turbocharged 1.6L engines can experience issues like oil consumption and turbocharger problems, respectively, while the CVT transmission is prone to shuddering and overheating. These are the most significant areas to consider for potential repairs. The manual transmission and other systems like suspension, electrical (beyond infotainment/keyless entry), exterior, and interior components generally fare better, with fewer widespread reported issues. Prospective buyers should pay close attention to the maintenance history of the engine and transmission, especially if considering a CVT model.
