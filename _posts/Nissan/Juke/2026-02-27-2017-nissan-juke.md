### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Nissan Juke offers a mixed bag in terms of reliability. The naturally aspirated 1.6L engine and manual transmission variants are generally robust with few reported widespread issues. However, the turbocharged 1.6L engine can be prone to turbocharger problems and oil consumption, while the CVT transmission has seen reports of hesitation, jerking, and overheating. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and keyless entry, are also noted. While not a universally problematic vehicle, potential buyers should be particularly mindful of the powertrain and electrical systems, especially if considering models with the CVT or turbocharged engine. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are crucial for ensuring longevity.
