The 2012 Nissan Juke is a quirky subcompact crossover known for its distinctive styling and sporty handling. The standard engine is a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 188 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (available only on the front-wheel-drive models) and a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). People generally like the Juke's fun driving dynamics and unique look, while common dislikes include limited rear passenger space and polarizing styling.
