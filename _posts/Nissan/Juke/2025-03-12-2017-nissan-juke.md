The 2017 Nissan Juke is a subcompact crossover known for its distinctive styling and sporty handling. It's powered by a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 188 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. The base model is offered with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). All-wheel drive is available and only comes with the CVT. Owners often praise the Juke's unique look and nimble driving dynamics. However, some criticisms include its small rear seats and cargo area, as well as polarizing styling.

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is a common source of complaints. Symptoms include slipping, shuddering, hesitation during acceleration, erratic shifting, and complete transmission failure. The transmission may also go into "limp mode," restricting speed and performance.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update or fluid change might temporarily alleviate symptoms. However, in many cases, complete transmission replacement is necessary.

**Summary:**

The 2017 Nissan Juke presents a mixed bag of potential issues. The most concerning and costly problems relate to the CVT transmission, which is prone to failure and can be expensive to replace. Engine issues, like timing chain wear and turbocharger failure, also contribute to potential repair costs. Electrical problems and minor exterior/interior issues are less severe but can still be annoying and require attention. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history, especially concerning the CVT, before making a purchase.
