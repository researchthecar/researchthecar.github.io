## 2012 Nissan Juke

The 2012 Nissan Juke is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its sporty handling and distinctive styling. It is available with three engine options: a 1.6-liter inline-4, a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4, and a 2.0-liter inline-4. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed CVT, and a 6-speed manual. The Juke is praised for its agile driving dynamics, but it has also received criticism for its cramped interior and limited cargo space.
