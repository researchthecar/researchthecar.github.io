**Introduction to the 2016 Nissan Juke**

The 2016 Nissan Juke is a compact crossover SUV known for its unique and sporty design. It is available in two trim levels: S and SV. The S trim is powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 188 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. The SV trim is powered by a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 215 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT).

Drivers appreciate the Juke's fun and engaging driving experience, spacious interior for its size, and distinctive styling. However, complaints include its limited cargo space, lackluster fuel economy, and subpar interior materials in lower trims.
