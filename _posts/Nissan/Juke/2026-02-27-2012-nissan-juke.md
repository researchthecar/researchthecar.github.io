### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Nissan Juke generally presents a decent reliability record, particularly with its naturally aspirated engine and manual transmission. The turbocharged engine, while offering more performance, has a higher propensity for issues like turbocharger failure and PCV valve problems, which can be costly to repair. The CVT transmission, a common feature, has been known to experience issues related to fluid leaks, overheating, and belt slippage, necessitating diligent maintenance and potentially expensive repairs if problems arise. Electrical gremlins, such as keyless entry malfunctions and infotainment system glitches, are also noted. Owners should prioritize regular maintenance, especially for the CVT fluid, and be aware of the specific needs of the turbocharged engine to ensure long-term reliability.
