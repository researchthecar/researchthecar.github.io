The 2023 Nissan Qashqai S represents the entry-level trim of the popular compact SUV. It's equipped with a 1.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Higher trims of the 2023 Qashqai may feature different engines and transmissions, but this response focuses solely on the 'S' trim's standard configuration. Owners appreciate the Qashqai for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and nimble handling. However, some common criticisms include the CVT's performance and the basic features offered in the base 'S' trim.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption requiring frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. This may be noticed through low oil level warnings or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Addressing oil consumption issues often involves inspecting for leaks, checking piston rings and valve stem seals for wear, and potentially replacing the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+, depending on the root cause and necessary repairs.

*   **CVT Hesitation and Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT may exhibit hesitation upon acceleration, particularly from a stop. Some owners have also reported jerky or uneven acceleration, especially at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change with genuine Nissan CVT fluid can sometimes resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, the CVT valve body may need to be replaced or the entire transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
