The 2004 Nissan X-Trail is a compact SUV known for its practicality and off-road capabilities, especially with its available All-Mode 4x4 system. It came with a 2.5-liter QR25DE inline-4 engine producing approximately 165 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. A smaller 2.0-liter engine was also available in some markets but wasn't prevalent in North America. Transmission options were primarily a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the X-Trail's spacious interior and reliability. However, common complaints include rust issues, some electrical quirks, and the vehicle's relatively basic interior.
