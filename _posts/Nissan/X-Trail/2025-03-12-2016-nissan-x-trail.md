**Engine**

**2.0L Four-Cylinder**

*   **No Issues Found**

**2.5L Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.5L engine consuming more oil than normal, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is needed to determine the cause, which could range from worn piston rings, valve seals, or PCV valve issues. Repair may involve replacing affected parts, or in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is a known weak point in some Nissan models. Issues include shuddering, slipping, hesitation, jerking, and complete failure. These problems can occur at relatively low mileage.
    *   Solution: The fix can range from a CVT fluid change and software update to a complete CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$4,000+
