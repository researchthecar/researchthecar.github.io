The 2022 Nissan X-Trail (also known as the Rogue in some markets) represents a significant redesign for the model. In many markets, the primary engine option is a 2.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 181 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some markets also offer a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine with Nissan's e-Power hybrid system. Drivers often praise the X-Trail for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and updated technology, while some common complaints include the CVT's performance and occasional concerns about the infotainment system's responsiveness.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as the oil level dropping significantly after only a few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: The issue can be a variety of causes, including, but not limited to, leaky valve seals or piston rings. The specific cause would require diagnosis.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Repair costs vary widely depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have described experiencing engine misfires, which may be accompanied by a rough idle or hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause may include checking for faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L Turbocharged Three-Cylinder (e-Power Hybrid)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Hesitation and Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation upon acceleration or experiencing jerking motions at low speeds with the CVT.
    *   Solution: A software update may help in some cases. A CVT fluid change may also mitigate the issue. In more severe cases, CVT replacement could be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of ball joint, sway bar link, and strut/shock absorber failures at relatively low mileage. Symptoms include clunking noises from the suspension, uneven tire wear, and diminished ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per corner, depending on the component and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, including the touchscreen display, may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Restarting the system can offer a temporary fix, however, a software update may be required. In more severe cases, the infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty sensors can result in incorrect warnings or failure to detect objects. This may include issues with the blind spot monitoring system, parking sensors, or other driver-assistance features.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on location and accessibility.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling and Squeaking Noises**

    *   Solution: Identify and address the source of the noise by tightening fasteners, adding padding, or replacing loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Nissan X-Trail presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While many owners enjoy the vehicle's design and features, the CVT, infotainment system, and potential for engine issues are areas of concern. Suspension wear is an important point to note, too. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, but addressing potential problems early is crucial for long-term reliability.
