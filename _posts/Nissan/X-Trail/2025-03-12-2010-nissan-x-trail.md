The 2010 Nissan X-Trail is a compact crossover SUV offering a blend of practicality and comfort. In the Australian market, the X-Trail came with several engine and transmission options. The most common engine option was the 2.5-liter four-cylinder petrol engine, producing around 125 kW (169 hp) and 233 Nm of torque. Other engine options included a 2.0-liter four-cylinder petrol engine, and a 2.0-liter diesel engine. Transmission options typically included a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally liked the X-Trail for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and off-road capabilities, while common complaints revolved around fuel economy, especially with the 2.5L engine, and some reliability issues.
