### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Nissan X-Trail is a generally dependable vehicle, but like many SUVs of its vintage, it is not immune to specific issues. Common concerns revolve around the petrol engine's oil consumption and the diesel engine's turbocharger and injectors. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic variant's torque converter and solenoids, can be costly. Suspension components like bushings and strut mounts are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, and exterior rust, especially in wheel arches, are other areas to watch. Interior wear on seats and HVAC blower motor issues are also noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential problems are crucial for maintaining the X-Trail's reliability.
