**Introduction**

The 2008 Nissan X-Trail is a compact SUV that was offered with a range of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder with 166 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual transmission or a CVT. A more powerful 3.5-liter V6 with 261 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque was also available, exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission.
