### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Nissan X-Trail generally presents a solid reliability record, particularly with its petrol engines and manual transmissions. The primary areas of concern tend to be the CVT transmission, which can be prone to fluid leaks and belt issues, and some diesel engine components like the turbocharger and EGR valve, especially if not maintained diligently. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and sensor faults, are not uncommon but are typically repairable. Overall, the X-Trail is a capable SUV, but potential buyers should pay close attention to the maintenance history, especially regarding the transmission and any diesel-specific components.
