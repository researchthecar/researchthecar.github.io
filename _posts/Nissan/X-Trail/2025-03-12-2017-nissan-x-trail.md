The 2017 Nissan X-Trail is a compact SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency. The most common engine option is the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder QR25DE engine producing around 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT) are the available transmission options. Owners generally appreciate the X-Trail's practicality, ample cargo space, and smooth CVT. Common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired interior design, and in some cases, concerns about CVT reliability.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating, the need to add oil frequently, and potentially blue-ish smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can address the issue, while in other cases, engine replacement may be necessary if the problem is severe.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and chosen repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may fail emissions testing, the check engine light will illuminate, and diagnostic codes related to catalytic converter efficiency will be present. Reduced engine performance can also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Belt Slippage/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, jerking or shuddering, a whining noise from the transmission, and the transmission failing to engage properly or going into limp mode. Diagnostic trouble codes related to the CVT may also be present.
    *   Solution: Complete CVT replacement. A software update may resolve minor issues, but mechanical failure usually requires a new transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ for a new CVT installed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, delayed engagement, harsh shifting, or the transmission getting stuck in a particular gear. The transmission may slip or fail to engage at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body may solve the issue. In some cases, a complete transmission replacement is necessary if the damage is extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Rear Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the rear suspension, uneven tire wear, and a feeling of looseness or instability when driving over bumps. The rear suspension bushings, specifically those on the control arms, may wear out prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings and/or control arms. An alignment may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side, depending on the specific parts replaced and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a short period of time, making it difficult or impossible to start the vehicle. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty electrical component.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw, which may involve testing various electrical components and circuits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the complexity of the issue and the labor required for diagnosis and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Backup Camera**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera display shows a distorted image, a blank screen, or no image at all. The camera may work intermittently or fail completely.
    *   Solution: Replacing the backup camera or repairing the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on part and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate fails to open or close properly, gets stuck mid-operation, or makes unusual noises. The motor or sensors may be faulty.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate motor, sensors, or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the specific parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak airflow, warm air blowing from the vents, or a complete failure of the air conditioning system. Common causes include refrigerant leaks, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Repairing refrigerant leaks, replacing the compressor or blend door actuator, or recharging the refrigerant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1200+ depending on the specific issue and parts required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2017 Nissan X-Trail has several potential issues owners should be aware of. The most concerning are related to the CVT transmission, which can be expensive to repair or replace. Excessive oil consumption and electrical problems also surface frequently. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, check for service records, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic to identify potential problems before making a purchase.
