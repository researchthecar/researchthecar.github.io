### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Nissan X-Trail offers a mixed but generally acceptable reliability profile for its age and class. The petrol engines, particularly the QR20DE, can be prone to oil consumption and sensor issues, while the diesel variants may face turbocharger and injector problems. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, are not uncommon as mileage increases. Suspension components like bushings and strut mounts are typical wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, can also surface. Exterior rust, particularly in wheel arches, is a concern for vehicles in humid or salty environments. Overall, the X-Trail is a reasonably robust vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
