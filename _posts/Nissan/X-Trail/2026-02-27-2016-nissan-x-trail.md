### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Nissan X-Trail generally presents a reliable profile, with most owners experiencing few significant mechanical issues. The petrol engines (2.0L and 2.5L) are largely dependable, though the 2.5L has seen some reports of oil consumption. The diesel 1.6L dCi can be prone to Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) issues, especially in urban driving conditions. The CVT transmission, while common, has had isolated reports of hesitation or overheating, suggesting the importance of regular fluid maintenance. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Overall, the X-Trail is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and ensure proper maintenance, especially for the CVT and DPF systems.
