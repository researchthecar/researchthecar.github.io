The 2019 Nissan X-Trail is a compact SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available third-row seating (depending on the market; not available in the US). Engine options include a 2.0L four-cylinder (around 144 hp and 147 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.5L four-cylinder engine (around 170 hp and 175 lb-ft of torque). Most models are equipped with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). People appreciate the X-Trail for its practicality and fuel efficiency. Some common complaints revolve around the CVT's performance and the sometimes-lackluster acceleration with the smaller engines.

**Engine**

**2.5L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil pressure warning light illuminating, engine knocking, or blue exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Nissan has performed oil consumption tests and replaced the engine under warranty if consumption exceeds a specified threshold. Other solutions may involve replacing piston rings or other internal engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the severity and the chosen repair. Could range from minor repairs in the hundreds to a complete engine replacement in the thousands ($3,000 - $7,000+).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, especially at idle or during acceleration. Noises like clunking or thumping from the engine bay.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn or broken engine mount(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on which mount needs replacement and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Four-Cylinder Engine**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jutter/Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or vibrating sensation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to find the right gear.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change can temporarily alleviate the issue. However, the underlying problem might require a more extensive repair or replacement of the CVT. Nissan extended the warranty on some CVTs due to these issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change: $200-$400. CVT replacement: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete loss of power, inability to accelerate, or loud whining noises coming from the transmission. Warning lights on the dashboard may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ depending on the number of struts/shocks replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car may have difficulty starting, or the battery may completely drain overnight.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the parasitic draw, which could be a faulty module, relay, or aftermarket accessory. Replacing the battery may be necessary if it has been repeatedly drained.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen may freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot.
    *   Solution: Sometimes, a software update can resolve the issue. In other cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (if available): $0 - $150. Infotainment unit replacement: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or it may make unusual noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate motor, struts, or associated sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light Illumination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential problem with the airbag system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the airbag system is required to determine the cause of the fault. This could involve replacing a sensor, wiring harness, or the airbag module itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Nissan X-Trail has several potential issues. The most concerning are related to the CVT transmission, which can experience shuddering, slipping, or complete failure. Engine issues such as oil consumption can also be costly to address. Other, less severe problems involve the suspension, electrical system, and interior components. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can lead to substantial repair bills. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic, paying close attention to the condition of the CVT and engine.
