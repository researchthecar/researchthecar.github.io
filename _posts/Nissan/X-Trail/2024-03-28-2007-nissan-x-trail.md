**Introduction:**

The 2007 Nissan X-Trail is a compact SUV that offers a spacious interior, versatile seating arrangements, and standard all-wheel drive. It is available with two engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 166 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 with 240 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. The X-Trail is praised for its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and impressive off-road capabilities. However, some owners have reported issues with the vehicle's engine, transmission, and other components.
