### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Nissan X-Trail is generally considered a reliable vehicle, particularly its petrol engine variants. The QR20DE and QR25DE engines are known for their robustness, though some owners report oil consumption or VVT system issues on higher mileage examples. The diesel M9R engine, while offering good torque, can be susceptible to DPF and EGR problems, common in many modern diesels. Transmissions, especially the CVT, require diligent maintenance to avoid costly repairs; manual transmissions are typically more durable. Suspension components like bushings and strut mounts can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical issues are not a major concern, with window regulators and alternators being the most common failures. Overall, with regular maintenance and attention to potential weak points, the 2008 X-Trail can be a dependable choice.
