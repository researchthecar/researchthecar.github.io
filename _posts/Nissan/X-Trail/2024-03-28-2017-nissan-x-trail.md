**Introduction:**

The 2017 Nissan X-Trail is a compact SUV available with two engine and transmission options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with a CVT or a 3.5-liter V6 engine with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5-liter engine produces 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.5-liter engine produces 261 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. The X-Trail is known for its spacious cabin, wide range of safety features, and comfortable ride quality. However, it has received some criticism for its lack of driving excitement and subpar fuel economy.
