The 2021 Nissan X-Trail, also known as the Rogue in some markets, is a compact SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. In many markets, the 2021 X-Trail comes standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 181 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate its fuel efficiency and smooth ride, while others dislike its somewhat uninspired engine performance and occasional CVT drone. Common complaints also include issues with the infotainment system and certain advanced driver-assistance features.

**Engine**

**2.5L I4 (QR25DE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as the need to add a quart of oil every 1,000-3,000 miles.
    *   Solution: The repair often involves replacing the piston rings and potentially other internal engine components depending on the severity of the damage. In some cases, a complete engine replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration felt in the cabin, especially at idle or during acceleration. May also hear clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed engine mount(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 (depending on which mount(s) need replacing and labor costs)

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Juddering/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable juddering, shaking, or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is slipping.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid flush and reset of the transmission control module (TCM) might temporarily alleviate the issue. However, the long-term solution often involves replacing the CVT unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 for fluid flush and reset; $3,000 - $8,000+ for CVT replacement.

*   **Premature CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission fails prematurely, sometimes with little warning. Symptoms can include complete loss of power, loud whining noises, or inability to shift.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT unit is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision and potential uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on which bushings are replaced and labor costs)

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve the issue. If not, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves); $500 - $1500+ for infotainment unit replacement

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Automatic Emergency Braking)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alerts or failure of advanced driver-assistance systems like blind spot monitoring, automatic emergency braking, or lane departure warning.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with an OBD-II scanner to identify the faulty sensor(s). Replacement of the malfunctioning sensor(s) or module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per sensor/module, depending on the specific component and labor costs.

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery dies quickly, especially when the car is not being driven for a few days. The car may have trouble starting or not start at all.
    * Solution: Replace the battery and test the system for parasitic draws.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$350+

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear liftgate has trouble staying up, or does not stay up at all
    * Solution: Replace the liftgate struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues (Jamming, Not Opening/Closing Properly)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof gets stuck, makes unusual noises during operation, or fails to open or close completely.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the sunroof tracks and mechanism for debris or damage. Cleaning, lubrication, or replacement of faulty components (e.g., motor, tracks).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the complexity of the repair

**Summary**

The 2021 Nissan X-Trail can present some notable issues. Engine problems, particularly excessive oil consumption, can be costly to repair. CVT issues are also a significant concern, with potential for expensive replacements. Electrical glitches, especially with the infotainment system and advanced driver-assistance features, can be frustrating. While the X-Trail offers comfort and convenience, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the possibility of costly repairs.
