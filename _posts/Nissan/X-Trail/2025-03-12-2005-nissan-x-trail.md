The 2005 Nissan X-Trail is a compact SUV that was well-regarded for its practicality, comfortable ride, and available all-wheel-drive system. Engine options for the 2005 X-Trail included a 2.0L inline-4 (QR20DE) producing around 140 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L inline-4 (QR25DE) making approximately 165 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level. Some owners appreciated the X-Trail's spacious interior and off-road capability, while others found the fuel economy to be lackluster and the interior styling somewhat dated.
