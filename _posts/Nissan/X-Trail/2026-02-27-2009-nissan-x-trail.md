### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Nissan X-Trail is generally considered a reliable vehicle, especially for its class and age. The petrol engines, while susceptible to oil consumption and potential head gasket issues on the 2.5L, are robust if maintained. The diesel engine's main concerns revolve around emissions systems like the DPF and EGR. Transmissions, particularly the CVT, require diligent fluid maintenance to prevent issues. Suspension components like bushings can wear, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins are not widespread but window regulators and instrument clusters can be points of failure. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, with regular maintenance and attention to common issues, the 2009 X-Trail can be a dependable choice.
