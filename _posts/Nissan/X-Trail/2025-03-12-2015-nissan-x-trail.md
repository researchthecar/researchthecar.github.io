The 2015 Nissan X-Trail, also known as the Rogue in some markets, is a compact crossover SUV that offers practicality and fuel efficiency. In many markets, the primary engine option is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate its spacious interior and comfortable ride, while others have noted concerns about the performance of the CVT and some electronic features. Common complaints often revolve around the reliability of the CVT, and some issues with the electronic systems.
