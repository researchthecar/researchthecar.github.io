The 2007 Nissan X-Trail is a compact SUV known for its practicality and off-road capabilities (depending on the trim). The X-Trail came with a few different engine options depending on the market, but the most common engine in many markets was a 2.5L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 169 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque. Other available engines included a 2.0L gasoline engine and a 2.0L diesel engine. Transmission options generally included a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission with some markets offering a CVT. Owners often praise the X-Trail for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available all-wheel-drive system. Common dislikes include fuel economy and some reports of reliability issues.

**Summary**
The 2007 Nissan X-Trail, while generally a practical SUV, has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly excessive oil consumption and timing chain issues on the 2.5L engine, can be costly to address. Transmission issues, especially slipping and harsh shifting in the automatic transmissions (especially CVT's), are also prevalent. Suspension issues can lead to ride and handling concerns. Electrically, window switch and alternator failures are common. Dashboard cracking is a common cosmetic issue. Rust can be a problem in certain climates. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but it's essential to have the vehicle inspected thoroughly before purchase.
