The 2008 Nissan X-Trail is a compact SUV offering a blend of practicality and ruggedness. Engine options for this model year typically include a 2.0-liter inline-4 gasoline engine (around 140 hp and 140 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.5-liter inline-4 gasoline engine (around 169 hp and 172 lb-ft of torque). Transmission choices usually consist of a 6-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), depending on the engine and trim level. Owners often appreciate the X-Trail for its spacious interior and off-road capabilities. Common dislikes include the fuel economy of the larger engine and reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**
*   **No Issues Found**

**2.5L Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.5L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored and addressed. Symptoms can include the need to frequently add oil, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: The solution varies based on the cause. Piston ring replacement is a common fix, but valve stem seals and PCV valve replacement are also possibilities. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission can experience issues such as slipping, shuddering, erratic shifting, and complete failure. These symptoms often arise due to overheating and degradation of the transmission fluid over time.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change might temporarily alleviate minor issues. However, more severe problems usually require complete transmission replacement or rebuild.

**Summary**

The 2008 Nissan X-Trail has some common issues. The 2.5L engine can suffer from excessive oil consumption, and the CVT transmission is prone to failure, both of which can be costly repairs. Suspension wear and electrical issues such as window motor failures are also problems to watch out for. The overall reliability of the vehicle can vary, and potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and check the vehicle's maintenance history carefully before purchasing.
