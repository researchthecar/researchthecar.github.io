The 2023 Nissan Ariya is an all-electric crossover SUV, marking Nissan's re-entry into the EV market after the Leaf. It comes in several configurations, differing primarily in battery size and whether it's front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (e-4ORCE). The FWD models offer either a 63 kWh or 87 kWh battery, delivering around 214-238 horsepower and 221-266 lb-ft of torque, depending on the trim. The e-4ORCE AWD models also come with either the 63 kWh or 87 kWh battery, boosting output to around 335-389 horsepower and 413-442 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Ariya's stylish design, comfortable ride, and well-appointed interior. Criticisms frequently revolve around software glitches, charging inconsistencies, and a higher price point compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2023 Nissan Ariya faces some common issues, primarily centered around its electrical systems and software. The most prevalent complaints relate to the infotainment system, software glitches, and inconsistent power delivery.

Other issues, such as panel gaps and interior noises, are less severe but can impact the overall ownership experience. The cost to rectify these issues, outside of warranty, can range from relatively minor for software fixes to more substantial for hardware replacements, such as the charging port or 12V battery.
