These events can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose. Some owners have stated that this seems to happen more frequently in cold weather.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the issue has been traced to software glitches requiring a reflash of the vehicle's control modules. Some owners have stated that the 12V battery was defective and needed to be replaced.
