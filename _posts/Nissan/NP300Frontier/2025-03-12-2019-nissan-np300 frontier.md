**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Gasoline**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the engine consuming a large amount of oil between oil changes, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. Visible blue smoke may be emitted from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings and potentially the pistons themselves can mitigate the oil consumption issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and required repairs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Inline-4 Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and black smoke from the exhaust. Diagnostic codes indicate injector malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors. It's recommended to replace all injectors at the same time for optimal performance and reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $2,000+ depending on how many injectors are replaced and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**
