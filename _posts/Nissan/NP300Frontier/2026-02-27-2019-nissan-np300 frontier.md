### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Nissan NP300 Frontier demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly for its intended purpose as a rugged work vehicle. The diesel engine option, while powerful, can be susceptible to DPF-related issues, especially if used primarily for short trips where regeneration cycles are incomplete. Turbocharger failures, though not extremely common, are a potential concern. The automatic transmission may exhibit some harsh shifting characteristics over time. Suspension components, specifically leaf springs, can wear out under heavy use. Electrical issues like battery drain are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and type. Overall, the NP300 Frontier is a dependable truck, but owners should be mindful of diesel emissions system maintenance and potential wear on suspension components under demanding conditions.
