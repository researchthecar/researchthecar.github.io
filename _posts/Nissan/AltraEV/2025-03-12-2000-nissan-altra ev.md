The 2000 Nissan Altra EV was an early attempt at an all-electric vehicle. This model used a lithium-ion battery pack, a relative novelty at the time, and delivered around 83 horsepower. People who enjoyed the Altra EV often cited its smooth and quiet operation as a major benefit. Downsides included limited range, long charging times, and the inevitable battery degradation that comes with age. Due to its limited production run and age, parts can be difficult to find, and qualified technicians even more so.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint is a significant reduction in the vehicle's range compared to its original specifications. This is due to the degradation of the lithium-ion battery pack over time. The car originally had a range of 80-100 miles, and owners are now only getting 40-60 miles.
    *   Solution: Battery pack replacement is the only long-term solution. Individual modules can sometimes be replaced, but matching the voltage and capacity of the other modules can be difficult.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The BMS controls the charging and discharging of the battery pack, as well as monitors the individual cell voltages and temperatures. When it fails, it can cause premature aging of the batteries or prevent the car from charging.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the BMS module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Charger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The onboard charger is a common point of failure. This can manifest as the car not charging, charging very slowly, or displaying error messages.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the onboard charger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **DC-DC Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DC-DC converter steps down the high voltage from the battery pack to 12V to power the vehicle's accessories. A failing converter can cause the lights to dim, the radio to cut out, and the car to not start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the DC-DC converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Bushings and Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Given the vehicle's age, expect worn suspension bushings and ball joints. Symptoms include clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings and ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic dashboard is prone to cracking due to age and sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can form on the body panels, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Body work and painting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Nissan Altra EV is a unique piece of automotive history, but prospective owners should be aware of the common issues associated with its age and technology. The most significant concern is the battery pack, which will likely require replacement at a considerable cost. Electrical component failures are also common and can be expensive to repair. Suspension issues and rust are typical for a vehicle of this age. Overall, maintaining an Altra EV can be costly and challenging, requiring a commitment to finding specialized parts and expertise.
