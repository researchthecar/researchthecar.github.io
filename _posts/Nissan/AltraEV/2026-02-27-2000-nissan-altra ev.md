# 2000 Nissan Altra EV

### Overview
The 2000 Nissan Altra EV was a pioneering electric vehicle, representing an early foray into mass-produced electric cars. As such, its reliability data is unique, focusing on the specific challenges and successes of early EV technology rather than traditional internal combustion engine components. While the Altra EV aimed to provide a sustainable transportation option, its limited production run and the nascent state of EV infrastructure and battery technology at the time mean that its reliability profile differs significantly from contemporary gasoline-powered vehicles. This analysis focuses on documented issues specific to its electric powertrain and associated systems.

### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Nissan Altra EV, being an early electric vehicle, exhibits reliability concerns primarily centered around its battery technology and associated electrical components. While the electric motor and transmission are generally robust, the Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery pack is prone to degradation over time, leading to reduced range and performance, with replacement being a significant expense. Charging system faults and inverter issues are also noted, reflecting the complexities of early EV electrical architectures. Other categories like suspension, exterior, and interior show no widespread reported issues, suggesting that the core vehicle structure and non-powertrain components were reasonably well-built for their time. Prospective owners should be aware of the potential costs associated with battery health and electrical system maintenance.
