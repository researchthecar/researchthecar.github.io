The 2020 Nissan Versa (V-Drive is not a trim level in the US market) is a subcompact sedan known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It typically comes equipped with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 122 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate its spacious interior for its class, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. Common criticisms include its somewhat underpowered engine and basic interior materials.
