The 2022 Nissan Versa, also known as the V-Drive in some markets, is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It typically comes equipped with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 122 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. This engine is usually paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission (more rare) or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Versa for its comfortable ride, spacious interior for its class, and good fuel economy. Common complaints include the relatively low power output, basic interior materials, and the sometimes-unpredictable nature of the CVT.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 Cylinder**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, visible blue smoke from the exhaust (though rare), and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: The first step is usually to monitor oil consumption carefully and document the amount of oil added. A compression test and leak-down test can help determine if there is internal engine damage causing the oil consumption. Depending on the cause, the fix could range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, or in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerking, hesitation, or shuddering during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to find the right gear ratio.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change with Nissan NS-3 CVT fluid is the first line of defense. If the problem persists, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) might be necessary. In more severe cases, a valve body replacement or even a full CVT replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $5000+ depending on the complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the struts and shocks wear out quicker than expected, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased road noise. This is especially noticeable on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and shocks with new units. Consider upgrading to aftermarket options for improved durability and performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ depending on the quality of parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer is the initial recommended fix. If the issue persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Vibration from Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling or vibration noises coming from the dashboard, especially when driving on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing the loose components. This may involve adding padding or tightening screws behind the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Nissan Versa, while generally reliable, does have some common issues owners may encounter. The most concerning issues involve the CVT transmission and potential engine oil consumption. Suspension components may also wear prematurely, while electrical issues, such as infotainment system glitches and interior rattles are relatively minor annoyances. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity. The cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage.
