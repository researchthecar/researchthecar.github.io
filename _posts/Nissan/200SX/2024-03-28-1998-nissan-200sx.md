**Introduction**

The 1998 Nissan 200SX is a sports coupe known for its stylish design, nimble handling, and decent performance. It's powered by a 2.0-liter SR20DET turbocharged engine that produces 205 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. While well-loved by enthusiasts, the 200SX also has a few common issues to watch out for.

**Engine**

**SR20DET**

* **Turbocharger failure:** Premature wear or leaks in the turbocharger can lead to reduced power, excessive oil consumption, and in severe cases, engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Head gasket failure:** Worn or deteriorated head gaskets can cause coolant and oil leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the head gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** A faulty timing chain tensioner can lead to a stretched or skipped timing chain, resulting in engine misfires, rough idling, and potentially catastrophic engine failure.
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner and timing chain.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** Premature wear or slippage in the clutch can make it difficult to engage gears, resulting in rough shifts and loss of power.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,000
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Transmission gear grinding:** Worn or damaged transmission gears can lead to difficulty shifting, grinding noises, and potential transmission failure.
    * Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** Worn or damaged internal components can cause the transmission to slip gears, resulting in reduced power and difficulty accelerating.
    * Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Transmission fluid leaks:** Worn or damaged seals or gaskets can lead to transmission fluid leaks, which can cause overheating and transmission failure if not addressed.
