The 2004 Nissan Tsubame is a compact sedan primarily sold in Mexico. It's essentially a rebadged Nissan Sentra/Tsuru. It was known for its simplicity, reliability, and affordability. A popular engine option was the 1.6L inline-4 cylinder engine, producing approximately 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. The Tsubame typically came equipped with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated its fuel efficiency and ease of maintenance, but disliked its basic features and somewhat dated design.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual increase in oil consumption over time, often noticed during routine oil checks. May be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust, indicating oil burning in the combustion chamber.
    *   Solution: Inspect valve stem seals and piston rings for wear or damage. Replacement of these components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic idling, stalling, or difficulty starting the engine. The IAC valve regulates airflow to maintain a stable idle speed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement of gears, slipping during acceleration, or harsh/erratic shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush may help in some cases, but often requires a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 (fluid flush) - $1500+ (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Reduced handling precision and stability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and increased braking distance. Visual inspection may reveal leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Nissan Tsubame, while generally reliable, can experience issues common to vehicles of its age. Engine-related problems like oil consumption and IAC valve failure, transmission issues like slipping, and suspension wear are relatively common. Electrical problems with the alternator and power windows can also occur. Rust can be a significant concern, particularly in certain climates. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly is crucial for maintaining the vehicle's reliability and safety.
