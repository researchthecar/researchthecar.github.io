**Introduction:**

The 2003 Nissan Tsubame is a compact SUV available with either a 2.5L V6 engine or a 3.5L V6 engine, paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5L V6 produces 170 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.5L V6 produces 240 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. The vehicle is praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordable price. However, it has faced some common issues with its components.

**Engine**

**2.5L V6**

* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to skip and potentially damaging the engine. Symptoms include engine rattling, loss of power, and check engine light illumination. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner and timing chain. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $1,500
* **Oil consumption:** Some vehicles may experience excessive oil consumption, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. The cause is often worn piston rings or valve seals. The solution is to replace the affected parts. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,500

**3.5L V6**

* **Intake valve carbon buildup:** Carbon deposits can accumulate on the intake valves over time, reducing airflow and engine performance. Symptoms include reduced power, fuel efficiency, and hesitation during acceleration. The solution is to clean the intake valves and manifold. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $600

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual**

* **Difficulty shifting gears:** Some vehicles may experience difficulty shifting gears, especially when cold. The cause is often worn or loose shift linkage or synchros. The solution is to adjust or replace the affected components. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500

**4-speed Automatic**

* **Slipping transmission:** The transmission may slip or hesitate during gear changes, indicating internal transmission issues. The cause can be worn or damaged clutches, bands, or solenoids. The solution is to repair or replace the affected components. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $3,000
