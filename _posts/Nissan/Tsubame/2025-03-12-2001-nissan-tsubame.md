The 2001 Nissan Tsubame, also known as the Nissan AD Van in some markets, was a compact commercial vehicle known for its practicality and reliability. It was available with a 1.3L GA13DE I4 engine producing around 82 horsepower and 77 lb-ft of torque, or a 1.5L QG15DE I4 engine producing around 105 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were generally a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners typically appreciated the Tsubame for its fuel efficiency and cargo capacity, while some common complaints centered around its basic features and somewhat dated styling, along with weak performance with the 1.3L engine when fully loaded.
