The 2002 Nissan Tsubame, primarily sold in Mexico, was a versatile and economical vehicle, offering a blend of practicality and affordability. It was essentially a rebadged Nissan Sentra B15, known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. The Tsubame was available with a 1.6-liter inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 105 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8-liter inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 126 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission was standard, with an optional 4-speed automatic transmission available for both engine options. Drivers appreciated its fuel efficiency, ease of maintenance, and spacious interior for its class. However, some owners found the performance to be lacking, particularly when fully loaded. The car's basic features and relatively simple design also meant it lacked some of the comforts and technology found in newer vehicles.
