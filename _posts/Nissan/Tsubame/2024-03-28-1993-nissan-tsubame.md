**Introduction to the 1993 Nissan Tsubame**

The 1993 Nissan Tsubame is a compact sedan that was available with two engine and transmission options: a 1.8L 4-cylinder engine paired with a 5-speed manual transmission and a 2.0L V6 engine paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 1.8L engine produced 125 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.0L V6 produced 155 horsepower and 159 lb-ft of torque. The Tsubame was praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and sporty handling, but it was also criticized for its lack of power with the 1.8L engine and its cramped interior.
