**Introduction:**

The 1995 Nissan Tsubame was a compact sports car that was only available in Japan. It featured a lightweight chassis and a powerful engine, making it a popular choice for enthusiasts. The Tsubame was offered with two engine options: a 1.8-liter naturally aspirated engine producing 140 horsepower and a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine producing 205 horsepower. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed manual transmission.

**Engine**

**1.8-liter Naturally Aspirated Engine**

* **Cam Phasor System Failure:** The cam phasor system is responsible for adjusting the timing of the intake and exhaust camshafts. When it fails, it can cause a loss of power and fuel economy.
    * Symptoms: Reduced power, poor fuel economy, engine knocking
    * Solution: Replace the cam phasor system
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0-liter Turbocharged Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger is responsible for providing boost pressure to the engine. When it fails, it can cause a significant loss of power.
    * Symptoms: Loss of power, smoke from the exhaust, whistling sound
    * Solution: Replace the turbocharger
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

* **5-Speed Manual Transmission:**

* **Synchronizer Wear:** The synchronizers help to match the speed of the transmission gears when shifting. When they wear out, it can make it difficult or impossible to shift gears.
    * Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, grinding noise when shifting
    * Solution: Replace the synchronizers
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator is responsible for charging the battery and providing power to the electrical system. When it fails, it can cause the battery to drain and the vehicle to lose power.
    * Symptoms: Dimming lights, difficulty starting the vehicle, warning light on the dashboard
    * Solution: Replace the alternator
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+

**Summary:**

The 1995 Nissan Tsubame is a reliable and fun-to-drive sports car. However, it is not without its issues. The most common problems include cam phasor system failure, turbocharger failure, synchronizer wear, front strut mount failure, alternator failure, sunroof leak, heater core leak, and climate control unit failure. While these issues can be expensive to fix, they are not particularly severe and should not deter potential buyers from considering the Tsubame.
