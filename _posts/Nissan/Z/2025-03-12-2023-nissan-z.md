The 2023 Nissan Z marks the return of a beloved sports car, powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 engine producing 400 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. It is available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its retro-inspired design, powerful engine, and improved handling compared to its predecessor. Some criticisms include the interior materials not feeling premium enough for the price point and some early production quality control issues.
