The 2017 Nissan Rogue Sport is a compact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability. It comes exclusively with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate its comfortable ride and ample cargo space for its size. However, some common criticisms include sluggish acceleration and a somewhat unrefined CVT experience.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights, engine knocking sounds due to low lubrication, and potential engine damage if not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and topping off as needed can mitigate immediate risks. A more permanent solution may involve replacing piston rings or potentially the entire engine block, depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and chosen solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can occur due to faulty ignition coils or spark plugs. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cylinder experiencing the misfire. Replace the affected ignition coil and/or spark plug.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per cylinder
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Juddering/Shaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience a juddering or shaking sensation, especially during acceleration from a stop or at low speeds. This is often attributed to wear and tear on the CVT belt or issues with the valve body.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change *might* alleviate the issue in some cases, but often the underlying problem requires more extensive repairs or a CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300 (CVT fluid change), $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining noise emanating from the transmission, particularly during acceleration. This can indicate internal wear within the CVT.
    *   Solution: Similar to juddering, fluid changes may offer temporary relief, but typically a CVT replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the struts and shocks wear out more quickly than expected, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts and shocks with new units. Consider upgrading to aftermarket options for improved durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component that is not shutting off properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replace the faulty component. Also, test the battery and replace if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Backup Camera**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Backup camera displaying a distorted image, failing to activate, or showing a black screen.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. If the connections are good, the camera unit itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may become stuck open or closed, make excessive noise during operation, or leak water into the cabin.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the malfunction. This may involve cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks, replacing the sunroof motor, or repairing damaged seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Nissan Rogue Sport has some reliability concerns, particularly related to the CVT transmission and potential oil consumption issues in the engine. These issues can be costly to repair, with CVT replacements potentially reaching upwards of $5,000. Electrical and suspension issues, while less severe, can also add to the overall cost of ownership. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
