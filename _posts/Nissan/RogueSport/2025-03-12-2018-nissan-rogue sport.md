The 2018 Nissan Rogue Sport is a compact crossover SUV known for its maneuverability and fuel efficiency. It comes equipped with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine that produces 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate its comfortable ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and ample cargo space for its class. However, some common criticisms include its lackluster acceleration and occasional CVT-related concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.0L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights, engine knocking or rattling, and blue smoke emitting from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the severity. A simple fix could be replacing the PCV valve. More complex fixes include piston ring replacement, or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported the engine stalling while driving.
    *   Solution: Often involves a software update to the ECM (Engine Control Module) or replacement of faulty sensors, like the mass airflow sensor or crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported experiencing jerking, hesitation, or shuddering during acceleration or deceleration, especially at lower speeds. Some have described it as a "rubber band" effect.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change using Nissan NS-3 fluid can alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, the CVT valve body or even the entire CVT unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or buzzing sound emanating from the transmission area, especially during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Typically indicates internal wear or damage within the CVT. Fluid changes may temporarily mask the sound, but replacement or rebuilding of the CVT is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear of struts, shocks, and bushings. Symptoms include excessive bouncing, poor handling, and clunking noises coming from the suspension when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially when the vehicle is not driven for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Could be due to a parasitic drain caused by a faulty module or accessory. Requires diagnostic testing to identify the source of the drain, followed by repair or replacement of the faulty component. A new battery may also be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive, requiring a restart.
    *   Solution: Software updates, or replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous activation of the AEB system, even in the absence of obstacles, leading to sudden and unexpected braking.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to identify sensor issues or calibration problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blows warm air or fails to cool the cabin effectively. This could be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Leak detection and repair, compressor replacement, or blend door actuator replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Nissan Rogue Sport, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The most prevalent concerns revolve around the CVT, with reports of jerking, hesitation, and whining noises. Excessive oil consumption and electrical issues are also reported. Suspension components may wear prematurely in some cases. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to costly repairs, particularly if the CVT requires replacement. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect the vehicle, including a thorough test drive, before purchasing.
