The 2021 Nissan Rogue Sport is a compact SUV offering a balance of practicality and affordability. It comes equipped with a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate the Rogue Sport's comfortable ride, maneuverability, and user-friendly infotainment system.
