The 2022 Nissan Rogue Sport is a compact SUV known for its comfortable ride, user-friendly technology, and fuel efficiency. It comes with a single engine option: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While owners generally appreciate its nimble handling and ease of parking, some common complaints include underpowered acceleration, a somewhat dated interior design, and limited cargo space compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Engine**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.0L engine consuming more oil than expected between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and the need for more frequent oil top-offs. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently than normal, blue smoke from the exhaust (though not always present), and a low oil level warning light.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and topping off as needed is a temporary solution. A permanent fix might involve replacing valve stem seals or piston rings, depending on the severity of the issue and what is causing the problem. In some cases, the entire engine may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the root cause and repair needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
* **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be caused by the CVT struggling to find the optimal gear ratio or due to issues with the CVT's internal components.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update or CVT reset can resolve the issue. However, more severe cases may require CVT replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update/Reset) - $4,000+ (CVT Replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, lags, or crashes, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    * Solution: A software update is often the first step. If the problem persists, replacing the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $800+ (Infotainment Unit Replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Backup Camera Malfunction**
     * Description/Symptoms: The backup camera image is distorted, blurry, or sometimes fails to display altogether.
     * Solution: Check the camera lens for dirt or obstructions. If the problem persists, the camera unit or wiring may need to be replaced.
     * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the issue and if wiring needs to be replaced).
     * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) System Errors**
    * Description/Symptoms: False AEB activations, AEB system failure warnings, or complete AEB system failure.
    * Solution: Check the front sensor for damage or obstructions. A software update can sometimes address sensor calibration issues. If hardware is failing, replacement of a sensor or AEB module may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1000+ (replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattling or squeaking noises coming from various interior parts, such as the dashboard, door panels, or seats.
    * Solution: Locating the source of the noise and tightening or padding the affected area. This can be a DIY fix or require professional attention.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY) - $200+ (Professional Repair).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Nissan Rogue Sport generally provides a reliable driving experience, but some owners have reported issues, including excessive oil consumption and CVT issues, which can range from minor inconveniences to costly repairs. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and backup camera are also common complaints. While some of these issues can be resolved with software updates or minor repairs, others may require more extensive and expensive fixes. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
