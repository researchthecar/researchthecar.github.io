The 2019 Nissan Rogue Sport is a compact SUV known for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency, and ample cargo space. It's powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). What people generally appreciate about the Rogue Sport is its maneuverability, good gas mileage, and user-friendly technology. Criticisms often include the engine's lack of power, especially when fully loaded, and the droning sound of the CVT during acceleration.
