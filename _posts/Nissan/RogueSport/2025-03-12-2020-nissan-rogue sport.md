The 2020 Nissan Rogue Sport is a compact SUV known for its maneuverability and fuel efficiency, making it a popular choice for urban drivers. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate its comfortable ride and ample cargo space for its size, while some common complaints revolve around the engine's lackluster acceleration and the CVT's characteristic drone under heavy load.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (MR20DE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as the "low oil" warning light illuminating, or noticing a significant drop on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address any leaks promptly. For excessive consumption, a mechanic may recommend an engine flush, changing to a higher viscosity oil, or, in severe cases, engine repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil flush) to $3,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be described as a momentary lag in power delivery followed by a sudden surge. The transmission may also exhibit unusual noises, such as whining or humming.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealership may help to recalibrate the transmission's behavior. In some cases, a CVT fluid flush or replacement may be required. In severe cases, transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) to $300 (fluid flush) to $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports indicate some 2020 Rogue Sports experience premature wear in the front struts, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. Noises like clunking or rattling from the front suspension are also common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts. It is generally recommended to replace struts in pairs (both front or both rear) to maintain balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 (per pair, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle sits unused for several days. This can result in difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Have a mechanic perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the battery drain. Possible causes include a faulty module, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (diagnostic) to $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain and the parts required)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Malfunctioning Blind Spot Monitoring System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure or intermittent operation of the blind spot monitoring (BSM) system. The warning light may illuminate even when there are no vehicles in the blind spot, or the system may fail to alert the driver to vehicles in the blind spot.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician to determine the cause of the failure. Possible causes include a faulty sensor, wiring issues, or a software glitch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AEB system may engage unnecessarily, even when there is no obstacle in front of the vehicle. This can be a sudden and unexpected braking event, which is potentially dangerous.
    *   Solution: A software update or recalibration of the AEB system by the dealership. In some cases, a faulty sensor may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (software update/recalibration) to $300 - $800+ (sensor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect access to navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the infotainment system by holding down the power button for several seconds. A software update from the dealership may also resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) to $100 - $200 (software update) to $500 - $1500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Nissan Rogue Sport generally provides a reliable driving experience; however, it is susceptible to certain issues. Engine oil consumption and CVT transmission hesitations and jerking are commonly reported. Suspension wear and electrical issues are also a concern. Repairs can range from relatively inexpensive software updates or fluid changes to more costly engine or transmission replacements. Prior to purchasing, it is recommended to have a qualified mechanic inspect the vehicle and check for any outstanding recalls or technical service bulletins.
