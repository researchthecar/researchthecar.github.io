The 2021 Nissan NV1500 is a full-size cargo van known for its practicality and ample interior space. The NV1500 comes standard with a 4.0-liter V6 engine producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 5.6-liter V8 engine is also available, delivering 375 horsepower and 387 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the NV1500's spacious cargo area, comfortable front seats, and relatively affordable price point. However, some common complaints include the van's unrefined driving experience, dated interior design, and relatively poor fuel economy.

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or "jerk" when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve this issue. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required to check for worn or damaged internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update may be covered under warranty or cost around $100-$200. Further diagnostics and repairs can range from $500 to $3000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. The leaf springs are a common culprit.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the leaf spring bushings and contact points with a silicone-based lubricant can often resolve the squeaking. In more severe cases, replacing the leaf spring bushings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Lubrication can be done DIY or cost around $50-100 at a shop. Replacing bushings can range from $200-$500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dead Battery/Electrical Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature battery drain or experiencing a dead battery, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently. This can be caused by parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw is crucial. This may involve testing various circuits and components to pinpoint the cause. Potential culprits include faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or malfunctioning modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnostics can range from $100-$300. Repair costs will vary widely depending on the source of the drain, potentially ranging from $50 to $500+. Replacing the battery can range from $150-$300.

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the sliding door mechanism, including difficulty opening or closing the door, sticking, or unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the sliding door tracks and rollers can often resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, the sliding door motor, cables, or other components may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Lubrication can be done DIY. Repair costs can range from $200-$1000+ depending on the component needing repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary:**

The 2021 Nissan NV1500, while generally reliable, has some reported issues. The harsh transmission shifting can be an annoyance and potentially lead to more significant problems. Electrical issues leading to battery drain can be frustrating, while suspension squeaks and sliding door problems detract from the overall driving experience. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix (lubricating the leaf springs, for instance), electrical problems could be more costly to diagnose and resolve. Most issues seem to be minor and may not affect every vehicle, making it an otherwise dependable choice for a cargo van.
