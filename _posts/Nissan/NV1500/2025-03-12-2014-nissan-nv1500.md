The 2014 Nissan NV1500 is a full-size cargo van designed for commercial use, offering a spacious interior and robust build. This model year offered a choice of a 4.0L V6 engine producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque or a 5.6L V8 engine producing 317 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the NV1500 for its reliability, large cargo capacity, and comfortable seating for long drives. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, handling characteristics when unloaded, and the relatively basic interior features compared to newer vans.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise from the front of the engine, especially on startup. This indicates wear or stretching of the timing chain.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from various engine seals, most commonly the valve cover gaskets or the front timing cover. Visible oil drips under the vehicle, or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on location of leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.6L V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise that gets louder when the engine is cold, diminishing once warmed up. This is a sign of a crack in the exhaust manifold, usually near the welds.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the solution may involve replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. In more severe cases, engine replacement or rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the cause and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifting between gears, particularly noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be needed, potentially involving valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs higher than normal without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This indicates the transmission is slipping internally.
    *   Solution: May require a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**

    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing or swaying of the front end, uneven tire wear, or clunking noises from the front suspension. This suggests worn or damaged front struts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery dies prematurely, requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic draw. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty door switches, or failing modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated (check engine light) due to faulty sensors such as oxygen sensors or mass airflow sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan NV1500, while generally reliable, is prone to certain issues as it ages. The most significant problems revolve around the engine (timing chain rattle and oil leaks in the V6, exhaust manifold issues and oil consumption in the V8) and transmission (rough shifting and slipping). Suspension issues like leaf spring sagging are also common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. Owners should be aware of these potential problems and proactively address them to maintain the vehicle's longevity and reliability.
