The 2013 Nissan NV1500 is a full-size cargo van that was introduced as a more comfortable and refined alternative to traditional commercial vans. The NV1500 offered two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque and a 5.6L V8 producing 317 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the NV1500 for its comfortable seating, car-like handling, and ample cargo space. Common complaints include subpar fuel economy, limited aftermarket support, and some reliability concerns.
