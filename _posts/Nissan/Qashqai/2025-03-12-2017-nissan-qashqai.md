The 2017 Nissan Qashqai, known as the Rogue Sport in some markets, is a compact SUV that offers a blend of practicality and fuel efficiency. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder gasoline engine producing approximately 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. It is predominantly paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Qashqai's comfortable ride and nimble handling. However, some common criticisms include lackluster acceleration and potential reliability concerns, particularly with the CVT.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder Gasoline Engine**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or noticeable oil loss without visible leaks.
    * Solution: The solution varies, starting with more frequent monitoring of oil levels. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement of piston rings may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can cause the vehicle to run rough, experience a loss of power, and the check engine light may illuminate.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the misfire with an OBDII scanner and addressing the issue. Potential causes include faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the affected component and labor involved.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
* **CVT Slippage/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: The CVT may exhibit slippage or hesitation during acceleration, especially at higher speeds or when climbing hills. This can feel like the engine is revving without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    * Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid flush and replacement can alleviate minor slippage. However, more severe cases may require a CVT replacement or rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5,000+, the flush being the lower cost and the replacement being the higher end.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CVT Juddering/Shaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported a juddering or shaking sensation, particularly during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. This can be more pronounced when the CVT is cold.
    * Solution: Performing a CVT fluid flush and replacement, if that doesn't address the problem, the CVT will need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5,000+, the flush being the lower cost and the replacement being the higher end.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Premature CVT Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced complete CVT failure at relatively low mileage. This can result in the vehicle being undrivable.
    * Solution: Replacement of the CVT unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Faulty Backup Camera**
    * Description/Symptoms: The backup camera display may become blurry, distorted, or completely fail to function.
    * Solution: Replacing the backup camera unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the cost of the new camera and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the vehicle's battery draining prematurely, leading to difficulty starting the engine. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component that continues to draw power when the vehicle is off.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component. This may involve testing various electrical circuits to identify the culprit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the complexity of the electrical issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks may appear on the dashboard surface, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight and heat.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard, or use of a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $1,500+ (dashboard replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sunroof Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, particularly during heavy rain, originating from the sunroof area.
    * Solution: Cleaning the sunroof drains, replacing the sunroof seal, or repairing the sunroof assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+, depending on the cause and extent of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Nissan Qashqai/Rogue Sport has a number of common issues. The most serious are the problems with the CVT, which can lead to costly repairs or replacements. Engine issues such as excessive oil consumption and misfires can also be problematic. Electrical issues are more of an inconvenience. While some interior issues like dashboard cracking can be addressed cosmetically, sunroof leaks require more immediate attention. The severity of these issues varies, and addressing them can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to costly component replacements.
