The 2018 Nissan Qashqai is a compact SUV that offers a blend of practicality, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability. The most common engine option for this model year is a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. This engine is primarily paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). People generally appreciate the Qashqai for its comfortable ride, nimble handling, and abundance of available technology features. Common dislikes include its somewhat underpowered engine and the sometimes-unpredictable behavior of the CVT.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption. Symptoms may include needing to add oil frequently between scheduled oil changes and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. In some cases, a repair involving piston rings or valve stem seals may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration, knocking noises, or engine movement during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed engine mount(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jutter/Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation, jerking, or shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This is often described as a "rubber banding" feeling.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid flush and software update may help. However, more severe cases may require CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400 for fluid flush and software update, $3,000 - $5,000+ for CVT replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure, inability to accelerate, loud noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the CVT.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, uneven tire wear, poor handling. This can include worn strut mounts, ball joints, or control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the components replaced and the labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery repeatedly drains, making it difficult or impossible to start the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This could involve faulty relays, sensors, or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated on the dashboard, accompanied by various symptoms depending on the affected sensor (e.g., erratic engine performance, transmission shifting issues, ABS or stability control malfunctions).
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is failing and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor, including diagnosis and replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature rust formation, especially in areas prone to salt exposure (e.g., wheel wells, rocker panels).
    *   Solution: Rust repair, which may include sanding, priming, painting, or panel replacement. Applying rust protection measures, such as undercoating, can help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+, depending on the severity of the rust damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air from the A/C system. Possible causes include refrigerant leaks, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the A/C system. This may involve recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, or repairing the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,200+, depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Nissan Qashqai can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly those related to the CVT transmission and excessive oil consumption with the 2.0L engine. Electrical issues and suspension wear are also areas to inspect. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major transmission or engine repairs. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify potential problems early.
