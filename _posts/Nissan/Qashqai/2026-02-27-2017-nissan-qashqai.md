### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Nissan Qashqai generally presents a good reliability profile, particularly with its petrol engines and manual transmissions. The CVT automatic, while convenient, has a higher propensity for issues like hesitations or jerking, often requiring fluid changes or more involved repairs. Diesel variants can encounter DPF problems, a common concern for modern diesels, especially if driven primarily on short city journeys. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and keyless entry problems, are also reported by a segment of owners. Overall, the Qashqai is a dependable choice for many, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and consider the vehicle's service history, especially for diesel and CVT models.
