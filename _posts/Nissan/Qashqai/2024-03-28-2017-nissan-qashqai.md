**Introduction**
The 2017 Nissan Qashqai is a compact crossover SUV that is offered with two different engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 2.0-liter inline-4 that produces 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. The upgraded engine is a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 that produces 167 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Qashqai has received praise for its comfortable interior, good fuel economy, and affordable price. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of power, especially with the base engine.
