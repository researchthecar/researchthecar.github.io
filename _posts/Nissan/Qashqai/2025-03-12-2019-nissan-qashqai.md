The 2019 Nissan Qashqai, also known as the Rogue Sport in North America, is a compact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability. In the United States, it was offered with a single engine option: a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Qashqai's nimble handling and comfortable ride, but some criticisms include the relatively slow acceleration and occasional issues with the CVT.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can manifest as the need to add a quart of oil every 1,000-2,000 miles.  Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may also be observed.
    * Solution: The solution varies depending on the root cause. It could involve replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or in severe cases, the entire engine. A compression test can help diagnose the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and chosen repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Juddering/Shuddering**
    * Description/Symptoms: A common complaint is juddering, shaking or shuddering, especially during acceleration from a stop or at low speeds. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to find the right gear.
    * Solution: A CVT fluid change *may* temporarily alleviate the issue. However, in many cases, the CVT needs to be replaced or rebuilt.  Some owners have reported success with software updates (if available), but this is not a guaranteed fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (CVT replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CVT Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure. Loss of drive, inability to accelerate, and potentially loud noises emanating from the transmission.  Warning lights may illuminate on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Typically requires a full transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the struts and shocks wear out faster than expected, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, particularly over bumps. Noises (clunking or squeaking) may also be heard.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn struts and/or shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car is left unused for a few days, even with no lights left on. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    * Solution: Diagnosing parasitic drain. Potential culprits include faulty door switches, malfunctioning relays, or aftermarket accessories.  Replacing the battery is sometimes necessary if it has been deeply discharged repeatedly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Malfunctioning Infotainment System**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen may freeze, glitch, or become unresponsive. Bluetooth connectivity issues and problems with the navigation system are also reported.
    * Solution: Attempting a system reset. Software updates from Nissan might be available. In severe cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/update) - $1,000+ (replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    * Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces, especially when driving on rough roads.
    * Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and applying padding or shims to secure the loose components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Nissan Qashqai presents a mixed bag of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the CVT transmission, which can exhibit juddering and, in some cases, outright failure. Engine oil consumption is another noteworthy issue that can be costly to address. Other problems like suspension wear, electrical gremlins, and interior rattles are less severe but can still detract from the ownership experience. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for a CVT replacement or engine overhaul. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the transmission for signs of issues and inquire about the vehicle's oil consumption history.
