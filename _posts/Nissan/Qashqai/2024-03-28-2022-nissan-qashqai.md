**Introduction to the 2022 Nissan Qashqai**

The 2022 Nissan Qashqai is a compact crossover SUV that offers a refined driving experience and a comfortable interior. It comes with a choice of two powertrain options: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 141 horsepower and 144 lb-ft of torque, or a 1.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 158 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

The Qashqai has received positive reviews for its spacious cabin, well-equipped interior, and efficient fuel consumption. However, it has also been criticized for its uninspiring performance, lack of engaging handling, and high price tag compared to its competitors.
