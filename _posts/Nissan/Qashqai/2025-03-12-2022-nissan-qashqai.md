The 2022 Nissan Qashqai (also known as the Rogue Sport in North America) is a compact crossover SUV that offers a blend of practicality and style.  The primary engine option for the 2022 model year is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. The engine is typically paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). People generally appreciate the Qashqai for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and compact size, making it easy to maneuver in urban environments. However, some criticisms include the relatively underpowered engine and the sometimes-unrefined nature of the CVT.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption between oil changes, requiring frequent top-ups. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the severity. A dealer may perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of loss. In some cases, replacing valve stem seals or piston rings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or pinging noises from the engine, especially during acceleration or when under load. This can be due to low-quality fuel, improper ignition timing, or carbon buildup.
    *   Solution: Try using higher octane fuel. A mechanic may need to diagnose and address the cause, which could involve cleaning the fuel injectors, adjusting the timing, or removing carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT may exhibit jerky acceleration or hesitation, especially from a stop or during low-speed maneuvers. This can feel like a lag in response when pressing the accelerator.
    *   Solution: A software update or recalibration of the CVT control module may help. In more severe cases, the CVT might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) - $4,000+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT may exhibit signs of slipping, where the engine revs up without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This can be especially noticeable when climbing hills or accelerating hard.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid change, CVT software recalibration, or CVT replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 (fluid change), $100 (for software update) - $4,000+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear or failure of the struts and shocks, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive, requiring a reset. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset or a software update, if available. In some cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for reset/update) - $500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera display may be distorted, blurry, or fail to activate.
    *   Solution: Check the camera lens for obstructions. Inspect the wiring harness for damage. The camera module might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces, especially when driving on uneven roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and secure the loose trim pieces using clips, foam padding, or adhesive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY fix) - $200+ (professional repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Nissan Qashqai can be a reliable vehicle, but it's crucial to be aware of potential issues. The most common complaints revolve around the engine's oil consumption, the CVT's performance, and the infotainment system's reliability. Suspension issues and interior rattles also appear. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely, ranging from minor software updates to potentially expensive CVT or engine replacements. Pre-purchase inspections are recommended to assess the vehicle's condition and identify any existing problems.
