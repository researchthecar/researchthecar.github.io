The 2021 Nissan Qashqai, also known as the Nissan Rogue Sport in the United States, is a compact crossover SUV. In most markets, it is only offered with a 2.0-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate its fuel efficiency and maneuverability, while common complaints revolve around its somewhat underpowered engine and occasionally frustrating CVT performance.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms may include the need to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles, a burning oil smell, or blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: In some cases, this may require replacing the piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of engine misfires, often accompanied by a check engine light. The code may indicate a specific cylinder misfire.
    * Solution: This could be caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs. Replacing the affected parts is the typical solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per cylinder
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Shuddering or Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported shuddering or hesitation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This is a common complaint with CVTs, and the Qashqai's is no exception. Some have described a feeling of the transmission "slipping" or not engaging properly.
    * Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the CVT may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200+ for software update; $3,000-$5,000+ for CVT replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CVT Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure. The vehicle may not move, or the transmission may make loud noises.
    * Solution: Full transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000-$5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear of suspension components, such as ball joints, control arm bushings, and struts/shocks. This can lead to noises (clunking, squeaking) over bumps and/or compromised handling.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per component, depending on the location and complexity
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle sits unused for several days. This may be due to a parasitic drain.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the drain and repair or replace the faulty component. A new battery may also be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the source of the drain.

**Summary**

The 2021 Nissan Qashqai presents a range of potential issues. The most concerning relate to the CVT transmission, which can experience shuddering, hesitation, and in some cases, outright failure. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and misfires are also notable. Electrical issues related to battery drain and the infotainment system can be frustrating. Suspension issues may arise over time due to premature wear. Repair costs can vary significantly, with major transmission or engine work being the most expensive. While not all Qashqai owners will experience these problems, it's important to be aware of the potential issues when considering purchasing or maintaining this vehicle.
