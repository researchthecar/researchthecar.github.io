The 2018 Nissan NV350 Urvan is a popular choice for commercial and passenger transport, known for its spacious interior and reliability. Engine options typically include a 2.5L QR25DE inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 145-147 horsepower and 157 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L YD25DDTi diesel engine, generating approximately 127-129 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options usually consist of a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Urvan's practicality and cargo capacity but sometimes express concerns about fuel economy and ride comfort.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE (Gasoline)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs. This can manifest as a burning oil smell, blue exhaust smoke, or low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and consider using a higher viscosity oil. If the problem persists, a mechanic should inspect for leaks or worn piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$2,000+ depending on the cause (leaks vs. internal engine wear).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, a rattling noise from underneath the vehicle, and the check engine light illuminating with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L YD25DDTi (Diesel)**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, black smoke from the exhaust, and difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) and replace them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per injector and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF clogging can lead to reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, and the DPF warning light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration by a mechanic, or replacement of the DPF if regeneration is unsuccessful.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 for regeneration, $800 - $2000+ for replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting between gears, especially noticeable when accelerating or decelerating.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, perform a fluid change. If the problem persists, a mechanic should inspect the valve body or solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid change, $500 - $1500+ for valve body or solenoid repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revs increase disproportionately to vehicle speed, especially when accelerating in higher gears. This indicates the clutch is not fully engaging.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and potentially the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing after bumps, poor handling, and increased braking distance.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shock absorbers or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Worn bushings allow excessive movement in suspension components.
    * Solution: Replace the worn bushings, typically in the control arms or sway bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the specific bushing and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery frequently discharges, especially overnight or after the vehicle has been sitting for a period.
    *   Solution: A mechanic should perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Possible causes include faulty accessories, relays, or wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Doors failing to lock or unlock properly with the remote or door switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door(s), jamming, or excessive noise during operation.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rollers, tracks, and latch mechanism for damage or debris. Lubricate the moving parts. If necessary, replace worn rollers or repair the latch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the severity of the issue and parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blows warm air or cycles intermittently.
    *   Solution: Check the refrigerant level and recharge the system if necessary. If the problem persists, a mechanic should inspect the compressor, condenser, and other components for leaks or damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for recharge, $300 - $1200+ for component replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing in the dashboard, typically due to prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or use of a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1,000 for dashboard replacement
    * Recalls: None Found
