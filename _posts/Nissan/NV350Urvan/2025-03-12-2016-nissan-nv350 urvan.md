The 2016 Nissan NV350 Urvan is a popular choice for commercial use and passenger transport, known for its spacious interior and utilitarian design. Available engine options include the QR25DE 2.5L Inline-4 gasoline engine (around 145 hp and 159 lb-ft of torque) and the YD25DDTi 2.5L Inline-4 diesel engine (power varies depending on the market). Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate its cargo capacity and reliability for basic transportation, but common complaints often revolve around ride comfort, fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine), and certain electrical issues.

**Engine**

**QR25DE 2.5L Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This may be related to piston ring issues or valve stem seal wear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis can involve leak-down testing and inspection of valve stem seals. Repair may involve replacing piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (engine rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency. Could be due to engine running rich.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter. Also check for other issues if the catalytic converter failed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**YD25DDTi 2.5L Diesel Engine**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, difficulty starting, reduced power, and black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Diagnose faulty injectors and replace as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling noise from the engine, and potential oil leaks.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for damage. Repair or replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ (depending on whether repair or replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delays when shifting between gears, or harsh, jerky shifts. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn valve body components, or internal clutch issues.
    *   Solution: Check and top off transmission fluid, flush transmission. If problem persists, repair or replace the valve body. If the problem persists after that, a full transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid top-up) - $3,500+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. This can affect handling and ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs. Consider heavy-duty springs if the vehicle is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ (depending on the type of leaf springs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the door locks.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery light illuminated, dimming headlights, difficulty starting, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Test the alternator and replace if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door, sticking, or excessive noise. This can be due to worn rollers or a misaligned track.
    *   Solution: Inspect and lubricate the sliding door rollers and track. Replace worn rollers or adjust the track alignment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the extent of the repairs)

**Summary**

The 2016 Nissan NV350 Urvan presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical glitches to more significant engine and transmission concerns. The severity and cost of these issues can vary greatly depending on the specific engine, driving conditions, and maintenance history. Engine-related problems such as excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failure can be costly to repair, as can transmission issues like delayed or harsh shifting. Electrical problems like door lock actuator and alternator failures can also add to the overall maintenance costs.
