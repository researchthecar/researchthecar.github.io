### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Nissan NV350 Urvan demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its petrol engine option. The diesel engine, while more powerful, has a higher propensity for issues like turbocharger and injector problems, which are common in many diesel applications and can be costly to repair. Transmission reliability is generally sound, though clutch wear on manual versions and potential fluid leaks on automatics are noted. Suspension components, especially the rear leaf springs, can experience wear and tear under heavy loads. Electrical and interior systems are typically robust. For owners prioritizing longevity, regular maintenance and prompt attention to any diesel-specific warning signs are recommended.
