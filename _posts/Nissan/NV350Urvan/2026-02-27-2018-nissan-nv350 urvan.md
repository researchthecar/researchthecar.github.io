### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Nissan NV350 Urvan demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its petrol engine option. The diesel engine, while offering better torque and fuel efficiency for commercial use, presents a few more potential issues, notably with the turbocharger and injectors, which are common concerns for many diesel powertrains. Transmission reliability is decent, though clutch wear on manuals and potential fluid leaks on automatics are points to monitor. Suspension components, especially the rear leaf springs, can be subject to wear and tear under heavy loads. Electrical issues like alternator failure are not uncommon as the vehicle ages. Overall, the NV350 Urvan is a practical and dependable workhorse, with most issues being repairable and not indicative of systemic design flaws.
