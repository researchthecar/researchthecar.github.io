The 2015 Nissan NV350 Urvan is a popular cargo van known for its practicality and spaciousness, often used for commercial purposes and passenger transport. Available engines include the QR25DE 2.5L inline-4 gasoline engine (around 145 hp and 159 lb-ft of torque) and the YD25DDTi 2.5L inline-4 diesel engine. It typically comes with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine and region. Owners often appreciate its reliability and cargo capacity, but common complaints include the ride comfort, interior quality, and some specific mechanical issues that can arise over time.

**Engine**

**QR25DE 2.5L Gasoline**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil light illuminating, or noticeable oil level drop on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and potential replacement of valve stem seals or piston rings if the consumption is excessive and other causes are ruled out.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the source of the oil consumption and the repair needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail prematurely, resulting in a check engine light (typically P0420 code) and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**YD25DDTi 2.5L Diesel**

*   **Injector Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Diesel injectors can become clogged or fail, leading to rough idling, poor acceleration, and increased fuel consumption. Black smoke from the exhaust is also a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of faulty injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turbocharger failure can occur, resulting in a loss of power, increased engine noise (whining sound), and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **Hard Shifting (Automatic Transmission)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between certain gears. This could be caused by wear in the transmission or issues with the valve body.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush, valve body repair/replacement, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the rear leaf springs can sag, leading to a reduced ride height and compromised load-carrying capacity. This is especially common in vans that are regularly used for heavy cargo.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn shocks and struts lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shocks and struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks may fail to function correctly, either locking or unlocking erratically, or not responding at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or system.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify the source of the drain and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding door can become difficult to open or close, or may develop a rattling noise. This could be due to worn rollers, a misaligned track, or a faulty latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Adjustment or replacement of the door rollers, track, or latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced cooling performance or complete failure of the air conditioning system. This can be due to a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a clogged condenser.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the A/C system, which may involve recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, condenser, or other components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2015 Nissan NV350 Urvan presents a mix of potential issues. Engine problems, especially with the diesel variant, and transmission issues can be costly to address. Suspension and electrical problems are also common. Owners should be vigilant about preventative maintenance, particularly regarding oil consumption and potential injector problems. While some repairs may be minor, others can be quite expensive, so a pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
