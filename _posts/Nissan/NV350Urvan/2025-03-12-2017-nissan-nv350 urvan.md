The 2017 Nissan NV350 Urvan is a versatile and practical commercial van popular for its spacious interior, durability, and reliability. Available configurations typically include a 2.5L QR25DE Inline-4 gasoline engine producing approximately 145 horsepower and 157 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.5L YD25DDTi Inline-4 diesel engine, varying in output but around 127-130 horsepower and 266-272 lb-ft of torque. The gasoline engine is typically paired with a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel option usually comes with a 5-speed manual. Owners often appreciate the Urvan for its cargo capacity and dependability for business use, while some common complaints revolve around the somewhat basic interior and limited modern tech features compared to newer vans.

**Summary**

The 2017 Nissan NV350 Urvan, while a dependable workhorse, can experience several common issues. Engine problems such as excessive oil consumption in the gasoline engine and injector failure in the diesel engine can be costly. Transmission issues can cause rough shifting, and suspension bushing wear can impact ride quality. Electrical faults like battery drain and door lock actuator failures, along with sliding door problems, are also common. Air conditioning issues are also a common complaint. While many of these issues are manageable with regular maintenance, some repairs can be moderately expensive, especially those involving the engine and transmission.
