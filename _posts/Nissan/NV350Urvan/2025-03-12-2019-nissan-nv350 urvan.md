**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE Gasoline**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every few thousand miles, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a possible burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: A possible solution is to monitor the oil level regularly and use a higher viscosity oil. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L YD25DDTi Diesel**
*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and black smoke from the exhaust. The engine may also be difficult to start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s). It is often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, and the check engine light illuminating.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

*   **Slipping Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips when shifting gears, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. The engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might temporarily alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection and potential replacement of worn clutch packs or valve body components will be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $2,500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
