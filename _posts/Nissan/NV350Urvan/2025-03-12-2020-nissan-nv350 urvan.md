The 2020 Nissan NV350 Urvan is a popular choice for commercial and passenger transport due to its spacious interior and reliability. Available engine options typically include a 2.5-liter QR25DE inline-4 gasoline engine (around 145-147 horsepower and 157-163 lb-ft of torque, depending on the region) and a 2.5-liter YD25DDTi diesel engine. Transmission options generally consist of a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Urvan's practicality and cargo capacity, but some common complaints include issues with ride comfort, basic interior features, and susceptibility to crosswinds.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can manifest as the need to add oil every 1,000-2,000 miles and may be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test should be performed to diagnose the cause. Piston ring failure or valve seal issues are potential culprits. Repair may involve replacing the piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, decreased power, and the check engine light illuminating are common symptoms. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) like P0300, P0301, P0302, P0303, or P0304 (indicating misfires on specific cylinders) may be present.
    *   Solution: Identify the faulty coil using a scan tool and replace it. Replacing all coils at once is recommended for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per coil, including labor. Replacing all four coils can cost $400 - $800.
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.5L YD25DDTi Diesel Engine**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, black smoke from the exhaust, reduced fuel economy, and a loss of power. The engine may also be harder to start.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) using a diagnostic tool and replace them. Calibrate the new injectors using the appropriate Nissan software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector, including labor and calibration.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the turbocharger, loss of power, black smoke, and potential oil leaks.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for damage to the impeller or shaft play. Replace the turbocharger if necessary. Also, check and replace any damaged oil feed or drain lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+ for turbocharger replacement, including labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifting between gears, particularly between 1st and 2nd or 2nd and 3rd.
    *   Solution: First, check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter replacement might resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal damage may be present, requiring professional diagnosis and repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for a fluid flush and filter replacement. $800 - $2,500+ for valve body repair or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed. This can happen during acceleration or while climbing hills.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. Slipping can be caused by low fluid or contaminated fluid. If the fluid is okay, internal damage is likely and may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises coming from the suspension when driving over bumps. Handling may feel loose or imprecise.
    *   Solution: Inspect the suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.) for cracks or excessive wear. Replace worn bushings as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 per bushing replacement, depending on the location and labor involved.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks that fail to operate properly, either not locking/unlocking or making unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350 per door, including parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery frequently drains, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for a few days. This can make it difficult or impossible to start the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Conduct a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain and the necessary repairs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**

    *   Solution: Inspect the sliding door rollers, track, and latch mechanism for damage or wear. Lubricate the rollers and track. Replace worn or damaged parts as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the parts that need to be replaced and the labor involved.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blows warm air or fails to cool the cabin effectively.
    *   Solution: Check the refrigerant level and look for leaks. If the refrigerant is low, recharge the system and repair any leaks. If the refrigerant level is okay, other potential issues include a faulty compressor, condenser, or expansion valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for refrigerant recharge and leak repair. $500 - $1500+ for compressor, condenser, or expansion valve replacement.
