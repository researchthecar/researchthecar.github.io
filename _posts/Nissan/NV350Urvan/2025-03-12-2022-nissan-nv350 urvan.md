The 2022 Nissan NV350 Urvan is a versatile commercial van popular for its spacious cargo area and reliability. It's generally praised for its utilitarian design, ease of maintenance, and robust build. Criticisms often center on its basic interior features, ride comfort, and fuel economy compared to some competitors. The NV350 Urvan typically comes with a gasoline or diesel engine option. While exact specifications can vary depending on the market, a common engine choice is a 2.5-liter gasoline engine, producing around 145-150 horsepower and roughly 150-160 lb-ft of torque. Another engine option is a 2.5-liter diesel engine, rated at around 127-130 horsepower and 236-258 lb-ft of torque. These engines are usually paired with a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, depending on the specific configuration and market.

**Engine**

**2.5L Gasoline Engine**
*   **Excessive Engine Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibrations at idle and low speeds. Can lead to premature wear on engine mounts and other components.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn or damaged engine mounts. Check for proper engine balance and harmonic balancer condition.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Diesel Engine**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, warning lights illuminated on the dashboard, and potential for the engine to enter limp mode. This is often exacerbated by frequent short trips.
    *   Solution: Perform a forced DPF regeneration. If the DPF is severely clogged, it may need to be professionally cleaned or replaced. Investigate the root cause of excessive soot production if the problem recurs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky gear changes, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush using the correct Nissan-approved fluid. If the problem persists, a valve body inspection and possible replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Reduced handling stability and potential uneven tire wear. Usually affects the front lower control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspect suspension bushings for cracks or excessive play. Replace worn bushings as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
