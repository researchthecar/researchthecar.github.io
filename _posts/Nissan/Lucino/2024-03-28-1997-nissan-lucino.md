* **2.0-liter V6**
    * **Oil leaks:** Oil leaks are a common issue on the 2.0-liter V6 engine. The most common source of leaks is the valve cover gasket.
    * **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail on the 2.0-liter V6 engine, which can lead to catastrophic engine damage.
    * **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail on the 2.0-liter V6 engine, which can cause a loss of power and fuel efficiency.

**Transmission**

* **Five-speed manual**
    * **Grinding gears:** Grinding gears is a common issue on the five-speed manual transmission. The most common cause of grinding gears is a worn clutch.
    * **Leaking transmission fluid:** The transmission can leak fluid from the seals.

* **Four-speed automatic**
    * **Shifting problems:** Shifting problems are a common issue on the four-speed automatic transmission. The most common cause of shifting problems is a worn solenoid.
    * **Leaking transmission fluid:** The transmission can leak fluid from the seals.
    * **Transmission failure:** Transmission failure is a rare but serious issue on the four-speed automatic transmission. Transmission failure can be caused by a variety of factors, including overheating, lack of maintenance, and abuse.

* **Continuously variable transmission (CVT)**
    * **Slipping:** The CVT can slip, which can cause a loss of power and acceleration.
    * **Leaking transmission fluid:** The transmission can leak fluid from the seals.
    * **Transmission failure:** Transmission failure is a rare but serious issue on the CVT. Transmission failure can be caused by a variety of factors, including overheating, lack of maintenance, and abuse.
