The 2000 Nissan Lucino, also known as the Nissan Sentra in some markets, is a compact car appreciated for its reliability and fuel efficiency. Engine options typically included a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine (GA16DE) producing around 95 horsepower and a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine (SR20DE) offering around 140 horsepower, depending on the market. Transmission options were usually a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally like the Lucino for its simple design, affordability, and ease of maintenance, while some dislike its basic interior and limited features compared to newer cars.
