### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Nissan March demonstrates good overall reliability, with most major systems showing no significant widespread issues. The primary area of concern, though not universally reported, is the CVT transmission, which can occasionally exhibit judder or hesitation. This typically requires attention such as fluid services or software updates, with more severe issues potentially leading to costly repairs. Other components across the engine, suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior are generally robust for this model year. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any unusual transmission behavior are recommended for optimal long-term ownership.
