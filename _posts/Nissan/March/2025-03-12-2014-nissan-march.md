The 2014 Nissan March, also known as the Micra in some markets, is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and ease of use in urban environments. The 2014 models were generally equipped with a 1.2-liter inline 3-cylinder petrol engine producing around 76 horsepower and 78 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the March for its affordability and nimble handling. Common complaints often revolve around the relatively weak engine performance, especially when fully loaded, and the somewhat basic interior features.

**Engine**

**1.2L Inline 3-Cylinder Petrol Engine**

*   **Excessive Engine Vibration/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive engine vibration, particularly at idle. This can manifest as a shaky steering wheel or vibrating seats. It can be caused by worn engine mounts or issues with the idle air control system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the engine mounts can often resolve the vibration issue. Inspecting and cleaning or replacing the idle air control valve may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the location and cost of parts.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, loss of power. Check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty coil pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience hesitation or jerky movements during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can be attributed to the CVT's inherent design and can sometimes be exacerbated by degraded transmission fluid or a failing valve body.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid flush can sometimes improve the smoothness of the transmission. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete CVT rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT Fluid Flush $150 - $300, Valve Body Replacement $800 - $1500+, CVT Rebuild $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loud whine from the transmission, especially during acceleration. This can indicate wear and tear on the CVT's internal components.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. If the noise persists, a CVT rebuild or replacement is likely necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, leading to clunking noises, especially over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings, typically the lower control arm bushings or stabilizer bar bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per bushing/side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Power Window Switches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, intermittent operation, or requiring multiple attempts to open or close.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty power window switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the location and cost of parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining quickly, especially when the vehicle is not in use. This can be caused by parasitic drain from a faulty component or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic drain and repair or replace the faulty component. Replace the battery if it is failing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis $75-$150, Battery Replacement $100 - $300+, Parasitic Drain Repair varies greatly depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning blows warm air, indicating a potential failure of the compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty AC compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan March, while generally reliable and economical, does have a few common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant problems tend to revolve around the CVT transmission, which can exhibit hesitation, jerking, and whining noises. Engine vibration and electrical issues such as faulty power window switches can also occur. Suspension bushing wear is another area to inspect. Repair costs can vary widely, with CVT repairs potentially being the most expensive. Overall, while not catastrophic, these issues can impact the driving experience and budget if left unaddressed.
