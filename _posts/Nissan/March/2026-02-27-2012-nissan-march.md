The primary area of concern identified is the CVT transmission, which can be prone to fluid leaks and overheating, potentially leading to costly repairs. Engine and other systems, including suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components, generally do not exhibit widespread or significant issues beyond normal wear and tear. For prospective buyers, opting for a manual transmission can offer greater long-term reliability. Regular maintenance, particularly for the CVT fluid, is crucial to mitigate potential problems.
