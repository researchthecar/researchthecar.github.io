The 2013 Nissan March, also known as the Nissan Micra in some markets, is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. For the 2013 model year, a common engine option is the 1.2-liter inline-3 cylinder gasoline engine which produces around 79 horsepower and 79 lb-ft of torque. Some enjoy its compact size, making it easy to maneuver in urban environments, and its relatively low running costs. Common complaints revolve around its somewhat basic interior, limited cargo space, and modest performance.

**Engine**

**1.2L Inline-3 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage if not monitored closely.
    *   Solution: Regularly check oil levels and top up as needed. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic should inspect the engine for leaks, worn piston rings, or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Depending on the cause, repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor leaks to several thousand dollars for major engine work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking or pinging sound from the engine, especially under acceleration or when climbing hills. This can be caused by using low-octane fuel, carbon buildup, or a faulty knock sensor.
    *   Solution: Use the recommended fuel octane rating. Consider a fuel system cleaner to remove carbon buildup. Have a mechanic check the knock sensor and ignition timing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission exhibits jerky acceleration, hesitation, or a feeling of "rubber banding" where the engine revs up but the car doesn't accelerate smoothly.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ for fluid flush/filter change, $2500 - $5000+ for rebuild/replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A whining or high-pitched noise coming from the transmission, particularly during acceleration. This can indicate wear or damage to the CVT's internal components.
    *   Solution: Inspect the CVT fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, a fluid change may help. If the noise persists, the CVT may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ for fluid flush, $2500 - $5000+ for rebuild/replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and increased stopping distance. Visual inspection may reveal leaking fluid from the shock absorbers or struts.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shock absorbers or struts. Consider replacing them in pairs (both front or both rear) for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per pair, depending on the brand and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. The car may also feel loose or unstable.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn suspension bushings. This may involve replacing individual bushings or entire suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on which bushings need replacement and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery repeatedly dies, even after being fully charged. Possible causes include a parasitic drain from a faulty electrical component or a failing alternator.
    *   Solution: Have a mechanic perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Replace the faulty component or the alternator if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ for diagnosis, $100 - $500+ for repair depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows that operate slowly, erratically, or not at all. The window may also fall down into the door.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exterior door handles that break easily or become loose.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per handle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the dashboard
    * Solution: Replace the dashboard, or apply a cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Nissan March can experience a range of issues, with some of the more concerning ones relating to the CVT transmission. While some problems like worn suspension components are typical for a car of this age, CVT issues can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins and excessive oil consumption can also be problematic. Overall, it's important to thoroughly inspect a used 2013 Nissan March and address any potential issues promptly to ensure its reliability and longevity. The severity of issues varies, with costs ranging from minor repairs to potentially expensive transmission work.
