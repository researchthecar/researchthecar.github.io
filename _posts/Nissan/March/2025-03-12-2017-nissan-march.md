The 2017 Nissan March is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability, making it a popular choice for city driving. Engine options typically include a 1.2-liter three-cylinder petrol engine, producing around 76 horsepower and 78 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are usually a 5-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate its affordability and ease of parking, but may find the engine underpowered for highway driving and the interior materials basic.

**Engine**

**1.2L Three-Cylinder Petrol Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This may manifest as a low oil level warning light or noticeable oil loss on the dipstick.
    * Solution: Regularly check oil levels and use the recommended oil type. In severe cases, replacing piston rings or other internal engine components may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coil Pack Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, loss of power, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnosed with a scan tool indicating a specific cylinder misfire.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**

* **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or jerking during acceleration, especially from a stop or at low speeds. May also exhibit a "rubber band" feel, where engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    * Solution: A CVT fluid change may temporarily improve the condition. However, in many cases, the CVT may require repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) / $2,000 - $4,000+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CVT Chain Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the transmission, slipping, or complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the CVT chain. Depending on the damage, other internal components may also need replacement, or the entire CVT unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Steering may feel loose or wander.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn bushings in the control arms, sway bar links, and struts/shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per corner
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery frequently dies, especially if the car is left unused for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw, which could be a faulty relay, module, or aftermarket accessory.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning blows warm air, even when set to the coldest setting. This could be due to a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    * Solution: Recharge the refrigerant, replace the faulty compressor, or replace the blend door actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Nissan March can be a reliable and economical choice for city driving, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The CVT transmission is a source of potential problems and can be expensive to repair or replace. Excessive oil consumption in the 1.2L engine is another concern, along with suspension bushing wear and electrical issues. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor annoyances to significant repairs, and the cost to fix these issues can vary widely. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
