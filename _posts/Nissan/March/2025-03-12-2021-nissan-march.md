The 2021 Nissan March is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and nimble handling, making it a popular choice for city driving. However, like any vehicle, it has some known issues that owners have reported. Available engines include a 1.0-liter three-cylinder (approximately 70 horsepower) and a 1.2-liter three-cylinder (approximately 79 horsepower and 81 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual and a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Common praises include its compact size for easy parking and good fuel economy. Criticisms often revolve around its basic interior, limited cargo space, and sometimes underpowered engine, especially when fully loaded or driving uphill.
