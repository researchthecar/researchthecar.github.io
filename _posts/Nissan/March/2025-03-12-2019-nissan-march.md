The 2019 Nissan March, also known as the Micra in some markets, is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and ease of driving in urban environments. It is equipped with a 1.2-liter inline-three cylinder HR12DE engine producing around 79 horsepower and 79 lb-ft of torque. This engine is typically paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise its nimble handling and compact size for parking, while criticisms frequently target its somewhat dated interior and modest performance capabilities. Other engine options for other markets may include a 1.0-liter and a 1.5-liter, and other transmission options could include a 5-speed manual.
