The 2016 Nissan March, also known as the Micra in some markets, is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. The most common engine option is the 1.2-liter three-cylinder petrol engine, producing around 76 horsepower and 78 lb-ft of torque. The 2016 March offers a five-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate its compact size for city driving and its fuel economy. Common complaints include a lack of power, especially when fully loaded, and a basic interior.

**Engine**

**1.2L Three-Cylinder Petrol**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust can also be a symptom.
    * Solution: The repair will vary depending on the cause of the problem. Could be a worn piston ring or valve stem seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the cause

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

* **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change can alleviate the issue. In other cases, the CVT valve body needs to be replaced. In more severe cases, the entire CVT unit may require replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 for fluid change, $800 - $1,500 for valve body replacement, $2,500 - $4,000+ for full CVT replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, leading to clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps. The vehicle may also exhibit poor handling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings. In some cases, the entire control arm may need to be replaced if the bushings cannot be pressed out/in.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500 per corner, depending on the parts replaced and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine may run rough, stall, or have reduced power. Check engine light may illuminate with a MAF sensor-related code (e.g., P0101).
    * Solution: Replacement of the MAF sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may fail to cool the cabin effectively, or stop working altogether. This can be due to a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a problem with the blower motor.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the A/C system to identify the cause of the failure. Repair or replacement of the faulty component, followed by recharging the system with refrigerant.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+, depending on the component that needs replacing.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2016 Nissan March is a generally reliable car for its class, but owners should be aware of some potential issues. The CVT transmission, if equipped, can be a point of concern with potential for hesitation and jerking, and eventual failure. Some owners report excessive oil consumption with the 1.2L engine. Suspension bushing wear is another fairly common issue. A/C failure is also reported. The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major component replacements like the CVT. Overall, while some repairs can be costly, careful maintenance and awareness of these potential problems can help mitigate risks and keep the March running smoothly.
