**Introduction to the 2013 Nissan March**

The 2013 Nissan March is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability in urban environments. It comes standard with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine paired with a five-speed manual transmission. Optional engine and transmission options include a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine with a four-speed automatic transmission or CVT (continuously variable transmission).

Critics praise the March's low operating costs, spacious interior for its size, and comfortable ride. However, they also note its lack of power, especially with the 1.2-liter engine, and its interior's lack of premium materials.
