**Introduction:**

The 2021 Nissan March is a subcompact hatchback offered with two engine and transmission options: a 1.2-liter gasoline engine paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a 1.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine paired exclusively with the CVT. The 1.2-liter engine produces 79 horsepower and 77 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.0-liter turbo engine delivers 99 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. The March is praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability in urban environments. However, it has received some criticism for its limited cabin space and lack of some modern features.
