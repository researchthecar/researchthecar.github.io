The 2018 Nissan March is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability, making it a popular choice for city driving. It typically comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine, producing around 79 horsepower and 79 lb-ft of torque. The March is available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners generally appreciate its affordability, ease of parking, and good gas mileage. However, some common dislikes include its lack of power, basic interior, and sometimes unrefined CVT performance.
