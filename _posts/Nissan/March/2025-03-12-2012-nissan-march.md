The 2012 Nissan March, also known as the Micra in some markets, is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. The most common engine option is the 1.2-liter three-cylinder petrol engine, producing around 79 horsepower and 80 lb-ft of torque. Other available engines included a 1.5-liter four-cylinder petrol engine. The transmission options generally consist of a 5-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate its compact size, making it easy to maneuver and park in urban environments. However, some criticisms include its basic interior, limited cargo space, and somewhat underpowered engine, particularly when loaded with passengers or cargo.

**Engine**

**1.2L Three-Cylinder Petrol Engine**

* **Excessive Engine Vibration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive vibration, particularly at idle or low speeds. This can be felt through the steering wheel and seats.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a mechanic to check engine mounts, spark plugs, and throttle body. Replacement of worn engine mounts may resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coil Pack Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, check engine light illumination, and reduced fuel economy are all symptoms of coil pack failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty coil pack(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

* **CVT Slipping or Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the CVT slipping, hesitating during acceleration, or exhibiting jerky movements. This is more commonly reported in vehicles with higher mileage.
    * Solution: CVT fluid change may temporarily improve performance. In severe cases, the CVT unit may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid change); $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, particularly when driving over bumps. Reduced handling precision.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn bushings, typically in the control arms or sway bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    * Description/Symptoms: Inability to lock or unlock doors remotely or manually. Intermittent operation of door locks.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery dies unexpectedly, especially after the car has been sitting for a short period. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw (e.g., aftermarket accessories, faulty relay). Repair or replacement of the offending component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust Formation (Specific Regions)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust bubbles or surface rust appearing on the body panels, particularly in areas prone to moisture and salt exposure. This is more prevalent in regions with harsh winters.
    * Solution: Rust removal, body filler, and repainting. Rustproofing treatments to prevent further corrosion.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on severity and extent)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Airbag Warning Light**
    * Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard. This could indicate a fault with the airbag system or the seatbelt pretensioners.

**Summary**

The 2012 Nissan March exhibits a range of potential issues, from minor electrical glitches to more serious concerns with the CVT transmission. Engine vibration and suspension wear are also relatively common complaints. While many of these issues are not catastrophic, they can contribute to increased maintenance costs and reduced driving enjoyment. The severity and cost of repairs vary significantly depending on the specific problem, mileage, and maintenance history of the vehicle. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, paying particular attention to the CVT transmission and suspension components.
