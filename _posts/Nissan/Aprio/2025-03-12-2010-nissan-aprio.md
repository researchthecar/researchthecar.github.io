The 2010 Nissan Aprio is a subcompact car primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets. It was essentially a rebadged Renault Logan. The 2010 Aprio was equipped with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine, producing around 105 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. It was generally liked for its affordability and fuel efficiency, while disliked for its basic features and somewhat unrefined driving experience. It came available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
