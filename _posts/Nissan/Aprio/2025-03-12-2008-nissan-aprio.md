The 2008 Nissan Aprio is a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico. It was known for its affordability and fuel efficiency, making it a popular choice for budget-conscious buyers. The Aprio came with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 100 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. Most models were equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission, though a 4-speed automatic was also available. Owners often appreciated the Aprio's simple design and practicality. However, some common complaints included the lack of advanced features, limited cargo space, and concerns about build quality and reliability.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms may include the need to add oil more frequently, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Addressing excessive oil consumption often involves replacing worn valve stem seals or piston rings. In severe cases, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: An unstable or rough idle, particularly at start-up or when the engine is warm. Can be accompanied by hesitation or stalling.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the idle air control valve (IACV) is a common fix. Also, check for vacuum leaks, faulty spark plugs, or a dirty throttle body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding noises or difficulty engaging specific gears, particularly first or reverse. This can worsen over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, or throw-out bearing is a common repair. Inspecting and adjusting the shifter linkage may also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping Transmission**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip between gears or fail to engage properly. The engine revs high without corresponding acceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush might temporarily improve symptoms. However, worn clutch packs or valve body issues typically require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during turns, and poor handling. Can also cause tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn shock absorbers or struts. Consider replacing the strut mounts at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, or other suspension bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per bushing, depending on location and accessibility
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning Power Windows**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may operate intermittently, get stuck, or fail to work altogether.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window motor, window regulator, or repairing wiring issues within the door.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination due to faulty sensors, such as the oxygen sensor, crankshaft position sensor, or mass airflow sensor. Rough engine running or reduced fuel economy may also occur.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific faulty sensor and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust appearing on the body panels, particularly around the wheel wells, door sills, and undercarriage.
