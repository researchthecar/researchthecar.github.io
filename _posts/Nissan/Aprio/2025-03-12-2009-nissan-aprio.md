The 2009 Nissan Aprio is a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico. It was offered with a single engine option, a 1.6-liter inline-4 producing around 103 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated its fuel efficiency and affordability, while common dislikes included its basic features, less-than-stellar performance, and limited safety features.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include needing to add oil regularly and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: The root cause can vary, ranging from worn valve stem seals to piston ring issues. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the problem. Repairs might involve replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or in severe cases, an engine rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a rough idle, particularly when the engine is cold, and in some cases, the engine may stall.
    * Solution: Potential causes include a dirty throttle body, faulty idle air control valve (if equipped), or vacuum leaks. Cleaning the throttle body and checking for vacuum leaks are good starting points. Replacing the idle air control valve or other affected components might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough or delayed shifting, especially between gears, and occasional slipping.
    * Solution: First, check the transmission fluid level and condition. If low or dirty, a fluid change might help. If the problem persists, it could indicate internal wear or damage to the valve body or solenoids. A transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $2000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Inspect the shocks/struts, ball joints, tie rod ends, and bushings. Replacing worn components is necessary to restore proper handling and ride quality.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Faulty Window Switch**
    * Description/Symptoms: A very common issue is the power windows failing. This can be one window at a time or all windows at the same time.
    * Solution: The first step is to replace the switch. If that does not work, there may be a larger wiring problem in the vehicle.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $30 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Dead Batteries**
    * Description/Symptoms: Batteries can quickly die after purchase
    * Solution: Replace with an upgraded battery that is not prone to early failure.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can occur in multiple locations, particularly in areas with high salt usage.
    * Solution: Can be addressed with bodywork. Rust-proofing the vehicle before exposure to the elements can prevent rust.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks and warping of the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or installation of a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Nissan Aprio, while appreciated for its affordability and fuel efficiency, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most prominent issues revolve around engine oil consumption, transmission problems (especially with the automatic), suspension wear, and some electrical glitches. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive (e.g., cleaning the throttle body), others can be quite costly (e.g., engine rebuild or transmission replacement). Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, check its maintenance history, and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems before making a purchase.
