The 2011 Nissan Versa is a subcompact car known for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency. It was available as a sedan and a hatchback. The most common engine option for the 2011 Versa is a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine, producing approximately 107 horsepower and 111 lb-ft of torque. This engine could be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
