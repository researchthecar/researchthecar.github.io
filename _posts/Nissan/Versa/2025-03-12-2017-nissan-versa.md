The 2017 Nissan Versa is a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It is powered by a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine producing 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual (available only on the base S trim) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Versa's spacious interior for its class and its exceptional fuel economy. However, common complaints include lackluster acceleration, a basic interior with hard plastics, and limited features on lower trims.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the 1.6L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke, and potentially engine knocking if the oil level gets critically low.
    *   Solution: The specific cause is variable, but can be related to wear of the piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source. Repair may involve replacing the piston rings, valve stem seals, or even the entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity and the chosen repair (e.g., seals vs. engine replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine knocking or pinging, particularly under acceleration or when climbing hills, is reported by some owners. This can be caused by low-quality fuel, carbon buildup, or issues with the engine's timing or knock sensor.
    *   Solution: Try using higher-octane fuel. A mechanic can check the knock sensor and timing. A carbon clean/induction service may also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+, depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation upon acceleration, jerking or shuddering at low speeds, and a general lack of responsiveness are common complaints related to the CVT transmission.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid flush and filter change may help in some cases. If the problem persists, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced. Some owners have had success with a CVT control valve body replacement, which may be the source of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change: $200-300. Valve Body Replacement: $800-1500. CVT rebuild/replacement: $2500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete failure of the CVT transmission is reported by some owners, often with little warning. Symptoms include loud noises, inability to accelerate, and complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT transmission is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the struts and shocks can lead to a bouncy or unstable ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle (front or rear) depending on the shop and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing unexplained battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various circuits and components to isolate the faulty part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Oxygen Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning oxygen sensors can trigger the check engine light and lead to poor fuel economy and performance issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings is a common issue, which can reduce visibility and potentially damage the headlight bulbs or wiring.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlight assembly, drying it out, and resealing it. In some cases, the headlight assembly may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ for resealing, $200 - $500+ for headlight assembly replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard material is a reported issue, particularly in vehicles exposed to high temperatures.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is the most thorough solution, but can be expensive. Some owners opt for dashboard covers or repair kits as a more affordable alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dashboard cover: $50-150. Dashboard replacement $500-1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Nissan Versa has several common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most concerning are related to the CVT transmission, which can exhibit hesitation and jerking, and in some cases, fail completely. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption and knocking, are also important to consider. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like CVT replacement, can be quite costly. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures.
