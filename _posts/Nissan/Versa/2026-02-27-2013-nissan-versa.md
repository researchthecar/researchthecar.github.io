### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Nissan Versa, while generally a dependable vehicle for its price point, exhibits some notable concerns, primarily with its powertrain. The 1.6L engine can experience oil consumption issues, and the widely used Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) has a history of premature failure, often requiring costly replacement. Manual transmissions appear to be more robust. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are generally reliable with no widespread critical issues reported. Prospective buyers should be particularly aware of the potential for CVT problems and factor in the possibility of engine oil consumption.
