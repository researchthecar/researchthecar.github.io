The 2007 Nissan Versa was a subcompact car offering practicality and affordability. It came with a 1.8-liter inline-4 engine (MR18DE) producing around 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic, and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciated its spacious interior and fuel efficiency, but disliked its basic features and somewhat unrefined driving experience.

**Engine**

**1.8L MR18DE**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported the 1.8L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-ups. This could manifest as low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and/or engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions ranged from using a higher viscosity oil to replacing piston rings or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, illuminated check engine light (often code P0420 - Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold), and potential rattling sounds from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky acceleration, slipping, hesitation, whining noises, and ultimately complete transmission failure. The CVT is prone to overheating and premature wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the CVT.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping, and hesitation, particularly when cold.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncing or unstable ride, especially over bumps, and clunking noises from the rear of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, reduced power, and illuminated check engine light (often codes P0300-P0304).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per coil (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: HVAC only works on some speeds, or doesn't work at all.
    * Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the rocker panels, wheel wells, and underbody, especially in areas with road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, body panel replacement (depending on severity).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard material, especially in sun-exposed areas.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement (expensive) or dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Nissan Versa, while affordable and practical, had some notable issues. The most serious problems were related to the CVT transmission, which was prone to failure and expensive to repair. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and catalytic converter failure were also common. Electrical and suspension problems were less severe but still required attention. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering a used 2007 Nissan Versa. Due to the possibility of catastrophic CVT failure, this is a vehicle that is potentially more expensive to maintain than other subcompact cars from this era.
