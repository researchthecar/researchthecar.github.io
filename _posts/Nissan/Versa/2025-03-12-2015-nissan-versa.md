The 2015 Nissan Versa is a subcompact car known for its affordability and spacious interior, especially in the rear seats. It was available as a sedan and a hatchback (Versa Note). The 2015 Versa comes standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque.
