The 2021 Nissan Versa is a subcompact sedan offering a comfortable ride and good fuel economy at an affordable price. It comes standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 122 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission (available only on the base S trim) or an Xtronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) on all trims. Owners generally appreciate the Versa's spacious interior and user-friendly technology, but some common complaints include underwhelming acceleration and excessive road noise.

**Summary**

Most problems are mild and have a low cost to repair. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
