The 2024 Nissan Versa is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and surprisingly spacious interior for its class. It comes standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 122 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. The base model S comes with a 5-speed manual transmission, while the SV and SR trims come standard with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). What people like about the Versa is its value proposition, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. Common dislikes include its somewhat underpowered engine, basic interior materials, and the CVT's sometimes sluggish response.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Engine Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported louder-than-expected engine noise, particularly during acceleration. This may be caused by the engine working hard, due to a lack of available power.
    *   Solution: Inspect the engine for any leaks or damage, check oil levels, and have the car inspected by a mechanic. If the noise is determined to be normal engine sounds from the small displacement engine, no repair may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0-$100+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT**

*   **Delayed Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted a slight delay in acceleration or hesitation when pressing the accelerator pedal. This is a common trait of CVTs.
    *   Solution: If the issue persists, the CVT fluid level should be checked and topped off. If that is not the issue, then the CVT could have an internal failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0-$5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen occasionally freezes or responds slowly to touch inputs.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. If the problem persists, the software may need to be updated or the head unit replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0-$800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
