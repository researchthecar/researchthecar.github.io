The 2010 Nissan Versa is a subcompact car known for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency. It came with two engine options: a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 107 horsepower and 111 lb-ft of torque and a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Versa's affordability and fuel economy but often complain about its underwhelming performance and basic features.

**Engine**

**1.8L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs. This can be noticed by low oil levels on the dipstick, blueish smoke from the exhaust, or the low oil pressure light illuminating.
    *   Solution: The fix can range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, or in severe cases, replacing the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 1.8L engines have experienced timing chain issues, which can manifest as a rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup. Over time, this can lead to reduced engine performance or even engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Four-Cylinder Engine**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is prone to failure, often exhibiting symptoms such as shuddering, slipping, hesitation upon acceleration, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: In many cases, the only solution is to replace the entire CVT unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Fluid Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: CVT fluid leaks can occur from the transmission seals or the CVT cooler lines. Low fluid levels can cause transmission slipping and overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking seals or lines, and refilling the CVT fluid with the correct Nissan NS-2 CVT fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

No Issues Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and failure of the front strut mounts can cause clunking or popping noises when turning or driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts. It's often recommended to replace the struts and shocks at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failure (Crankshaft or Camshaft Position Sensor)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the crankshaft or camshaft position sensor can cause stalling, rough running, or a no-start condition. The check engine light will usually illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Nissan Versa can have a variety of issues, the most serious being related to the CVT transmission. CVT failure can be quite expensive to repair. Engine issues such as oil consumption and timing chain problems can also lead to substantial repair costs. Suspension and electrical issues are generally less severe but can still be an inconvenience. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, especially the CVT transmission, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
