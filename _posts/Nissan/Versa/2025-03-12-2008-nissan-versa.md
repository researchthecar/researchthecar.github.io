The 2008 Nissan Versa is a subcompact car known for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency. It was available as a hatchback and a sedan. The standard engine was a 1.6-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 107 horsepower and 111 lb-ft of torque. Some models had the optional 1.8-liter inline-4 cylinder engine that produced 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. The 1.6L engine could be paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, while the 1.8L engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, or CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often liked the Versa for its affordability and roominess, but common complaints included the car's somewhat bland styling, basic features, and potential reliability issues.
