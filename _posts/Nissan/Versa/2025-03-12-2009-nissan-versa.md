The 2009 Nissan Versa is a subcompact car known for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency. Engine options include a 1.6-liter inline-4 producing 107 horsepower and 111 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8-liter inline-4 generating 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. The 1.6-liter engine was only available with a 5-speed manual. The 1.8-liter engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic, or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Versa's affordability and practicality but sometimes complain about its basic features and somewhat unrefined driving experience.
