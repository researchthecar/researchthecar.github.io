The 2012 Nissan Versa is a subcompact car known for its affordability and spacious interior, particularly in the rear seats. It was available as a sedan and a hatchback (Versa Note). The engine option was a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners generally appreciate the Versa's fuel efficiency and low price point, but often complain about its sluggish acceleration, basic features, and less-than-stellar build quality.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles, blue smoke from the exhaust (especially on startup), and a possible burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing valve stem seals or piston rings can address the issue. If severe, an engine replacement might be necessary.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of struts and shocks can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 (for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**Summary:**

The 2012 Nissan Versa is plagued by several common issues, with the CVT transmission being the most significant and expensive to address. Engine-related problems like excessive oil consumption and catalytic converter failure are also prevalent. Suspension issues and electrical faults can add to the ownership costs. While the Versa is an affordable vehicle, potential buyers should be aware of these potential repair expenses. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate (worn struts/shocks) to severe (CVT failure), and the costs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
