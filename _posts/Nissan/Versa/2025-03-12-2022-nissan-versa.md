The 2022 Nissan Versa is a subcompact sedan known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and surprisingly spacious interior. It is available with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 122 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. The base S trim comes standard with a 5-speed manual transmission, but most models are equipped with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While owners appreciate the Versa's value, fuel economy, and comfortable ride, common complaints include its lackluster acceleration, basic interior materials, and limited features on lower trims.
