## Engine

### 1.6L HR16DE (I4)
**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage if not monitored.
- **Solution:** Regular oil level checks and top-offs. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $4,000 (for rebuild/replacement)

**Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup; check engine light may illuminate.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the VVT actuator and potentially the camshaft phaser.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Transmission

### 4-Speed Automatic
**Harsh Shifting / Slipping**
- **Symptoms:** Jerky gear changes, delayed engagement, or the transmission slipping out of gear.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2,500


### 5-Speed Manual
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Clutch replacement (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $600 - $1,200


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Strut Mounts**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking or popping noises when turning or going over bumps.
- **Solution:** Replacement of front strut mounts.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Various electrical components (lights, power windows, locks) may malfunction intermittently or cease to work.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1,000


### Alternator
**Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Dimming headlights, battery warning light, difficulty starting the engine.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Exterior

### Body Panels
**No Major Issues**
- **Symptoms:** No widespread issues reported.
- **Solution:** N/A
- **Cost:** N/A


## Interior

### Dashboard Materials
**Cracking/Fading**
- **Symptoms:** Dashboard surface can crack or fade due to sun exposure over time.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the dashboard assembly.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1,500


### HVAC Blower Motor
**Failure**
- **Symptoms:** No air coming from the vents, or intermittent airflow.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blower motor and resistor.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400

### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Nissan Versa is a budget-friendly option that offers reasonable reliability, especially for its price point. The most common concerns revolve around the 1.6L engine's potential for oil consumption and VVT issues, as well as the automatic transmission's tendency for harsh shifting. Electrical components like the alternator and BCM can also be points of failure. While the exterior is generally solid, interior elements like the dashboard can degrade. For potential buyers, a thorough pre-purchase inspection focusing on these areas is recommended. Regular maintenance, particularly oil level checks, is crucial for longevity.
