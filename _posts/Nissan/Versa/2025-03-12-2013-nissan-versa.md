The 2013 Nissan Versa is a subcompact car known for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency. It was available with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Versa's affordability and fuel economy, but common complaints include its lack of power, basic interior, and CVT transmission issues.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, and potential check engine light illumination (often with codes related to misfires). Could be caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s) and/or spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil/spark plug replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission can exhibit shuddering, hesitation, or complete failure. This is often due to internal wear and tear or overheating of the transmission fluid. Some owners report the transmission failing prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT transmission. In some cases, a fluid change *might* temporarily alleviate the issue, but it's often a short-term fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Hesitation/Lack of Power**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, a lack of power, or a feeling that the transmission is "slipping." This can be more pronounced when climbing hills or carrying a load.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid flush and refill can help, but often the damage is already done. Transmission replacement is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for fluid flush (may not fix the problem). $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and unusual noises (clunking or squeaking) from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per strut/shock (depending on location and brand)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery light illuminated on the dashboard, dimming headlights, difficulty starting the engine, or complete electrical failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, either intermittently or completely. This can be due to a faulty window motor, switch, or wiring.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor, switch, or repair the damaged wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage/Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the undercarriage, especially in areas exposed to road salt. Rust can also appear on body panels, particularly around wheel wells and door seams.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. Apply rust inhibitor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on severity).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light On**
    * Description/Symptoms: Airbag light illuminates on the dash. Could be related to a faulty sensor.
    * Solution: Diagnose the airbag system and replace the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Nissan Versa, while economical and spacious, is prone to a few recurring issues. The most significant concern is the potential for CVT transmission problems, which can be very expensive to repair or replace. Electrical issues and suspension wear are also common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and the cost of repairs can vary widely.
