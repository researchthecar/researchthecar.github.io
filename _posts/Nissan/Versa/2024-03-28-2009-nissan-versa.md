**Introduction:**

The 2009 Nissan Versa is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It offers two engine options: a 1.6L inline-4 and a 1.8L inline-4. The 1.6L engine produces 107 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.8L engine delivers 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual for both engine choices. Owners appreciate the Versa's easy handling, comfortable cabin, and low cost of ownership. However, it has drawn criticism for its lackluster performance and poor sound insulation.
