The 2020 Nissan Versa is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior for its class, and affordable price point. It comes equipped with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 122 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. It is available with either a 5-speed manual transmission (base model only) or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT).
