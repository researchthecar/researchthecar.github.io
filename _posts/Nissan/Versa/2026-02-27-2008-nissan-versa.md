### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Nissan Versa is a budget-friendly option with a generally acceptable reliability record for its class and age. Key areas to inspect include potential oil consumption in the 1.8L engine, transmission issues (especially with the CVT), and common wear items like suspension bushings and strut mounts.
