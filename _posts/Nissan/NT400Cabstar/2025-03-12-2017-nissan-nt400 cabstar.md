The 2017 Nissan NT400 Cabstar is a light commercial vehicle known for its maneuverability and utility in urban environments. Engine options vary depending on the market, but commonly include a 2.5-liter diesel engine producing around 130 horsepower and approximately 221 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter diesel engine producing around 150 horsepower and approximately 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically consist of a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automated manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Cabstar's compact size and ability to navigate tight spaces, along with its payload capacity. Some common dislikes include the basic interior and ride quality.

**Engine**

**2.5-Liter Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and potentially a check engine light. The fuel injectors may become clogged or fail electronically.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injectors and ensure proper fuel system maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbo, loss of power, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential turbo failure. Can be caused by oil starvation or foreign object damage.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the turbocharger failure. Repair or replace the turbocharger unit and address any underlying issues such as oil leaks or blockages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0-Liter Diesel**

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor performance, increased emissions, and potential stalling. The EGR valve can become clogged with carbon deposits.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup. Potential for catastrophic engine damage if the chain breaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, sprockets, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting/Grinding Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard to shift into certain gears, grinding noises when shifting, or the transmission popping out of gear.
    *   Solution: Inspect and possibly replace the clutch assembly (clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing). Check and potentially replace worn synchros within the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1500+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automated Manual Transmission**

*   **Jerky Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation when shifting gears.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission adaptation reset and potentially replace the transmission control module (TCM) if it is faulty. Check the clutch actuator as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sitting lower than normal, reduced ride height, and potential cracking of the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or damaged leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll, and potential damage to other suspension components.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight, difficulty starting the vehicle, and the need for frequent jump-starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair any parasitic draws on the electrical system, such as a faulty relay or a malfunctioning module. Replace the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (ABS, Wheel Speed, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS warning lights, traction control issues, and potential impact on braking performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Chassis/Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust on the chassis or frame, potentially weakening the structure of the vehicle over time. Particularly prevalent in areas with high salt usage on roads.
    *   Solution: Remove rust, apply a rust inhibitor, and potentially weld in new sections of metal if the rust is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows not operating smoothly, making grinding noises, or failing to operate at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Nissan NT400 Cabstar has some common issues across its engine and transmission options, as well as suspension and electrical systems. Engine issues like fuel injector failure, turbocharger problems, EGR valve problems, and timing chain wear are all of moderate to high severity and cost a moderate amount to repair. Transmission issues like difficulty shifting, grinding, jerky shifting, and hesitation are moderate in severity and cost a moderate amount to repair. Suspension issues such as leaf spring sagging and worn shock absorbers are generally moderate severity and cost a moderate amount to repair. Electrical issues like battery drain and sensor failures are also of moderate severity and cost a moderate amount to repair. Exterior issues like rust can vary widely in severity and cost a wide range to repair. Finally, interior issues like window regulator failure are of moderate severity and cost a moderate amount to repair. While most of these issues are relatively minor and have minimal cost, when added together they can make the ownership of the vehicle costly.
