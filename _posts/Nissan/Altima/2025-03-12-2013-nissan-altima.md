The 2013 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5-liter V6 engine outputting 270 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate its spacious interior and smooth handling, while common dislikes include CVT reliability issues and some perceived cheapness in interior materials.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Cylinder**

**Summary**

The 2013 Nissan Altima presents a mixed bag for potential buyers. The most significant concern revolves around the CVT transmission, with issues ranging from juddering to complete failure, potentially leading to costly repairs. Excessive oil consumption on the 2.5L engine is another noteworthy issue. Other problems such as premature suspension component failure, electrical glitches, dashboard cracking, and rust can contribute to the overall ownership experience. While some issues are relatively minor, the potential for major CVT problems makes careful inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic essential before buying a used 2013 Altima. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for a transmission replacement, so factor this into your purchasing decision.
