# 2002 Nissan Altima

### Overview
The 2002 Nissan Altima, part of the third generation (L31), offered a blend of sporty styling and practicality. It was available with a choice of two engines: a 2.5-liter inline-four and a 3.5-liter V6, both paired with either a 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While generally considered a reliable vehicle for its era, certain components have shown a propensity for issues. Owners often report on the durability of the powertrain, but some electrical and suspension components can require attention as the vehicle ages. Regular maintenance is key to ensuring the longevity of this model.

### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Nissan Altima is a generally dependable vehicle, particularly with the 3.5L V6 engine and manual transmission. However, the 2.5L engine is known for potential oil consumption and head gasket issues, which can be costly to repair. The CVT transmission also presents a higher risk of failure compared to the traditional automatic or manual options. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM, and suspension wear are also points to consider. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in potential maintenance costs, especially for higher-mileage examples.
