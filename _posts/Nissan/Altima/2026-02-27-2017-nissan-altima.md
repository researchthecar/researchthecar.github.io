### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Nissan Altima presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.5L engine has seen reports of oil consumption, and the CVT transmission is a notable area of concern, with potential for overheating and failure. Owners should be diligent with maintenance and monitoring of fluid levels for the 2.5L models. The 3.5L V6 engine appears more robust. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and keyless entry, are present but generally manageable. Exterior and interior components are largely reliable, with isolated reports of headlight condensation and climate control blower motor issues. Overall, while the Altima offers good value, potential buyers should be aware of the CVT's reputation and consider the maintenance history.
