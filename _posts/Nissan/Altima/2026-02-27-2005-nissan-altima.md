# 2005 Nissan Altima

### Overview
The 2005 Nissan Altima, part of the third generation (2002-2006), offered a blend of sporty styling and practicality. It was available with a choice of two engines: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a 3.5-liter V6, both paired with either a 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While generally considered a reliable vehicle for its era, certain components have shown a propensity for issues that owners should be aware of. This analysis focuses on common mechanical and electrical concerns reported by owners and technicians, excluding routine maintenance and expected wear and tear.

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Nissan Altima presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.5L V6 engine is generally robust, but the 2.5L four-cylinder is prone to oil consumption and head gasket issues, requiring vigilant maintenance. The CVT transmission is a notable weak point, with reports of hesitation and slipping, often necessitating costly repairs. Other common concerns include front suspension noises, electrical gremlins related to the BCM, premature alternator failure, and exterior paint degradation. While the interior is generally solid, the HVAC blower motor can fail. Owners should prioritize regular checks of oil levels for the 2.5L engine and be prepared for potential transmission issues, especially with the CVT.
