The 2016 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior. It offers two engine options: a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine producing 182 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 270 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Altima's smooth ride and good gas mileage. Common complaints include issues with the CVT transmission and some electrical problems.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, engine knocking, and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: The specific repair varies depending on the cause and severity of the oil consumption. It may involve replacing piston rings or other internal engine components. A complete engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+

**3.5L V6**
*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint is CVT failure or malfunction. Symptoms include shuddering, jerking during acceleration, hesitation, slipping, or complete loss of power. Warning lights such as the "Check Engine" light or transmission-specific warning lights may illuminate.
    *   Solution: In many cases, the CVT needs to be replaced. A software update may resolve some minor issues, but more significant problems usually necessitate a replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls:
        *   16V912000: This recall addresses a software issue in the Transmission Control Module (TCM) that may cause the CVT to enter a fail-safe mode, resulting in reduced speed or stalling.

**Suspension**

*No Issues Found*

**Electrical**
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the car battery draining prematurely, even when the vehicle is turned off. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic drain is crucial. This may involve testing individual electrical components to identify the culprit. Repairing or replacing the faulty component will resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Navigation system freezes, glitches, or becomes unresponsive. Bluetooth connectivity problems.
