### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Nissan Altima generally presents a good reliability record, particularly with the V6 engine option. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the 2.5L engine's tendency for oil consumption and potential leaks from the CVT cooler lines, which can lead to transmission problems if not addressed promptly. The Xtronic CVT itself, while efficient, has also been a source of concern for some owners, with reports of overheating or failure, often exacerbated by fluid issues. However, for owners who diligently monitor oil levels and address any fluid leaks, the Altima can be a dependable vehicle. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread, recurring technical defects.
