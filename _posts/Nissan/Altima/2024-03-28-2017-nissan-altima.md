**2017 Nissan Altima**

The 2017 Nissan Altima is a midsize sedan offered with a choice of two engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 179 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 with 270 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Both engines come mated to a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and the V6 can also be paired with a six-speed manual transmission.
