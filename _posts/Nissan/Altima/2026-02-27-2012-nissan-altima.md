# 2012 Nissan Altima

### Overview
The 2012 Nissan Altima is generally considered a reliable vehicle, offering a good balance of performance and fuel efficiency for its class. It was available with two primary engine options: a fuel-efficient 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a more powerful 3.5-liter V6. Both were typically paired with Nissan's Xtronic Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While most owners report a positive ownership experience, like any vehicle, there are specific areas that have seen more attention from repair shops. This analysis focuses on documented common issues beyond routine maintenance, providing insights into potential reliability concerns for prospective buyers or current owners.

### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Nissan Altima presents a generally reliable profile, particularly with the V6 engine. The most common concerns revolve around the 2.5L engine's potential for oil consumption and VVT issues, and the Xtronic CVT's susceptibility to overheating and failure, especially with higher mileage. Electrical gremlins like key fob malfunctions and infotainment glitches are also noted but are typically less severe. Owners should be diligent with maintenance, especially fluid changes for the CVT and monitoring oil levels for the 2.5L engine, to mitigate these potential reliability concerns and ensure a longer lifespan for the vehicle.
