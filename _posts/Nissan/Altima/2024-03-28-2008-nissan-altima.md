## 2008 Nissan Altima

The 2008 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan that was offered with three engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, a 3.5-liter V6, and a hybrid version of the 2.5-liter four-cylinder. Transmission options included a six-speed manual for the 2.5-liter four-cylinder, a four-speed automatic for the 3.5-liter V6, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) for the hybrid model.

The Altima was praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and affordable price. However, it also received criticism for its lackluster performance, poor fuel economy, and dated interior design.

### Engine
**2.5-liter Four-Cylinder**

* **Oil Consumption:** Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, particularly on engines built before 2010. Symptoms include a low oil level warning light and a noticeable decrease in oil level between oil changes. The solution is to replace the piston rings, which can cost between **$1,500 - $2,000+**.
* **Timing Chain Noise:** The timing chain on some engines, particularly those manufactured between 2007 and 2010, may stretch over time, causing a rattling or ticking noise. Replacing the timing chain and related components can cost around **$1,000 - $2,000+**.

**3.5-liter V6**

* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure:** The camshaft position sensor on some V6 engines may fail, causing the engine to stall or hesitate. Replacing the sensor costs around **$200 - $400+**.

### Transmission
**Six-Speed Manual**

* **No Issues Found**

**Four-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slipping:** Some owners have reported that the transmission may slip or hesitate when shifting gears. This can be caused by worn or damaged clutches, which may need to be replaced. The cost of a transmission rebuild can range from **$2,000 - $4,000+**.

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

* **CVT Failure:** The CVT on some hybrid models may fail, causing the vehicle to lose power or experience rough shifting. Replacing the CVT can cost between **$5,000 - $7,000+**.

### Suspension

* **Strut Mount Failure:** The strut mounts on some Altimas may wear out prematurely, causing a clunking or rattling noise when driving over bumps. Replacing the strut mounts costs around **$200 - $400+** per side.

### Electrical

* **Battery Drain:** Some Altimas may experience battery drain due to a faulty ignition switch or alternator. Replacing the battery or alternator typically costs around **$200 - $500+**.
* **Radio Malfunction:** The radio on some Altimas may experience problems such as intermittent audio loss or screen glitches. Replacing the radio can cost between **$500 - $1,000+**.

### Exterior

* **No Issues Found**

### Interior

* **Heater Core Failure:** The heater core on some Altimas may fail, causing a lack of heat in the cabin during winter. Replacing the heater core can cost around **$500 - $1,000+**.
* **Climate Control Display Malfunction:** The climate control display on some Altimas may experience problems such as intermittent display loss or incorrect temperature readings. Replacing the display costs around **$200 - $400+**.

### Summary

The 2008 Nissan Altima is a reliable vehicle with few major issues. However, some owners have reported problems with oil consumption, timing chain noise, transmission slipping, and suspension issues. The severity of these issues varies, and the cost of repairs can be substantial. Overall, the Altima is a good choice for budget-minded buyers who prioritize comfort and space over performance and fuel economy.
