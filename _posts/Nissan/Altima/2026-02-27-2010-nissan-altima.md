# 2010 Nissan Altima

### Overview
The 2010 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its sporty driving dynamics and comfortable interior. It was offered with a choice of two main powertrains: a fuel-efficient 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and a more powerful 3.5-liter V6. Both engines were generally reliable, though some owners reported specific issues. The Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) was standard on most models and while generally smooth, it has been a point of concern for some owners regarding longevity. Other areas like suspension, electrical systems, and interior components have seen a mixed bag of reports, with some common issues surfacing over time. Overall, the 2010 Altima presents a decent value, but potential buyers should be aware of common problem areas.

### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Nissan Altima offers a generally solid ownership experience, particularly with the 3.5L V6 engine. However, the 2.5L engine has known issues with oil consumption and timing chain wear that require diligent maintenance. The CVT transmission is the most significant concern, with a history of premature failure and costly repairs. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, and electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior paint issues and interior wear on the driver's seat are also reported. Regular maintenance, especially for the engine and transmission fluid, is crucial for maximizing the lifespan of this vehicle.
