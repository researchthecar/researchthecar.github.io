The 2006 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 175 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 generating 270 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices consist of a 5-speed manual (available on some 2.5L models), a 4-speed automatic (2.5L), and a 5-speed automatic (3.5L). Owners generally appreciate the Altima's fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.5L engine), responsive steering, and available V6 power. Common dislikes include interior plastic quality, potential for rust, and certain reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can mitigate the issue, but in severe cases, engine replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature catalytic converter failure can occur, resulting in a check engine light and reduced engine performance. This is often attributed to oil consumption issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to rattling noises, especially on startup. If left unaddressed, it can cause significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including valve cover gaskets and the oil pan gasket.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per leak location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (2.5L)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported hard or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the transmission valve body, solenoids, or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (3.5L)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4-speed, the 5-speed automatic can experience hard or erratic shifting, slipping, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the transmission valve body, solenoids, or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front strut mounts can wear out and fail, resulting in clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts. Replacing the struts at the same time is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn or damaged rear trailing arm bushings can cause rear end instability, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear trailing arm bushings or the entire trailing arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Check Engine Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light can illuminate for various reasons, often related to emissions control components or sensor failures.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the code and replace the faulty sensor or component. Common culprits include oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and evap system components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate due to a faulty window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2006 Altima is prone to rust, particularly in areas with harsh winters and road salt. Common rust spots include the wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair and prevention measures, such as rust converters and paint touch-ups. In severe cases, body panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the severity and location of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system can experience problems, such as refrigerant leaks, compressor failure, or blower motor issues, leading to weak or no cold air.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Nissan Altima, while praised for its performance and handling, does have some common issues to watch out for. Engine problems like excessive oil consumption (2.5L) and timing chain tensioner failure (3.5L) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly shifting problems, are also a concern. Suspension components like strut mounts and trailing arm bushings tend to wear out. Rust can be a significant problem, especially in colder climates. Interior issues like AC problems and dashboard cracking are also prevalent. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major repairs, with potential costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
