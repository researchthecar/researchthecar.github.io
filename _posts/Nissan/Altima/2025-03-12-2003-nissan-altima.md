The 2003 Nissan Altima was a popular mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling and relatively spacious interior. It came with a few engine options including a 2.5L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 175 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 engine producing around 240 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions were either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic (with the 2.5L) or a 5-speed automatic (with the 3.5L). Many owners appreciated the Altima's styling and driving dynamics, while some common complaints revolved around premature component wear and certain reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2003 Nissan Altima, while generally a decent car, has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly with the 2.5L engine (catalytic converter, oil consumption), can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, suspension wear, and electrical problems are also common. Rust can be a significant concern in certain climates. The severity and cost of repairs can vary depending on the vehicle's condition and maintenance history. Due to the age of the vehicle, finding well-maintained examples and performing a thorough inspection before purchasing are essential.
