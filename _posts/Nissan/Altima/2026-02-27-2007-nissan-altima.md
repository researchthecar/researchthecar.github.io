# 2007 Nissan Altima

### Overview
The 2007 Nissan Altima, part of the fourth generation, offered a blend of sporty styling and practicality. It was available with a choice of two engines: a fuel-efficient 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a more powerful 3.5-liter V6. Both were paired with either a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or a manual gearbox. While generally considered a reliable vehicle for its class, certain components and systems have been noted for specific issues that can arise with age and mileage. Understanding these potential problems can help owners with maintenance and repair planning.

### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Nissan Altima is a generally dependable vehicle, but like many cars of its age, it is susceptible to certain issues. The most commonly reported problems revolve around the CVT transmission, particularly overheating and valve body issues, which can be costly to repair. Engine-specific concerns include oil consumption in the 2.5L and VVT actuator problems in the 3.5L V6. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions, and common wear items like suspension components and alternators are also points to consider. Regular maintenance, especially for the transmission fluid, and prompt attention to warning signs can significantly extend the life and reliability of the 2007 Altima.
