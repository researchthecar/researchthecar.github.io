The 2002 Nissan Altima marked a significant redesign for the model, moving to a larger, more powerful platform. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 engine producing 240 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission (the 3.5L V6 was later offered with a 5-speed automatic). Owners often praised the Altima for its sporty handling, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the engine and transmission, as well as some electrical problems.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 (QR25DE)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, often exceeding 1 quart per 1,000 miles. This can lead to low oil levels, engine knocking, and potentially catastrophic engine damage. The problem often stems from worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the piston rings and/or valve stem seals. In severe cases, engine replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Pre-Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter, located in the exhaust manifold, can fail and disintegrate. This can cause pieces of the converter to be sucked back into the engine cylinders, leading to scored cylinder walls and engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the exhaust manifold, decreased engine performance, and potential engine failure.
    * Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold with a new or used unit (preferably without the pre-cat). Inspect the engine cylinders for damage. If damage is found, engine repair or replacement may be needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to become loose. This can lead to engine misfires, rough running, and potentially catastrophic engine damage if the chain jumps timing. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup.
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, timing chain, and associated components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**

* **Oil Leaks (Valve Covers, Oil Pan)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common from the valve cover gaskets and oil pan gasket. These leaks can cause oil to drip onto the exhaust, creating a burning smell, and can lead to low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets and/or oil pan gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission may experience slipping between gears, particularly when shifting from 2nd to 3rd gear. Harsh or delayed shifting can also occur.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid change may temporarily improve the issue, but often a transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $1,500 - $3,500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can manifest as shuddering or shaking at low speeds, particularly when accelerating from a stop. It can also cause the engine to stall.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The strut mounts, particularly the front ones, are prone to failure. Symptoms include clunking noises when driving over bumps, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace the strut mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The wheel bearings may fail. Symptoms include a grinding or humming noise that changes with vehicle speed, and looseness in the wheel.
    * Solution: Replace the wheel bearings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per wheel
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Check Engine Light (Various Sensors)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The check engine light is prone to illuminating due to various sensor failures, including oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and crankshaft position sensors.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific code and replace the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power window regulators can fail, causing the windows to not go up or down, or to operate erratically.
    * Solution: Replace the power window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust (Especially in Northern Climates)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust is a common problem, particularly in areas where salt is used on the roads. Rust can appear on the rocker panels, wheel wells, and undercarriage.
    * Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. Treat existing rust to prevent further spread.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+, depending on severity
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The dashboard is prone to cracking, especially in hot climates.
    * Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (cover) - $800+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Radio/Speaker Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Speakers may fail, or the radio may stop working or have intermittent issues.
    * Solution: Replace the speakers or radio unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Nissan Altima, while praised for its styling and performance, suffered from a number of reliability issues. The 2.5L engine is particularly prone to oil consumption and pre-catalytic converter problems, which can lead to significant engine damage and high repair costs. The 4-speed automatic transmission can also experience slipping and harsh shifting. Electrical and suspension issues are also common. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the cost of repairs when considering this vehicle.
