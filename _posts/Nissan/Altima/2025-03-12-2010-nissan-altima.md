The 2010 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and fuel efficiency. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 175 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5L V6 producing 270 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Common praises for the Altima include its spacious interior and smooth ride, while criticisms often target the CVT's reliability and the car's somewhat bland styling.

**Summary**

The 2010 Nissan Altima, while offering a comfortable ride and reasonable fuel economy, is plagued by some notable issues. The most significant concern is the high rate of CVT failures, which can be a costly repair. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption and timing chain problems (especially in the V6), also contribute to potential maintenance costs. Electrical and suspension issues are less severe but still require attention. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the possibility of significant repair expenses, particularly concerning the CVT.
