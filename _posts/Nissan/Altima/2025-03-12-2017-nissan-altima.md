The 2017 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It offers two engine options: a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 179 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 generating 270 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate the Altima's fuel efficiency and ease of driving, but common complaints often revolve around CVT reliability and some electrical issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: The fix varies depending on the severity and cause. It may involve replacing the PCV valve, valve stem seals, or piston rings. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV valve) - $3,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**
No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint is premature CVT failure. Symptoms include shuddering, hesitation during acceleration, slipping, jerking, and unusual noises. A check engine light may illuminate, indicating a transmission-related code.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT is often the only viable solution. In some cases, a software update may address minor issues, but this is not a guaranteed fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Electrical Relay**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel Pump, ECM, IPDM E relays failing causing the vehicle not to start or stall.
    *   Solution: Replace the relays
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain or failure, especially in colder climates. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or electrical system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery with a higher-quality or larger capacity unit may help. Also, checking for parasitic drains and addressing them can extend battery life.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported windshields cracking easily due to minor impacts or temperature changes.
    *   Solution: Windshield replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light Illumination**
    * Description/Symptoms: Airbag light illuminating on the dashboard, indicating a problem with the supplemental restraint system (SRS). This could be caused by a faulty sensor, wiring issue, or a problem with the airbag control module.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the SRS system, which may involve replacing a sensor, repairing wiring, or replacing the airbag control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Nissan Altima, while generally a comfortable and economical sedan, has some notable issues, primarily concerning CVT reliability. CVT failures can be costly. Other issues like excessive oil consumption on the 2.5L engine and electrical gremlins add to the potential ownership costs. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's history and condition, particularly the transmission, before purchasing.
