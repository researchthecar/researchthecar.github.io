The 2000 Nissan Altima was a popular sedan known for its reliability and affordability. Two engines were available: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 generating 240 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
