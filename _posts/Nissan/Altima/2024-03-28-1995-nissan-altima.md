**Introduction to the 1995 Nissan Altima**

The 1995 Nissan Altima was offered with two engine options: a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine producing 155 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0-liter V6 engine producing 190 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0-liter V6 engine was also available with a 5-speed manual transmission.

The Altima was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and responsive handling. However, it was criticized for its lack of power with the 2.4-liter engine and its poor fuel economy with the 3.0-liter V6 engine.
