**Introduction**

The 2005 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and plenty of features for a reasonable price. It is available with three different engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, a 3.5-liter V6, and a hybrid powertrain. The four-cylinder engine produces 175 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, while the V6 produces 240 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. The hybrid powertrain combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor to produce a combined 198 horsepower. All three engines are paired with a standard five-speed manual transmission, but a four-speed automatic transmission is available as an option.
