### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Nissan Altima is a reasonably reliable car, particularly with the manual transmission. However, owners should be mindful of potential issues with the 2.5L engine's oil consumption and crankshaft sensor, and the 3.5L V6's camshaft sensors. The CVT transmission is a known weak point and can be a significant repair cost if it fails. Suspension components and certain electrical items like the alternator and BCM can also require attention. Exterior paint issues and interior wear are also noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are key to maintaining this vehicle's longevity.
