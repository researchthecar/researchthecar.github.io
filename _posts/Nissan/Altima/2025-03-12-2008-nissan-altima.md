The 2008 Nissan Altima offered a blend of practicality and style, making it a popular choice for consumers. Available engines included a 2.5L inline-4 producing 175 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 outputting 270 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 6-speed manual (limited availability) and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praised the Altima for its fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.5L engine), comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Common dislikes included concerns about the CVT reliability, build quality, and some of the cheaper interior materials.

Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L and timing chain problems in the 3.5L, also contribute to higher running costs. Suspension and electrical problems are less severe but should still be considered. Overall, the Altima is a decent vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchase decision and maintenance budget.
