**Introduction to the 1996 Nissan Altima:**

The 1996 Nissan Altima is a midsize sedan offered with various engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 2.4-liter inline-four producing 150 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 3.0-liter V6 is also available, generating 190 horsepower and 206 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. Drivers appreciate the Altima's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and stylish design, but some have reported issues with certain components.

**Engine**

**2.4-liter inline-four**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** Symptoms may include coolant leaks, rough idling, and poor engine performance. Solution requires replacing the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost: $250 - $400
* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** Engine oil may leak from the valve cover, causing an oil smell and visible residue. Solution involves replacing the valve cover gasket. Estimated Cost: $100 - $200

**3.0-liter V6**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**5-speed manual**

* **Clutch Wear:** Over time, the clutch may wear out, resulting in difficulty shifting gears or a slipping clutch. Solution involves replacing the clutch and pressure plate. Estimated Cost: $600 - $1200

**4-speed automatic**

* **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Front Sway Bar Link Failure:** The front sway bar links may fail, leading to excessive noise and compromised handling. Replacement of the sway bar links is necessary. Estimated Cost: $100 - $200 per link
* **Strut Mount Wear:** Strut mounts can wear out, causing excessive noise and vibrations. Replacing the strut mounts is required. Estimated Cost: $300 - $600 for all four mounts

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may fail, resulting in a loss of electrical power. Replacement of the alternator is necessary. Estimated Cost: $400 - $800
* **Starter Solenoid Failure:** Starter solenoid may fail, preventing the engine from starting. Replacement of the starter solenoid is required. Estimated Cost: $200 - $300
* **Battery Terminal Corrosion:** Battery terminals may corrode, causing poor electrical connections. Cleaning or replacing the terminals is necessary. Estimated Cost: $50 - $150

**Exterior**

* **Door Handle Breakage:** Door handles may break due to wear or impact, making it difficult to open the doors. Replacement of the door handles is necessary. Estimated Cost: $100 - $200 per handle
* **Trunk Lid Rust:** The trunk lid may rust, leading to compromised structural integrity. Rust removal and repainting are necessary. Estimated Cost: $500 - $1000

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking:** The dashboard may crack due to sun exposure or temperature fluctuations. Replacement of the dashboard is necessary. Estimated Cost: $400 - $800
* **Power Window Failure:** Power window motors or switches may fail, preventing the windows from operating. Replacement of the faulty components is necessary. Estimated Cost: $200 - $500 per window
* **Air Bag Warning Light Illumination:** Air bag warning light may illuminate due to faulty wiring or sensor issues. Diagnostic and repair of the affected components are necessary. Estimated Cost: $200 - $600

**Summary:**

The 1996 Nissan Altima is a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with certain components. Common engine issues include intake and valve cover gasket leaks, particularly in the 2.4-liter inline-four. Transmission concerns are isolated to the 5-speed manual, primarily due to clutch wear. Suspension issues involve worn sway bar links and strut mounts. Electrical issues may arise due to alternator failure or starter solenoid failure. Exterior problems include broken door handles and trunk lid rust. Interior issues primarily involve dashboard cracking, power window failure, and air bag warning light illumination. While some issues can be costly to fix, others can be resolved relatively inexpensively. Regular maintenance and address potential issues early on can help extend the lifespan of the vehicle and reduce overall repair costs.
