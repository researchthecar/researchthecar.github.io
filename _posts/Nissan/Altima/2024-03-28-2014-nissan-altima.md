**Introduction:**

The 2014 Nissan Altima is a midsize sedan that was available with three engine options: a 2.5L inline-4, a 3.5L V6, and a 2.5L inline-4 hybrid. It had multiple transmission options depending on the engine, including a CVT, a 6-speed manual, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Altima was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and efficient powertrains. However, owners reported some common issues that affected different components of the vehicle.

**Engine**

* **2.5L Inline-4**
    * **Intake Valve Deposits:** Buildup of deposits on the intake valves can lead to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and rough idling. Solution: Cleaning the intake valves is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400+
    * **Timing Chain Rattle:** The timing chain can rattle or make noise at high mileage. Solution: Replacing the timing chain and related components is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000-$2,000+
* **3.5L V6**
    * **Oil Consumption:** Some vehicles may experience excessive oil consumption, leading to frequent oil top-ups. Solution: Nissan extended the warranty for 2013-2014 Altimas with this issue. Repairs may vary depending on the severity. Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 under warranty, or hundreds of dollars if issue persists past warranty period.
* **2.5L Inline-4 Hybrid**
    * **Battery Failure:** The hybrid battery can fail prematurely, resulting in reduced performance or inability to start the vehicle. Solution: Replacing the hybrid battery is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000-$4,000+

**Transmission**

* **CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
    * **Slippage:** The CVT may experience slippage, leading to a loss of power and acceleration issues. Solution: Replacing the CVT is often required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000-$5,000+
* **6-Speed Manual**
    * **Difficulty Shifting:** Some vehicles may experience difficulty shifting gears, especially in cold weather. Solution: Servicing the transmission or replacing components may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+
