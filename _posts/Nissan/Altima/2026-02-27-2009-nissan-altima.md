### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Nissan Altima presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.5L V6 engine and manual transmission variants are generally more robust. However, the 2.5L engine can suffer from oil consumption and VVT issues, while the CVT transmission is a known weak point prone to overheating and failure. Suspension components like wheel bearings and strut mounts may require attention. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and key fobs, are also reported. Exterior paint and interior wear are common for its age. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in potential repair costs, especially if considering a model with the 2.5L engine and CVT.
