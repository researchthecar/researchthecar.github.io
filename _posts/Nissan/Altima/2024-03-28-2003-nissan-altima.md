**Introduction:**

The 2003 Nissan Altima is a midsize sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. It is powered by a choice of two engines: a 2.5-liter inline-4 or a 3.5-liter V6, paired with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. The Altima is known for its reliability, but it is not without its issues.

**Engine**

**2.5-liter Inline-4**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket may fail, causing a vacuum leak and engine performance issues. Symptoms include rough idling, loss of power, and increased emissions. Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner may fail, causing the timing chain to skip and potentially damaging the engine. Symptoms include engine knocking, rattling, or stalling. Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Valve cover gasket leak:** The valve cover gasket may leak oil. Symptoms include an oily smell in the engine bay and smoke from the exhaust. Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**3.5-liter V6**

* **Oil consumption:** The 3.5-liter V6 engine may consume excessive oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. Symptoms include low oil level warnings on the dashboard and increased oil consumption between oil changes. Solution: Fix the engine defect. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
* **Catalytic converter failure:** The catalytic converter may fail, causing reduced engine performance and increased emissions. Symptoms include decreased acceleration, check engine light illumination, and a rotten egg smell from the exhaust. Solution: Replace the catalytic converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip, causing a loss of power and difficulty shifting gears. Symptoms include delayed gear engagement, slipping gears, and shuddering during acceleration. Solution: Replace or rebuild the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter may fail, causing a loss of power and transmission overheating. Symptoms include slipping gears, shuddering, and stalling. Solution: Replace the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch may wear out prematurely, causing difficulty shifting gears or a loss of power. Symptoms include slipping gears, grinding noises when shifting, and difficulty engaging gears. Solution: Replace the clutch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+
* **Synchro failure:** The synchronizers may fail, causing difficulty shifting gears or grinding noises. Symptoms include difficult gear engagement, grinding noises when shifting, and popped-out gears. Solution: Replace the synchronizers. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

* **Strut failure:** The struts may wear out or fail, causing a rough ride and decreased handling. Symptoms include excessive bouncing, uneven tire wear, and a clunking noise when driving over bumps. Solution: Replace the struts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per axle

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** The battery may drain prematurely due to a parasitic draw. Symptoms include a dead battery after sitting for a few days, dim headlights, and flickering interior lights. Solution: Find and fix the source of the parasitic draw. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
* **Alternator failure:** The alternator may fail, leading to a loss of power and a dead battery. Symptoms include dim headlights, flickering interior lights, and a warning light on the dashboard. Solution: Replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Body panel rust:** The body panels may rust, especially in areas exposed to salt or moisture. Symptoms include bubbling or peeling paint, rust spots, and holes in the body panels. Solution: Repair or replace the rusted body panels. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

**Interior**

* **Climate control failure:** The climate control system may fail, leading to inadequate heating or cooling. Symptoms include inconsistent temperature, malfunctioning fans, and no airflow. Solution: Repair or replace the climate control system. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Power window failure:** The power windows may fail, preventing them from opening or closing properly. Symptoms include windows that do not move, windows that move slowly, or windows that fall off the track. Solution: Repair or replace the power window motors or switches. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
* **Seat belt retractor failure:** The seat belt retractor may fail, preventing the seat belt from retracting or locking properly. Symptoms include difficulty buckling or unbuckling the seat belt or a seat belt that does not retract fully. Solution: Replace the seat belt retractor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Summary**

The 2003 Nissan Altima has several potential issues, but most are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix. However, the 3.5-liter V6 engine's oil consumption and catalytic converter failure can be major problems that are costly to repair. Additionally, the vehicle's electrical system is known for battery drain and alternator failure, which can also be inconvenient and expensive to fix.
