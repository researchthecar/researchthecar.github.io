The 2022 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan offering a blend of comfort, fuel efficiency, and modern technology. The base engine is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 188 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. An optional 2.0-liter VC-Turbo four-cylinder engine is available, generating 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many drivers appreciate the Altima's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. However, some criticisms include the CVT's performance and a somewhat bland driving experience compared to some rivals.

**Engine**

**2.5L Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil regularly.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any leaks. If consumption is excessive, diagnostics to check for worn piston rings, valve seals, or other internal engine issues may be necessary. A leak-down test and compression test can help pinpoint the issue. In severe cases, engine repair or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the extent of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L VC-Turbo Four-Cylinder**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**CVT (Both Engine Options)**

*   **CVT judder/shudder at low speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a juddering or shuddering sensation, especially at lower speeds during acceleration. This may feel like hesitation or a slight vibration.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change may temporarily alleviate the issue, but in some cases, the CVT may need to be replaced. Ensure that the correct Nissan CVT fluid is used, as using aftermarket fluid can worsen the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change: $200-$400. CVT replacement: $3000 - $8000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of some CVT transmissions failing at lower mileage than expected. Symptoms include slipping, inability to accelerate, unusual noises, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $8000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of the struts/shocks, leading to a bouncy ride and reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per axle (depending on location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Software Glitches with Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may exhibit glitches, such as freezing, slow response times, or intermittent connectivity issues with smartphones via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Restarting the system, software updates (if available), or in some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1500+ (infotainment unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Sensors (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Lane Departure Warning)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sensors related to driver-assist features may malfunction, leading to false alarms or a complete failure of the system. This can impact the functionality of blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, and automatic emergency braking.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to identify the faulty sensor and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking from Dashboard or Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the noise and adding insulation or tightening loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Nissan Altima, while generally reliable, can experience some common issues. The most concerning are related to the CVT transmission, with reports of juddering and premature failures. Oil consumption in the 2.5L engine is also a potential issue. Electrical glitches and interior rattles are less severe but can be frustrating. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements or fluid changes to several thousand for transmission or engine repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle, especially the transmission, before purchasing.
