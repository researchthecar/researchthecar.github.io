The 2015 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5-liter V6 producing 270 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Altima's spacious interior and smooth ride, but some dislike the CVT's performance and perceived lack of responsiveness, as well as some reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: The specific fix depends on the cause of the oil consumption. Potential repairs include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the extent of damage and the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail prematurely, leading to a check engine light and potentially affecting emissions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the timing chain tensioner. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and potential engine damage if the timing chain jumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is prone to failure, causing symptoms such as shuddering, slipping, hesitation during acceleration, and complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the CVT transmission. Nissan extended the warranty on some CVTs, so check with your dealer to see if it qualifies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride comfort, excessive bouncing, and decreased handling performance. Leaking fluid from the struts/shocks is also a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000 (for a pair, front or rear)
    *   Recalls: None Found
