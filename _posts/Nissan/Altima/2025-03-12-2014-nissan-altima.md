The 2014 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 182 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing around 270 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Altima's spacious interior and smooth ride, but some dislike the CVT's droning noise and reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may also lead to the engine misfiring.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings helped resolve the issue. However, in severe cases, complete engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+

**Transmission**

**CVT (Both Engine Options)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT is prone to failure or malfunction, often exhibiting symptoms like shuddering, slipping, hesitation, and a general lack of responsiveness. In many cases, the transmission will fail completely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT is typically the only option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000
    *   Recalls: Recall Number: PC352 and PC351 are related to a software issue that causes the transmission to enter a failsafe mode.

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension components, such as struts, shocks, and bushings, leading to a bouncy ride, clunking noises, and reduced handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported instances of the car battery draining overnight or within a short period, leading to starting problems. This could be caused by faulty electronics draining the battery.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing or replacing the faulty component causing the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Issues with the Blind Spot Monitoring System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sometimes the blind spot monitoring system may have issues causing it to not function properly, or causing it to give false alerts.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan Altima, while generally reliable, has some notable issues, particularly concerning the CVT transmission. The CVT problems are potentially the most severe and costly, potentially requiring complete transmission replacement. The oil consumption issue in the 2.5L engine is also a concern. Suspension and electrical issues are less severe but can still lead to unexpected repair bills. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase.
