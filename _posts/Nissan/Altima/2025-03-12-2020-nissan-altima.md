The 2020 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and fuel efficiency. The base engine is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 182 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 2.0-liter VC-Turbo engine is also available, delivering 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). People often praise the Altima for its spacious interior and user-friendly technology, but some dislike the CVT's performance and the sometimes-uninspired handling.
