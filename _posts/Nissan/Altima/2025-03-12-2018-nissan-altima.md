The 2018 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It came with two engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 179 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 270 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate the Altima's fuel efficiency and smooth ride, while common complaints revolve around CVT reliability and some interior quality issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Cylinder**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the 2.5L engine consumes excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, engine knocking or ticking, and blue exhaust smoke.
    * Solution: The most common solution is to closely monitor oil levels and add oil as needed. More extensive repairs may involve replacing valve seals or piston rings. In extreme cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature failure of the engine mounts, leading to excessive engine vibration, especially at idle and during acceleration.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failed engine mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 Cylinder**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

* **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is prone to issues such as shuddering, slipping, hesitation during acceleration, and complete failure. Warning lights, such as the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL), may illuminate.
    * Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the CVT. In some cases, a software update may temporarily alleviate symptoms, but often a replacement is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+

* **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience hesitation or jerking during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can make driving feel rough and unpredictable.
    * Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change can improve performance. However, more serious cases may require CVT replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature failure of the struts and shocks, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased noise over bumps.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failed struts and shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the car sits for extended periods.
    * Solution: Thoroughly test the battery and charging system. Replace the battery if it is faulty. Inspect the electrical system for parasitic draws and address any identified issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failure (ABS, TPMS, etc.)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Failure of various sensors, such as the ABS sensor or TPMS sensor, can trigger warning lights on the dashboard and affect vehicle functionality.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the specific sensor failure and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found
