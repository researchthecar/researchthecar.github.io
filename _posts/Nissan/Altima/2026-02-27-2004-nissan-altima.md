### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Nissan Altima is a generally dependable sedan, particularly if equipped with the V6 engine, which tends to be more robust than the early versions of the 2.5L. Key areas to inspect are potential oil consumption in both engines, which can be a significant repair if neglected. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can arise and require attention. Suspension components like bushings and strut mounts are common wear items that may need replacement. Electrical issues, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, are also noted. Despite these potential concerns, many 2004 Altimas have provided years of service with proper maintenance, making it a reasonable used car choice with careful pre-purchase inspection.
