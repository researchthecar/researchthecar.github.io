The 2024 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy. It's available with two engine options: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine making 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate the Altima's spacious interior, comfortable seats, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common criticisms include the somewhat uninspired driving dynamics and the lack of a traditional automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2024 Nissan Altima, while generally reliable, has shown some issues reported by owners. The most prevalent of these are related to the CVT and infotainment system. Engine issues are less common, but excessive oil consumption has been reported by some owners of the 2.5L engine. The severity of the issues ranges from minor annoyances (rattling noises) to more serious concerns (CVT failure, AEB malfunctions), with repair costs varying accordingly. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider them when evaluating the vehicle.
