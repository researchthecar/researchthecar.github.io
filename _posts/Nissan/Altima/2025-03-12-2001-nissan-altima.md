The 2001 Nissan Altima marked a significant shift for the model, moving from a compact to a mid-size sedan. Engine options included a 2.4-liter inline-4 (KA24DE) producing around 150 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 (VQ35DE) producing 240 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Altima's sporty handling and comfortable ride for the time. Common dislikes often centered around interior plastic quality and some reliability concerns as the vehicle aged.

**Summary**

The 2001 Nissan Altima can be a decent car, but potential buyers should be aware of potential issues. The V6 engine, while offering more power, has a higher risk of catalytic converter failure and oil consumption. The automatic transmission can also present problems as the vehicle ages. Rust, particularly in areas with harsh winters, can be a significant concern. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine or transmission work, can be costly.
