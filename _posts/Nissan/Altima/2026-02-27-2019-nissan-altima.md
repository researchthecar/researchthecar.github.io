# 2019 Nissan Altima

### Overview
The 2019 Nissan Altima, a mid-size sedan, offers a blend of comfort, technology, and performance, aiming to compete strongly in its segment. It features two engine options: a standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder and an optional 2.0-liter variable compression turbo (VC-Turbo) four-cylinder. Both are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Altima received a redesign for this model year, introducing Nissan's 'Intelligent Mobility' features and available all-wheel drive (AWD) on some trims. Reliability data suggests a generally positive owner experience, with most common issues being minor and related to specific component performance rather than widespread systemic failures. Owners generally appreciate the fuel efficiency and comfortable ride, though some long-term durability concerns have been noted.

### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Nissan Altima generally presents a reliable profile, particularly with its standard 2.5-liter engine. The optional 2.0L VC-Turbo engine, while offering enhanced performance, has a higher potential for specific issues related to its advanced variable compression technology. The CVT, common across most modern Nissans, can occasionally exhibit minor drivability quirks, but widespread catastrophic failures are not a dominant concern. Electrical issues, primarily with the infotainment system and occasional battery longevity, are the most frequently cited minor annoyances. Overall, for owners seeking a comfortable and fuel-efficient sedan, the Altima is a solid choice, with the 2.5L engine variant being the most straightforward in terms of long-term reliability.
