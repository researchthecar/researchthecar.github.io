# 2018 Nissan Altima

### Overview
The 2018 Nissan Altima, a mid-size sedan, generally presents a respectable reliability record, particularly for its powertrain. It was offered with two engine choices, a standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder and an optional 2.5-liter V6 (though the V6 was phased out for the 2018 model year, the 2.5L was the primary engine). The continuously variable transmission (CVT) is a common feature across the lineup. While most owners report a smooth and dependable driving experience, some specific areas have seen occasional reports of issues, primarily related to the CVT and certain electrical components. Overall, the Altima is considered a solid choice for those seeking a practical and reasonably reliable vehicle.
