The 2023 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and fuel efficiency. It comes standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 188 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, delivering 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, is available on higher trims. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Altima for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and user-friendly technology, but some criticize its somewhat uninspired styling and the performance of the base engine.
