The 2021 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and good fuel economy. The base engine is a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 188 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. An optional 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, generating 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, is also available. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Altima's spacious interior, smooth ride, and fuel efficiency. Common dislikes include the uninspiring handling and the droning sound of the CVT.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning light, engine noise, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the complexity of the repair and any water damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Nissan Altima can have a few common issues, the most significant being potential CVT failures, excessive oil consumption, and issues with the infotainment system. CVT failure can be the most expensive repair. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs can help mitigate some of these issues.
