The 2011 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-4 producing 175 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 270 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual (mostly on the 2.5L) and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) for both engine options. Owners often appreciate the Altima's spacious interior and smooth ride, but common complaints include issues with the CVT transmission and some electrical problems.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2.5L engines experience excessive oil consumption, leading to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and the need for frequent oil top-offs. Symptoms can include the low oil pressure light illuminating, engine knocking, and visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can reduce oil consumption. In more severe cases, a complete engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and repair approach.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**
No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is known to be problematic in the 2011 Altima. Symptoms include shuddering during acceleration, hesitation, slipping, erratic shifting, and complete transmission failure. The transmission warning light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve minor issues. More severe cases require complete CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls:
    *   Recall Number: PC023
    *   Recall Date: 2010-06-17
    *   Description: CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSIONS (CVT) MAY EXPERIENCE A MALFUNCTION OF THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL UNIT (TCU) SOFTWARE WHICH COULD CAUSE A DELAY IN THE RESUMPTION OF FORWARD PROPULSION WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE AFTER COMING TO A STOP.

**6-Speed Manual**
No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the struts and shock absorbers wear out more quickly than expected. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, poor handling, and clunking noises over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and/or shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Camshaft/Crankshaft Position Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may stall or fail to start due to faulty camshaft or crankshaft position sensors. The check engine light may illuminate with corresponding trouble codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per sensor (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Mass Air Flow Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine can run rough, have poor acceleration, or stall out. Check engine light may come on.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the airbag system to identify the faulty component, followed by replacement or repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the component and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2011 Nissan Altima, particularly models equipped with the CVT, can present owners with some significant issues. The CVT transmission is the most prevalent and potentially expensive problem. Excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine is also a concern. Electrical issues, while less common, can also be a nuisance. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and repair costs can vary widely. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history, pay close attention to the transmission's performance during a test drive, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
