The 2019 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan offering a comfortable ride and stylish design. Two engine options were available: a 2.5L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L VC-Turbo inline-4 producing 248 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Altima's fuel efficiency and spacious interior, but some dislike the CVT's performance and reported issues with certain components.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms can include the low oil pressure light illuminating, the engine running rough, and eventually engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: The issue is difficult to diagnose. It can be caused by worn piston rings or valve seals. Depending on the severity, solutions can range from using a higher viscosity oil, replacing the PCV valve, to performing an engine overhaul or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV valve) - $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration and unusual noises, especially during acceleration or deceleration, could indicate worn or broken engine mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty engine mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L VC-Turbo Inline-4**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the turbocharger, including premature failure or reduced boost pressure. Symptoms may include a loss of power, unusual whistling noises from the engine, and the check engine light illuminating.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Both Engine Options)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint involves the CVT, with reports of shuddering, slipping, hesitation during acceleration, and complete transmission failure. This can manifest as delayed engagement, erratic shifting, or the inability to accelerate properly.
    *   Solution: In many cases, the CVT requires a complete replacement. Some owners have had success with valve body replacements or software updates, but this is not a guaranteed fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or high-pitched noise emanating from the transmission, particularly during acceleration.
    *   Solution: While some noise is considered normal, excessive whining often indicates internal wear and may necessitate CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and unusual noises (clunking or squeaking) when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or a parasitic drain that causes the battery to die overnight.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the drain. This may involve replacing the battery, alternator, or addressing a faulty electrical component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently.
    * Solution: Software updates may resolve the issue. In other cases, replacement of the head unit might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,000+ (Head Unit Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Blind Spot Monitoring, etc.)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Malfunction of driver-assistance features, like blind spot monitoring, often due to sensor failure. This is indicated by warning lights.
    * Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) System Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False activation of the AEB system, causing the vehicle to brake unnecessarily.
    *   Solution: Recalibration or replacement of the AEB sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: **Recall Number: PC792** (This recall addresses issues where the radar sensor may have been misadjusted during pre-delivery inspection, potentially causing the AEB system to not function as intended. This recall is specifically for the AEB system.)

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Warning Light Illumination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty component, which may include the airbag module, clock spring, or seat position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may leak or get stuck in the open or closed position.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, track, or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Nissan Altima, while appreciated for its comfort and fuel efficiency, faces notable issues, particularly with its CVT transmission. The CVT problems are the most concerning due to their potential for high repair costs and significant impact on the vehicle's reliability. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine and turbocharger problems in the 2.0L VC-Turbo, also contribute to owner complaints. While some issues can be resolved with relatively inexpensive fixes, others, such as CVT replacements, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing.
