### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Nissan Altima, particularly models equipped with the 2.5L engine and CVT transmission, shows a tendency towards specific issues. The most frequently reported problems involve the CVT transmission's longevity and potential oil consumption in the 2.5L engine. While the 3.5L V6 engine appears more robust, the CVT remains a point of concern across both powertrains. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and infotainment system are also noted, though less common. Overall, the Altima offers a comfortable and efficient driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of the CVT's historical performance and consider vehicles with a well-documented maintenance history, especially regarding transmission fluid changes.
