### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Nissan Altima presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.5L V6 engine is generally robust, but the 2.5L four-cylinder has known issues with oil consumption and timing chain wear, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions can also develop issues with harsh shifting or slipping. Electrical problems, particularly with the Body Control Module and alternator, are not uncommon. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components tend to hold up well. Prospective buyers should be particularly aware of the potential engine and transmission concerns with the 2.5L model and ensure any vehicle inspected has a clean bill of health in these areas.
