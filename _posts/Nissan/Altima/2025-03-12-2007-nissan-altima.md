The 2007 Nissan Altima is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 producing around 175 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 generating approximately 270 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine is typically paired with either a 6-speed manual or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), while the 3.5L engine is generally paired with the CVT. Common praises for the Altima include its sporty handling (especially with the V6), spacious interior, and relatively affordable price point. Complaints often center around the CVT's reliability, build quality, and some reported issues with excessive oil consumption in certain engines.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report high oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled changes. This can manifest as a burning oil smell, blue smoke from the exhaust, or low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause is crucial. It could stem from worn piston rings, faulty valve seals, or PCV valve issues. Repairs may involve replacing the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and affected parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Decreased fuel economy, illuminated check engine light (often with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency), rattling noise from the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. Ensure the replacement is CARB compliant if required in your state.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup or during acceleration. Illuminated check engine light may also occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Both 2.5L and 3.5L Engines)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation upon acceleration, jerky movements, slipping, whining noise from the transmission, inability to shift gears, or complete transmission failure. The CVT warning light may also illuminate.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid change and CVT relearn procedure may temporarily alleviate symptoms. However, often requires a CVT replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ for replacement; $2,000 - $4,000+ for rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or knocking noise coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per pair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Fuel Gauge Inaccuracy**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel gauge showing incorrect fuel levels, potentially leading to running out of gas unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: The fuel sending unit is faulty and needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing devices, intermittent disconnections, or complete failure of the Bluetooth system.
    *   Solution: Could be a software glitch and can sometimes be resolved with resetting the system. If that doesn't work, the Bluetooth module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the issue and whether a new module is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on rear quarter panel**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the inside of the rear quarter panel.
    *   Solution: Remove the rust and repair/replace the panel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the solution chosen.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2007 Nissan Altima has some notable issues. The most significant concern is the CVT transmission, which is prone to failure and can be very expensive to repair or replace. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption and timing chain problems, are also relatively common, especially with higher mileage. Electrical issues and suspension components add to the potential ownership costs. Overall, while the Altima offers a comfortable ride and stylish design, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase.
