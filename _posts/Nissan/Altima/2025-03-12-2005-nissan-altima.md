The 2005 Nissan Altima was a popular mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.5-liter inline-4 and a 3.5-liter V6. The 2.5L produced around 175 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. People generally liked the Altima's styling and available power, particularly with the V6. Common dislikes included some reported reliability issues and interior quality concerns.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 (QR25DE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings is the typical fix to try to help combat the oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Pre-Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The pre-catalytic converter, located in the exhaust manifold, can degrade and disintegrate. Debris can then be sucked back into the engine, causing damage to the cylinder walls and piston rings, and leading to increased oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifold with a redesigned unit that eliminates the pre-cat or replaces it with a less fragile unit. Also, repairing any engine damage resulting from the debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ depending on the extent of engine damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to a loose timing chain. Symptoms include a rattling noise, especially on start-up, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner, timing chain, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per leak depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (RE4F04A/RE4F04B) (Primarily paired with the 2.5L)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body, performing a transmission rebuild, or replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $3,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (RE5F22A) (Primarily paired with the 3.5L)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, stalling, or poor acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or popping noises when turning the steering wheel or going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or during acceleration/braking.
    *   Solution: Replacing the control arm bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, check engine light illuminated.
    *   Solution: Replacing the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Camshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, rough idle, check engine light illuminated.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, battery light illuminated, difficulty starting, or complete electrical failure.

**Summary**

The 2005 Nissan Altima can suffer from a range of issues, from engine and transmission problems to suspension and electrical faults. Engine issues, particularly oil consumption in the 2.5L and timing chain problems in the 3.5L, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues can also be significant expenses. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be substantial, potentially making the overall cost of ownership higher than expected. Addressing these potential issues proactively can help extend the vehicle's lifespan and prevent more significant problems down the road.
