**Introduction:**

The 2003 Nissan Murano is a mid-size crossover SUV that offers a spacious interior, powerful engine performance, and a stylish exterior design. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 245 horsepower and 246 pound-feet of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

The Murano is praised for its comfort, handling, and versatility. However, it has also received some criticism for its high fuel consumption and limited cargo space.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

- **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption is a common issue, especially in vehicles with high mileage. Symptoms include low oil levels, smoking from the exhaust, and decreased engine performance. The fix involves replacing the piston rings, which can cost around $1,000 - $2,000+.
- **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to slip and potentially damaging the engine. Symptoms include rattling noises from the engine and decreased performance. Replacing the timing chain tensioner costs around $500 - $1,000+.

**Transmission**

**CVT**

- **Slipping:** The CVT may slip, causing hesitation and reduced performance. Symptoms include a lack of acceleration and jerking during gear changes. Repairing the CVT can be costly, ranging from $2,000 - $4,000+.
- **Shuddering:** Some Muranos experience shuddering during gear changes. This issue can be addressed by replacing the CVT fluid and filter, which costs around $200 - $300+.

**Suspension**

- **Premature Strut Failure:** Front struts can wear out prematurely, leading to decreased ride quality, uneven tire wear, and poor handling. Replacing struts costs around $600 - $800+ for the parts and labor.
- **Rear Sway Bar Bushing Failure:** The rear sway bar bushings can fail, causing clunking or rattling noises from the suspension. Replacing the bushings costs around $150 - $300+.

**Electrical**

- **Battery Drain:** Some Muranos experience battery drain issues that can lead to a dead battery. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle and dim interior lights. The issue can be traced to a faulty alternator, battery, or wiring harness. Repairs can cost anywhere from $100 - $500+.
- **Door Lock Module Failure:** The door lock module can fail, preventing doors from locking or unlocking properly. Replacing the module costs around $200 - $400+.

**Exterior**

- **Door Handle Paint Peeling:** The paint on the door handles can peel over time, affecting their appearance. Touching up the paint or replacing the handles is an option, with costs varying depending on the method chosen.

**Interior**

- **HVAC Fan Control Switch Failure:** The HVAC fan control switch can fail, preventing the fan from operating properly. Replacing the switch costs around $100 - $200+.
- **Satellite Radio Antenna Failure:** The satellite radio antenna can fail, resulting in poor or no reception. Replacing the antenna costs around $150 - $250+.

**Summary**

The 2003 Nissan Murano has received overall positive reviews for its comfort, handling, and versatility. However, it has some potential issues that buyers should be aware of, such as oil consumption, timing chain tensioner failure, and CVT problems. While some repairs can be costly, others are relatively straightforward and affordable.
