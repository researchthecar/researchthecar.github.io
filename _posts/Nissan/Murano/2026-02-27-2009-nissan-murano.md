### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Nissan Murano, particularly with its 3.5L V6 engine, is generally a dependable vehicle. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the CVT transmission, which can be costly to repair if problems arise. Engine oil and coolant leaks are also noted, though often manageable.
