## 2007 Nissan Murano

The 2007 Nissan Murano is a mid-size crossover SUV that was offered with two engine options: a 3.5L V6 and a 2.5L I4. The 3.5L V6 produced 265 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.5L I4 produced 166 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque. The 3.5L V6 was paired with a standard 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.5L I4 was paired with a standard CVT. The Murano also received a facelift for the 2007 model year, which included a new grille, headlights, and taillights.
