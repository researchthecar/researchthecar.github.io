The 2010 Nissan Murano is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride and stylish design. All 2010 Murano models came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 265 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Murano's comfortable interior and smooth ride, but common complaints include CVT issues, electrical problems, and higher than expected repair costs.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored and corrected.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels and addressing any leaks. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially in colder weather. This indicates the timing chain tensioner is failing and not properly tensioning the timing chain. If left unaddressed, this can lead to serious engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner, timing chain, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping, hesitation during acceleration, jerking, inability to accelerate, and complete transmission failure. The CVT transmission is a known weak point in this generation Murano.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT transmission. In some cases, a rebuild may be possible, but replacement is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, hesitation, jerking, and general poor transmission performance. The valve body controls fluid pressure within the CVT, and issues here can cause various driveability problems.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll, and clunking noises coming from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing the struts and shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Humming or grinding noise that increases with vehicle speed. Noise might change when turning.
    *   Solution: Replacing the wheel bearing assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a few days, preventing the vehicle from starting. Possible causes include a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working, or move slowly and erratically.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The liftgate will not stay open on its own and falls down.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Navigation system freezes, displays incorrect information, or fails completely.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the navigation system unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on repair vs replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Nissan Murano can be a comfortable and stylish vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to the CVT transmission. Engine issues like oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failure can also be costly to address. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major issues such as transmission or engine failure can lead to significant repair bills. A thorough inspection, including a CVT health check, is recommended before purchasing a used 2010 Murano.
