The 2019 Nissan Murano is a mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride, stylish design, and upscale interior. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 260 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Murano for its smooth ride, comfortable seats, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some common complaints include CVT issues, electrical problems, and issues with the automatic emergency braking system.

**Engine**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Transmission Failure/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint is CVT failure, often manifested as shuddering, hesitation during acceleration, jerking, and eventually, complete transmission failure. The issue may be related to the valve body, torque converter, or internal CVT components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT unit is the most common solution. Some owners have had success with valve body replacements, but this is less common and less likely to fully resolve the issue.

    *   Solution: Recalibration or replacement of the AEB sensor/module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: Some 2019 Muranos had a recall (PC864) related to the Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system.

**Summary**

The 2019 Nissan Murano faces some notable issues, primarily revolving around the CVT transmission and electrical systems. CVT problems can be severe and costly to repair. Electrical issues, especially those relating to the AEB system, can compromise safety. While the Murano offers a comfortable and stylish ride, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, especially focusing on the condition of the CVT. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major component replacements like the transmission or engine.
