### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Nissan Murano is a capable crossover with a generally decent reliability record, particularly regarding its powertrain. However, potential buyers and owners should be mindful of specific issues that have been reported. The CVT transmission is the most significant concern, with potential for costly repairs if not maintained properly or if it develops faults. Engine oil and coolant leaks are also common but typically less severe. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and instrument cluster, along with common exterior wear like clear coat peeling and interior component failures such as the HVAC blower motor, are also points to consider. Regular maintenance, especially on the CVT, is crucial for longevity.
