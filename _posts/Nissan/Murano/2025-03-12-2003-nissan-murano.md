The 2003 Nissan Murano marked Nissan's entry into the crossover SUV market, offering a blend of car-like handling with SUV practicality. A single engine option was available: a 3.5-liter V6 (VQ35DE) producing around 245 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praised its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and distinctive styling. Common complaints centered around the reliability of the CVT, premature wear of suspension components, and some electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. This indicates worn or failing timing chain tensioners, which can lead to timing chain failure and severe engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes excessive amounts of oil between oil changes, requiring frequent topping off. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    * Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions range from using a higher viscosity oil and replacing the PCV valve to more extensive repairs like piston ring replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve) - $3,000+ (Piston Rings)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Jerking, slipping, hesitation during acceleration, whining noises, and eventual complete transmission failure. The "Service Engine Soon" light may illuminate with transmission-related error codes.
    * Solution: In many cases, the only reliable solution is complete CVT replacement. Some specialized shops may attempt rebuilds, but success is not guaranteed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This indicates a failing torque converter.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or knocking noises coming from the suspension when driving over bumps. Worn or damaged strut mounts are a common cause.

    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Wheel Bearing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Growling or humming noise from the rear of the vehicle that increases with speed.
    * Solution: Replace the affected rear wheel bearing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+ (per wheel)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) Sensor Failure**

**Summary**

The 2003 Nissan Murano is prone to several issues, with the CVT being the most significant and costly concern. Engine-related problems like timing chain tensioner failure and oil consumption can also be expensive to address. Suspension and electrical issues, while less severe, can still contribute to overall maintenance costs. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the CVT's condition and be prepared for potential repairs.
