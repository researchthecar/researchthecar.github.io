### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Nissan Murano presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.5L V6 engine is generally robust, but owners should be aware of potential oil and coolant leaks as the vehicle ages. The CVT transmission is a significant point of concern, with reports of hesitation, shuddering, and overheating, which can lead to costly repairs. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, such as power window failures and instrument cluster problems, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are less prone to major technical failures, the transmission and some engine components warrant careful inspection and maintenance.
