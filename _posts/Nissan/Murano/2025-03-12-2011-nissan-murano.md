The 2011 Nissan Murano is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride and stylish design. The Murano came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (VQ35DE) producing 260 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). People generally appreciate the Murano for its comfortable interior, smooth ride, and distinctive styling. Some common dislikes include the CVT transmission's feel and potential reliability concerns, and the vehicle's somewhat limited cargo space compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (VQ35DE)**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. May notice blue smoke from the exhaust, indicating oil burning.
    * Solution: In some cases, piston rings or valve stem seals replacement may be necessary. A compression test and leak-down test are recommended to diagnose the root cause.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of the repairs and shop rates).

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

* **Transmission Slipping/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or slipping during acceleration, especially at higher speeds. The transmission may feel jerky or unresponsive.
    * Solution: A CVT fluid flush may provide temporary relief, but often the CVT requires replacement or rebuild. The valve body can sometimes be replaced separately, but it is not always a guaranteed fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+ for a fluid flush, $800 - $1,500 for a valve body replacement, $3,000 - $6,000+ for a CVT replacement or rebuild.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure. The vehicle may not move at all, or the transmission may make loud noises.
    * Solution: Full transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bumpy ride, excessive bouncing, and clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. The vehicle may also exhibit poor handling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected struts or shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per strut/shock, depending on location (front/rear) and labor rates.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a few days, leading to difficulty starting the car.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the parasitic draw causing the drain. Common causes include faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain and labor).

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery light on the dashboard, dimming headlights, difficulty starting, and eventually complete electrical failure.
    * Solution: Alternator replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (including parts and labor).

**Exterior**

* **Rear Hatch Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch fails to stay open on its own and falls down.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear hatch struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof becomes stuck, makes grinding noises when opening or closing, or leaks.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the issue. May require cleaning and lubrication of the tracks, replacement of the motor, or replacement of the entire sunroof assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.

The 2011 Nissan Murano, while comfortable and stylish, is prone to CVT issues which can be very expensive. Other issues such as oil consumption and electrical problems are also reported. A pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended, focusing on the condition of the CVT, potential oil leaks, and the overall electrical system.
