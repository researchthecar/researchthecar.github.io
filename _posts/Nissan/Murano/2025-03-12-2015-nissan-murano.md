The 2015 Nissan Murano is a mid-size SUV known for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. All 2015 Murano models came equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 260 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Murano's smooth ride and fuel efficiency, but some dislike its polarizing design and the sometimes-unpredictable behavior of the CVT. Common complaints revolve around transmission issues, electrical problems, and interior accessory malfunctions.
