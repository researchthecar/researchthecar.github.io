### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Nissan Murano, while offering a unique driving experience, presents some common reliability concerns typical for its age and the early adoption of CVT technology. The most significant potential expense lies with the CVT transmission, which can be prone to overheating and failure if not properly maintained. Engine oil leaks and intake manifold gasket issues are also noted. Electrical components like the alternator and BCM can also be sources of trouble. Suspension wear and exterior paint issues are also areas to inspect. Regular maintenance, especially for the transmission fluid, is crucial for longevity. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in possible repair costs.
