### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Nissan Murano generally presents a good reliability record, especially concerning its powertrain. The 3.5L V6 engine is a proven unit, though minor oil and coolant leaks can occur with age. The CVT, while generally performing well, is the most frequently cited area for potential issues, with symptoms like hesitation or overheating requiring attention. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Suspension components like struts can wear over time, leading to a less comfortable ride. Interior issues are less common but can involve the climate control blower or power seat motors. Overall, the Murano is a solid choice, but owners should be aware of potential CVT and electrical system concerns.
