The 2007 Nissan Murano is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its distinctive styling and comfortable ride. All 2007 Muranos were equipped with a 3.5-liter VQ35DE V6 engine producing 245 horsepower and 237 lb-ft of torque. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) was the sole transmission option. Owners often praised the Murano for its smooth ride, responsive handling, and spacious interior. Common complaints included CVT transmission issues, excessive fuel consumption, and some electrical problems.

**Engine**

**3.5L VQ35DE V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to premature engine wear and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels, using a heavier weight oil, or engine rebuild/replacement depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially in colder weather. Can eventually lead to timing chain failure and significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of timing chain, tensioner, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Transmission Failure/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation upon acceleration, slipping between "gears", shuddering, erratic RPM fluctuations, and eventual complete transmission failure. Often accompanied by a "check engine" light and diagnostic codes related to transmission issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and replacement (may temporarily alleviate minor symptoms), or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 (fluid change), $3,500 - $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, jerking, or delayed engagement of gears. Can be intermittent and worsen over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front or rear suspension when driving over bumps. Worn strut mounts can also contribute to poor handling and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Subframe Rust/Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive rust and corrosion on the rear subframe. This can weaken the subframe and potentially lead to structural failure.
    *   Solution: Rust repair/prevention, or complete subframe replacement if damage is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Fuel Gauge Inaccuracy**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel gauge may read inaccurately, showing empty when the tank is not, or full when the tank is not.
    *   Solution: Fuel sending unit replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to lock or unlock with the remote or interior switch. This can affect one or more doors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (per door)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch struts lose their ability to hold the hatch open, causing it to fall down unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear hatch struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, make grinding noises when opening or closing, or fail to open/close completely.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+ depending on complexity
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Nissan Murano presents a mixed bag for potential owners. While it offers a comfortable and stylish driving experience, it is plagued by several potentially expensive issues, most notably with the CVT transmission. Engine oil consumption and timing chain problems can also lead to significant repair bills. Suspension and electrical issues are less severe but still warrant attention. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, with repair costs potentially exceeding several thousand dollars. Buyers should be diligent in inspecting the vehicle's service history, paying close attention to the transmission and engine. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
