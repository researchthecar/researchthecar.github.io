### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Nissan Murano, while offering a unique style and comfortable ride, presents several potential reliability concerns that owners should be aware of. The VQ35DE engine can be prone to oil and coolant leaks, requiring attention to prevent more serious damage. The CVT transmission is a notable area of concern, with reports of hesitation, shuddering, and overheating, often necessitating costly repairs or replacement.
