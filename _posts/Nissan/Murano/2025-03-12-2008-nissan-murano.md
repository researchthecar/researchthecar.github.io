**Summary:**

The 2008 Nissan Murano, while stylish and comfortable, is prone to some notable issues. The most significant concern revolves around the CVT transmission, which can suffer from slipping, shuddering, and eventual failure, leading to substantial repair costs. Engine issues such as oil consumption and timing chain problems can also be expensive to address. Electrical problems like battery drain and inaccurate fuel gauges, and other interior issues, while less critical, can still add to the overall cost of ownership. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle inspected, especially checking the transmission's health, before purchase.
