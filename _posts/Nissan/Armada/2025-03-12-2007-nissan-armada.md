The 2007 Nissan Armada is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and robust build. It was primarily offered with a 5.6-liter VK56DE V8 engine producing around 317 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Armada's powerful engine and ability to haul large loads. Some common dislikes include the large size making it difficult to park, and poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

**5.6L VK56DE V8**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. This can lead to poor engine performance and eventually engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioners, guides, and potentially the timing chain itself.
