**Introduction:**

The 2005 Nissan Armada is a full-size SUV powered by a standard 5.6L V8 engine paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and off-road capabilities, it has also experienced its fair share of problems.

**Engine**

**5.6L V8**

* **Intake manifold cracking:** Intake manifolds can crack, leading to vacuum leaks and reduced engine performance. Symptoms include rough idle, stalling, and decreased fuel economy. Repair involves replacing the intake manifold. Estimated cost: $500 - $1000+
* **Throttle position sensor failure:** The throttle position sensor can fail, causing the vehicle to stall or hesitate during acceleration. Replacement of the sensor is necessary. Estimated cost: $200 - $300+
* **Oxygen sensor failure:** Faulty oxygen sensors can affect air-fuel mixture and engine performance. Symptoms include illuminated check engine light, poor fuel economy, and rough running. Replacing the sensor is the solution. Estimated cost: $200 - $500+
* **Spark plug wire arcing:** The spark plug wires can arc, potentially causing engine misfires and decreased performance. Replacement of the spark plug wires is necessary. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+
* **Evaporative emission control system leak:** Leaks in the EVAP system can cause fuel vapor to escape, leading to increased emissions and check engine light illumination. Repair involves finding and sealing the leak. Estimated cost: $300 - $600+
* **Timing chain rattle:** In some cases, the timing chain can develop a rattle, especially at startup. Replacement of the timing chain and related components is required. Estimated cost: $1000 - $2000+

**Transmission**

**5-speed Automatic**

* **Slipping gears:** The transmission may slip out of gear, especially during acceleration or shifting. Repair involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Estimated cost: $2000 - $3000+
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing shuddering, slipping, or inability to move. Replacement of the torque converter is necessary. Estimated cost: $1000 - $2000+
* **Valve body failure:** The valve body, which regulates fluid flow within the transmission, can fail, leading to shifting problems and transmission damage. Replacement or rebuild of the valve body is the solution. Estimated cost: $500 - $1000+
* **Differential leak:** The differential may develop a leak, causing fluid loss and potential damage to the differential assembly. Repair involves replacing the differential seals. Estimated cost: $300 - $600+

**Suspension**

* **Strut mount failure:** The strut mounts, which connect the struts to the vehicle body, can fail prematurely, causing clunking noises and reduced handling. Replacement of the strut mounts is necessary. Estimated cost: $400 - $600+
* **Rear suspension bushing wear:** The bushings in the rear suspension can wear out, leading to increased NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) and poor handling. Replacement of the bushings is required. Estimated cost: $300 - $500+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, leading to charging system issues and potential battery drain. Replacement of the alternator is necessary. Estimated cost: $500 - $800+
* **Starter failure:** The starter motor can fail, preventing the engine from starting. Replacement of the starter is necessary. Estimated cost: $300 - $500+
* **Ignition switch failure:** The ignition switch can fail, causing the vehicle to stall or fail to start. Replacement of the ignition switch is necessary. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+

**Exterior**

* **Power liftgate failure:** The power liftgate mechanism can fail, preventing the liftgate from opening or closing properly. Repair involves replacing the liftgate motor, struts, or control module. Estimated cost: $400 - $800+
* **Headlight condensation:** The headlights can develop condensation inside, which can affect illumination and aesthetics. Repair involves resealing the headlights or replacing them. Estimated cost: $200 - $500+

**Interior**

* **HVAC blend door actuator failure:** The HVAC blend door actuator can fail, affecting the ability to control the temperature and airflow of the climate system. Replacement of the actuator is necessary. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+
* **Instrument cluster failure:** The instrument cluster, which displays vehicle information, can fail, leading to inaccurate readings or complete failure. Replacement of the instrument cluster is necessary. Estimated cost: $500 - $1000+
* **Power window failure:** The power window motors can fail, preventing the windows from operating properly. Replacement of the motors or switches is necessary. Estimated cost: $200 - $600+

**Summary:**

The 2005 Nissan Armada has experienced a range of issues, primarily affecting the engine, transmission, and electrical components. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to repair, others can be more severe and costly. Despite these problems, the Armada remains a popular choice for those seeking a spacious and capable SUV.
