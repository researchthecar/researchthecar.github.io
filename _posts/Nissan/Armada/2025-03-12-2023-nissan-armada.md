The 2023 Nissan Armada is a full-size SUV known for its robust capabilities, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. It comes standard with a 5.6-liter V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Armada's towing capacity and off-road capability, while others find its fuel economy lacking and its technology somewhat dated compared to newer competitors.

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported oil leaks, often originating from the valve cover gaskets or the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket is the typical solution. For valve cover gaskets, it involves removing the valve cover and installing a new gasket. For the oil pan gasket, the oil pan needs to be removed, cleaned, and a new gasket installed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on location of leak and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Knocking/Ticking Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a knocking or ticking noise, especially on cold starts. This could be related to the hydraulic lash adjusters (HLAs) or the timing chain.
    * Solution: Diagnosis is crucial. If it's HLA-related, replacement of the affected HLAs is the solution. If it's the timing chain, replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for valve lash adjusters or $1500 - $3000+ for timing chain repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or delayed shifting, particularly when shifting between gears at lower speeds. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop has also been reported.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update might resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid flush, $800 - $1500+ for valve body, or $3000 - $6000+ for transmission rebuild.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission will act as if it is shifting between gears erratically while already in gear, with an increase in RPMs but no corresponding increase in speed.
    * Solution: Replace the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+ for transmission replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some Armada models are equipped with a rear air suspension system. Issues can include sagging rear end, failure to maintain ride height, and compressor malfunctions.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the system is required to identify the faulty component, which could be the air springs, compressor, or height sensors. Replacement of the affected parts is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per air spring, $400 - $800+ for compressor, $100 - $300+ for height sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found
