The 2022 Nissan Armada is a full-size SUV offering a spacious interior and robust performance. All 2022 Armadas are equipped with a 5.6-liter V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Armada for its comfortable ride, powerful engine, and towing capacity. However, some common complaints include its relatively poor fuel economy and large size, which can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**5.6L V8**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine knocking or pinging, especially under load or during acceleration. This can be a sign of improper combustion or low-octane fuel usage.
    *   Solution: Try using higher-octane fuel as recommended by Nissan. If the problem persists, a dealer inspection may be required to check for issues with the engine management system, spark plugs, or other components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (diagnosis) - $500+ (if parts replacement is required)

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption. This requires more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is deemed excessive (more than 1 quart per 1,000 miles), a dealer inspection may be necessary to check for leaks, worn piston rings, or valve seals.

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during low-speed operation or when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: A software update for the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission flush or replacement of the valve body may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (software update), $200 - $400 (transmission flush), $800+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with the optional rear air suspension may experience issues such as sagging, uneven ride height, or failure of the air compressor.
    *   Solution: Inspect the air struts, air lines, and air compressor for leaks or damage. Replace faulty components as needed.

**Summary**
The 2022 Nissan Armada generally presents owners with issues surrounding the engine, transmission, and electrical components. While there are no significant widespread issues, some owners have reported experiencing engine knocking, harsh shifting, and infotainment system glitches.
