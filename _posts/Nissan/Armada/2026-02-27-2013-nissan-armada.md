### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Nissan Armada is a capable full-size SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of a few common issues. The 5.6L V8 engine can experience problems with intake manifold gaskets and VVT actuators, leading to leaks and noise. The 5-speed automatic transmission may develop harsh shifting or slipping issues. On the electrical side, the alternator and Body Control Module are known to fail, causing various system malfunctions. Suspension components, particularly front bushings, can wear out, leading to noise and handling degradation. Interior climate control blend doors and the infotainment system's navigation can also be sources of trouble. While not all Armadas will experience these problems, they represent the most frequently reported non-wear-and-tear issues for this model year.
