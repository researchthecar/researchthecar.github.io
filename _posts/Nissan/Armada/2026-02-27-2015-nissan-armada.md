### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Nissan Armada, powered by its 5.6L V8 engine and paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, demonstrates a generally solid reliability record. However, owners should be aware of potential issues primarily concerning the engine's intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines, which can lead to coolant or oil leaks. The transmission, while robust, has seen reports of harsh shifting and overheating, often addressable with fluid services or cooler upgrades, though more severe cases may require extensive repairs. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread, recurring technical faults, indicating good overall build quality in these areas.
