### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Nissan Armada, powered by its robust 5.6L V8 engine, offers a generally dependable experience. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines, which can lead to leaks and performance problems. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while capable, has been known to develop issues with harsh shifting or slipping, sometimes requiring significant repair. Suspension components, particularly front bushings, can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, often traced to the Body Control Module, can also manifest. Despite these potential concerns, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to reported issues, the 2009 Armada can remain a reliable large SUV.
