### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Nissan Armada is a capable full-size SUV, but like many vehicles of its age and class, it is not without its potential issues. The most commonly reported technical problems revolve around the powertrain, specifically the 5.6L V8 engine's intake manifold gaskets and timing chain, as well as the 5-speed automatic transmission's tendency for harsh shifting or slipping. Suspension components, particularly front ball joints, and electrical issues related to the Body Control Module and alternator are also areas to monitor. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, minor issues like rear hatch struts and HVAC blower resistors can occur. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these known problem areas can help mitigate costly repairs and ensure the continued reliability of the 2005 Armada.
