Owners generally appreciate its comfortable ride and ample passenger and cargo space, but some common complaints include poor fuel economy and issues related to age and component wear.

**Engine**

**5.6L VK56DE V8**

*   **Timing Chain Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, particularly on start-up, indicating a worn or stretched timing chain. This can lead to poor engine performance and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leak sound, reduced fuel economy, and potential check engine light illumination. Often occurs due to thermal stress and age.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifold with an OEM or aftermarket alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, stalling, and a check engine light with codes related to the camshaft position sensor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable slippage between gears, rough or delayed shifting, and potential "clunking" sounds. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change, valve body repair or replacement, or complete transmission rebuild or replacement depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, along with potential transmission slipping or stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, the air compressor running constantly or not at all, a ride that is bumpy, and/or a warning light illuminated on the dashboard. This can be caused by leaks in the air springs, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning height sensor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air springs, air compressor, and/or height sensor. Converting to coil springs is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the component and if converting to coil springs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps, along with potential wandering or instability during driving.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn lower control arm bushings or the entire lower control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **IPDM (Intelligent Power Distribution Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical issues, including the vehicle not starting, headlights not working, or other seemingly random electrical malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty IPDM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Gauge Inaccuracy**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel gauge reading inaccurately, either showing empty when there is fuel in the tank or vice versa.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel level sending unit in the fuel tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Rust removal, panel replacement, and rust prevention treatments.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on severity and location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**

**Summary**
The 2009 Nissan Armada has some common issues, especially given its age. Engine and transmission issues can be costly, and electrical gremlins stemming from the IPDM can be frustrating. Suspension problems, particularly with the rear air suspension, can affect ride quality and also incur significant repair costs. Early detection and proactive maintenance are key to mitigating potential problems. Overall, while the Armada offers a lot of utility, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in potential repair costs.
