The 2008 Nissan Platina is a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets. Itâ€™s essentially a rebadged Renault Symbol/Thalia and shares many components with the Renault Clio. The Platina was offered with a 1.6-liter 16-valve gasoline engine producing around 110 horsepower and 109 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Platina for its fuel efficiency and affordability, but dislike its basic features, limited interior space, and somewhat unrefined driving experience.

**Engine**

**1.6L 16V Gasoline Engine**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes, often requiring frequent top-offs. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be visible, especially during acceleration.
    * Solution: A possible solution is to replace the piston rings and valve stem seals. In severe cases, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coil Pack Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to misfires are present.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**
* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed gear changes, transmission slipping during acceleration, and difficulty shifting into certain gears.
    * Solution: Could be caused by worn transmission fluid, a faulty valve body, or damaged internal components. Start by flushing and replacing the transmission fluid. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $2,500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and reduced handling stability. The vehicle may bottom out easily over bumps.
    * Solution: Replace the worn shock absorbers and/or struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Damaged Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Reduced handling precision.
    * Solution: Replace the worn or damaged suspension bushings.

**Summary**

The 2008 Nissan Platina, while economical, appears to have common issues related to its engine (oil consumption, coil pack failure), transmission (harsh shifting), suspension, and electrical systems. The severity ranges from minor inconveniences like faulty window switches to more serious problems like engine oil consumption that can lead to expensive repairs. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential maintenance costs when considering this vehicle.
