The 2002 Nissan Platina is a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets. It was essentially a rebadged Renault Clio II, built under a partnership between Nissan and Renault. The Platina was powered by a 1.6-liter inline-four gasoline engine producing around 110 horsepower and 109 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Platina for its fuel efficiency and relatively spacious interior for its class. Common complaints included concerns about its build quality, limited safety features (by modern standards), and availability of parts in some regions outside of its primary market.
