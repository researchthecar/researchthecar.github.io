The 2005 Nissan Platina, also known as the Renault Scala in some markets, was a rebadged Renault Thalia/Symbol, a small sedan aimed at providing affordable transportation. It came with a 1.6-liter gasoline engine. This engine produced around 95 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the Platina's fuel efficiency and compact size for city driving. Common complaints revolve around its relatively basic features, somewhat lackluster performance, and concerns about the availability of specific parts due to its Renault origins.
