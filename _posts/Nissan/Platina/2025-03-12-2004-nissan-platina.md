The 2004 Nissan Platina is a subcompact car, also known as the Renault Clio in some markets, rebadged for the Mexican market. It was offered with a 1.6-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 110 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. The Platina came with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
