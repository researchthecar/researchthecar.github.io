The 2010 Nissan Platina, also known as the Nissan Aprio in some markets, was a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries. It was based on the Renault Logan. The Platina came with a 1.6-liter inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 108 horsepower and 109 lb-ft of torque. The engine was offered with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Platina for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior for its class. Common complaints revolved around its basic features, somewhat unrefined driving experience, and limited availability of parts in some regions.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported higher than normal oil consumption between oil changes, potentially indicating worn piston rings or valve seals. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves a compression test and leak-down test to assess the condition of the piston rings and valves. Repair options range from replacing valve stem seals to a complete engine rebuild, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic idle, stalling, or difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the idle air control valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hard or jerky shifts between gears, particularly noticeable during acceleration or deceleration. This can indicate issues with the valve body or worn clutch packs within the transmission.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might provide a temporary fix. If the problem persists, a valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $2500+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. This often indicates worn-out bushings in the control arms, sway bar links, or struts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings or the entire component if the bushing is not replaceable separately.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per corner
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, poor fuel economy, and rough running. Various sensors, such as the oxygen sensor or crankshaft position sensor, can fail and cause these issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with an OBD-II scanner to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exterior door handles are prone to breaking, especially in colder climates, due to their plastic construction.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the broken door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per handle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor stops working, resulting in no air blowing from the vents. This can be due to a faulty blower motor or a failing blower motor resistor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor or the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Nissan Platina generally faces issues typical of a budget-friendly subcompact car. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption, can be costly, while suspension and electrical problems are relatively common and less expensive to address. The door handle and HVAC issues are annoyances that can add up over time. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into the cost of ownership. Severity of issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more significant mechanical repairs.
