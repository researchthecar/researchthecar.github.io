**Introduction:**

The 2006 Nissan Platina is a compact sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. It is available with a choice of two engines: a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with 107 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 140 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

Owners praise the Platina for its affordability, reliability, and spacious interior. However, some have reported issues with the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical system.
