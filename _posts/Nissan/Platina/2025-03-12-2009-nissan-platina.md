The 2009 Nissan Platina, primarily sold in Mexico and South America, is a rebadged Renault Symbol/Thalia. It was offered with a 1.6L K4M gasoline engine, producing around 110 horsepower and 109 lb-ft of torque. It's known for its affordability and fuel efficiency, making it a popular choice for budget-conscious buyers. However, it often faces criticism for its basic features, relatively unrefined interior, and handling characteristics. The 2009 Nissan Platina was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
