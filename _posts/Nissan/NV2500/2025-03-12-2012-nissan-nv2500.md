The 2012 Nissan NV2500 is a full-size cargo van known for its durability and spacious interior. It was offered with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.6L V8 producing 317 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the NV2500's payload capacity and reliability. However, some common complaints include issues related to its fuel economy and some electrical quirks.

**Summary**

The 2012 Nissan NV2500 can be a reliable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as timing chain concerns on the V6, exhaust manifold cracks on the V8, and potential torque converter problems with the transmission. Suspension issues, particularly rear leaf spring sagging, are also something to watch out for. Electrical issues, especially with the sliding door and blower motor, can occur. The severity of these issues varies, and repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor electrical fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. Being aware of these potential problems can help buyers make an informed decision and budget accordingly for potential repairs.
