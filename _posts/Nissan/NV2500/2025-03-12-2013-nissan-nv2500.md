The 2013 Nissan NV2500 is a full-size cargo van known for its robust build and practical design. It's a popular choice for businesses needing a reliable workhorse. It offers two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.6L V8 generating 317 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque. Drivers often appreciate the NV2500's spacious cargo area and comfortable front seating. However, some common complaints revolve around its fuel economy, relatively basic interior features, and the turning radius.
