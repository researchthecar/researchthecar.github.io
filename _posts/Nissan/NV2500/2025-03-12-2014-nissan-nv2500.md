The 2014 Nissan NV2500 is a full-size cargo van known for its reliability, spacious interior, and commercial-focused design. Engine options for the 2014 NV2500 include a 4.0L V6 producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.6L V8 producing 317 horsepower and 385 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the NV2500's comfortable seating, ample cargo space, and overall durability. Common dislikes include its fuel economy and somewhat utilitarian interior compared to more modern vans.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**
* **Timing Chain Rattle**
    * Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, especially on cold starts, indicates potential wear or stretching of the timing chain. This can lead to poor engine performance and, if left unaddressed, engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners is the common fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.6L V8**
* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be caused by worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    * Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution can range from using a higher viscosity oil and monitoring consumption to replacing piston rings or valve stem seals. A complete engine rebuild may be necessary in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**
* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifting between gears, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. This can be caused by worn valve body components or low transmission fluid.
    * Solution: Start by checking and replacing the transmission fluid. If the issue persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs sagging, especially under heavy loads, causing a noticeable decrease in ride height and potential bottoming out.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with new or upgraded heavy-duty springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sliding Door Sensor Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sliding door may not open or close properly, or the power-assist function may not work due to a faulty sensor.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the specific sensor and replacing it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Cable Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cable can fray and break. The sliding door becomes difficult to open and close.
    * Solution: Replacing the sliding door cable.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking and splitting of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard. Can also use a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2014 Nissan NV2500 is generally a reliable work van, but it does have some common issues. Engine problems, especially timing chain rattle in the V6 and oil consumption in the V8, can be costly to repair. The transmission can suffer from harsh shifting. Suspension issues like sagging leaf springs are common. Electrical issues with sliding doors and interior problems such as dashboard cracking can also occur. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
