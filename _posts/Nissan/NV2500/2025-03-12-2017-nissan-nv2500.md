The 2017 Nissan NV2500 is a full-size cargo van known for its reliability and spacious interior. Engine options include a 4.0L V6 producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.6L V8 producing 375 horsepower and 387 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the van's comfortable seating and ample cargo space, but some dislike the somewhat dated interior and fuel economy.
