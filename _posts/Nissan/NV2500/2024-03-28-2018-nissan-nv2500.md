**Introduction:**

The 2018 Nissan NV2500 is a full-size cargo van offered with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 and a 5.6L V8. Transmission options include a 5-speed automatic and a 7-speed automatic. The NV2500 offers a spacious cargo area, powerful engine options, and modern convenience features. However, it has its fair share of issues that owners have reported.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption:** Some 4.0L V6 engines experience excessive oil consumption, causing low oil levels and potential engine damage. Symptoms include low oil pressure warnings and burnt oil smell.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail prematurely, leading to timing chain skipping or breakage. Symptoms include engine noise, rough idling, and reduced engine power.

**5.6L V8**

* **Spark Plug Thread Stripping:** Some 5.6L V8 engines have reported spark plug thread stripping during removal. This can prevent the spark plug from being properly tightened, leading to ignition problems.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift Hesitation and Harsh Shifting:** Some 5-speed automatic transmissions experience shift hesitation, delayed shifts, and harsh engagements. This can be caused by worn clutches or faulty solenoid packs.

**7-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift Flare:** Some 7-speed automatic transmissions exhibit shift flare, which is a brief delay before the transmission engages a gear after upshifting or downshifting. This can be caused by worn clutch material or valve body issues.

**Suspension**

* **Rear Leaf Spring Damage:** Some NV2500s have reported rear leaf spring damage, leading to sagging or broken springs. Symptoms include uneven suspension height, reduced load capacity, and poor handling.
* **Shock Absorber Failure:** The shock absorbers on some NV2500s can prematurely fail, causing poor ride quality, excessive body roll, and reduced braking effectiveness.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Some NV2500s have experienced battery drain issues, leading to a dead battery. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including a parasitic electrical draw or a faulty alternator.
* **Electrical System Failure:** Some NV2500s have reported electrical system failures, including issues with lighting, power windows, and door locks. This can be caused by faulty wiring or a defective electrical module.

**Exterior**

* **Rear Bumper Damage:** Some NV2500s have reported damage to the rear bumper, including cracking or breaking. This can be caused by impact damage or poor construction.
* **Rust Issues:** Some NV2500s have exhibited premature rust and corrosion, particularly on the undercarriage and body panels.

**Interior**

* **Center Console Defect:** Some NV2500s have reported a defective center console that can detach or break during use.
* **Door Panel Damage:** Some NV2500s have experienced damage to the door panels, including loose handles or broken upholstery.
* **HVAC Malfunction:** Some NV2500s have reported HVAC system malfunctions, including issues with air conditioning, heating, or ventilation.

**Summary:**

The 2018 Nissan NV2500 has received mixed reviews from owners. While it offers a spacious cargo area and powerful engine options, it has also been plagued by numerous issues, including excessive oil consumption, spark plug thread stripping, shift hesitation, and rear leaf spring damage. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but they can be significant for some owners.
