### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Nissan Pathfinder Armada, powered by the robust 5.6L V8 engine, generally offers good reliability. However, common issues to be aware of include potential leaks from the intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines, as well as transmission problems like harsh shifting or slipping, particularly with higher mileage. Suspension components, especially bushings, can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module, and premature alternator failure are also noted concerns. While the exterior and interior have fewer widespread technical issues, attention to climate control actuators is advisable. Proactive maintenance and addressing these specific potential problems can significantly enhance the long-term reliability of this capable SUV.
