The 2017 Nissan Kicks was not released until 2018. So there are no 2017 Nissan Kicks vehicles. I will provide the data for the 2018 Nissan Kicks instead.

The 2018 Nissan Kicks is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and distinctive styling. It comes standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 125 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate its spacious interior for its class, user-friendly technology, and nimble handling. However, some common complaints include the lack of all-wheel drive and limited engine power, which can feel strained during highway driving or when fully loaded.
