The 2018 Nissan Kicks is a subcompact SUV powered by a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing 125 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque. It is exclusively paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and front-wheel drive. People generally like the Kicks for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and spacious cargo area for its class. Common complaints include its underpowered engine, noisy CVT, and basic interior.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil frequently between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be observed.
    *   Solution: A compression and leak-down test can help determine the source of the oil consumption. If the piston rings are the cause, engine repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Knocking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners may experience engine knocking or pinging, especially during acceleration or under load. This can be caused by low-octane fuel, carbon buildup, or a faulty knock sensor.
    *   Solution: Using higher-octane fuel, cleaning the fuel injectors and intake valves, or replacing the knock sensor may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Juddering/Shaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing juddering, shaking, or hesitation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can be caused by wear or damage to the CVT belt or pulleys, or by contaminated or degraded transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid flush and replacement with genuine Nissan NS-3 CVT fluid may resolve the issue. In severe cases, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete failure of the CVT can occur, resulting in the vehicle being unable to accelerate or move. This can be caused by internal damage to the transmission components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT is typically the only solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the struts and shock absorbers wear out prematurely, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll in corners, and unusual noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and/or shock absorbers is the recommended fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera can occur, displaying a black screen or distorted image. This can be caused by a faulty camera unit, wiring issues, or a software glitch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the backup camera, repairing the wiring harness, or updating the vehicle's software may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with Bluetooth connectivity can arise, including difficulty pairing devices, dropped connections, or poor audio quality.
    *   Solution: Updating the infotainment system software, resetting the Bluetooth module, or replacing the Bluetooth module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $300+ (software updates may be free)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Paint Quality Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the paint is thin and easily scratched or chipped.
    *   Solution: Applying a protective coating (e.g., ceramic coating or paint protection film) can help prevent further damage. Repainting the affected areas is another option, though it can be costly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive, requiring a restart to resolve the issue.
    *   Solution: Updating the infotainment system software or replacing the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $800+ (software updates may be free)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2018 Nissan Kicks has a few notable issues. Engine problems, such as excessive oil consumption, are severe and can be costly to fix. CVT issues, including juddering and potential failure, are also concerning and can be expensive. Other issues, such as suspension wear, electrical glitches, and paint quality problems, are less severe but can still be a nuisance. The average cost to repair most of these issues is around $3,000 on the high end but most issues should be less.
