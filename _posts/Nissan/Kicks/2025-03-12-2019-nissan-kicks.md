**Summary:**

The 2019 Nissan Kicks, while generally reliable, has some common issues. The most concerning are related to the CVT transmission, which can experience juddering, whining, and hesitation, potentially leading to costly replacement. Engine issues such as misfires and catalytic converter failures can also arise. The suspension may require attention due to premature wear of struts/shocks, and electrical glitches with the backup camera and infotainment system can be frustrating. Rust on the hood and dashboard cracking are also common. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes, others, like transmission replacement, can be quite expensive. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used Kicks, paying particular attention to the transmission's performance.
