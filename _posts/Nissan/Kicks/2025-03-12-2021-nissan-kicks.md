The 2021 Nissan Kicks is a subcompact SUV known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and spacious cargo area despite its small footprint. It's powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 122 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise its nimble handling, user-friendly technology, and distinctive styling. Criticisms often include its modest power output, which can make it feel sluggish during acceleration and passing maneuvers, and some reports of CVT issues.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. This may be indicated by the low oil pressure light illuminating or noticing a significant drop in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: The solution varies based on the severity. Initially, dealerships may monitor oil consumption over a set mileage. In severe cases, engine repairs or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating are possible symptoms of engine misfires. The cause of this may stem from issues with the ignition coils or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the misfire with an OBD-II scanner and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Hesitation and Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported hesitation during acceleration, particularly from a stop or at low speeds. Jerking or shuddering during gear changes (simulated shifts in the CVT) is also reported.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer may resolve the issue in some cases. In more severe cases, CVT replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 for software update. $3,000 - $5,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete failure of the CVT, rendering the vehicle undriveable. This may be preceded by loud noises, slipping, or inability to accelerate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
