The 2022 Nissan Kicks is a subcompact SUV known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and surprisingly spacious interior. It comes standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 122 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). People generally appreciate the Kicks for its value, user-friendly technology, and nimble handling in city driving. However, some criticisms include the lack of all-wheel drive, modest engine power, and the drone of the CVT under heavy acceleration.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**

*   **Engine Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. This can be indicated by the low oil pressure light illuminating on the dashboard or engine knocking sounds.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and addressing any leaks. If oil consumption is excessive, a mechanic should perform a leak-down test or compression test to identify the source of the problem, which could range from faulty valve stem seals to worn piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$2000+ depending on the cause and repair required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jutter or Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a jutter or shuddering sensation, especially during low-speed acceleration or when the transmission is under load. This can manifest as vibrations or a hesitant feeling during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Perform a CVT fluid change with genuine Nissan CVT fluid. If the issue persists, the CVT may require inspection or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid change; $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Inaccurate Fuel Gauge**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel gauge may display an incorrect reading, either showing more fuel than actually present or dropping to empty prematurely. This can lead to concerns about running out of fuel unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: The fuel level sensor or fuel pump assembly may need to be replaced, the fuel tank may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Connectivity Problems with NissanConnect**
    * Description/Symptoms: Users have reported issues with the NissanConnect infotainment system, including Bluetooth pairing failures, unresponsive touchscreen, and error messages.
    * Solution: Try a system reset or software update. If the problems persist, a dealer visit might be needed to diagnose and potentially replace the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $500 - $1500+ (head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Daytime Running Lights (DRL) Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DRLs may intermittently fail to illuminate or flicker. This can be a safety concern, as the DRLs are designed to improve visibility to other drivers.
    *   Solution: Check the DRL bulb or LED module. If the bulb is good, the wiring or DRL control module may be faulty and require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling or Squeaking Noises from Dashboard or Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported various rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the noise and apply felt tape or other sound-dampening material to the affected areas. In some cases, trim pieces may need to be re-secured or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ depending on the severity and source of the noise.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Nissan Kicks generally presents with minor to moderate issues. The most significant concern is the potential for CVT issues, which can be costly to repair. Owners should also be aware of potential electrical problems and interior noise complaints. Addressing oil consumption early can prevent more extensive engine damage. Overall, regular maintenance and prompt attention to any unusual symptoms can help ensure the longevity and reliability of the vehicle.
