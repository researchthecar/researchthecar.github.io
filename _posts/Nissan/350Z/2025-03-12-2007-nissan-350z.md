The 2007 Nissan 350Z is a sporty two-door coupe and roadster, known for its rear-wheel-drive layout and responsive handling. It was available with only one engine option: the 3.5-liter VQ35HR V6 engine, producing 306 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Enthusiasts appreciate the 350Z for its performance, aggressive styling, and relatively affordable price point. Some common criticisms include a somewhat harsh ride, road noise, and interior materials that aren't considered premium.
