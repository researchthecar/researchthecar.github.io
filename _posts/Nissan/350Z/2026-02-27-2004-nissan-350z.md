### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Nissan 350Z offers a compelling sports car experience with generally good mechanical reliability. The VQ35DE engine, while powerful, can be prone to oil consumption and VVT issues, requiring diligent maintenance. Manual transmissions are robust but can develop synchronizer wear over time, while automatics may experience shifting problems. Suspension components, particularly bushings, are common wear items that can affect handling and alignment. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM issues, and exterior paint degradation are also noted concerns. Despite these potential issues, with proper maintenance and addressing known problems, the 2004 350Z remains a desirable and enjoyable sports car.
