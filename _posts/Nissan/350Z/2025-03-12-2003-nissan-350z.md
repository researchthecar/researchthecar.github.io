The 2003 Nissan 350Z is a two-door sports car that marked Nissan's return to the Z car lineage. It was offered with only one engine option, the VQ35DE 3.5-liter V6, producing 287 horsepower and 274 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. The 350Z is generally praised for its sporty handling, attractive styling, and relatively affordable price point. Criticisms often include a somewhat rough ride, limited interior space, and some common reliability issues.

**Engine**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2003 350Zs, especially those driven hard, can exhibit excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between changes, blue smoke from the exhaust (especially on startup or acceleration), and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Addressing oil consumption can range from using a heavier weight oil to replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (heavier oil) - $5000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft position sensors can fail, leading to rough running, stalling, a check engine light, and potential difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty camshaft position sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to camshaft position sensors, the crankshaft position sensor can also fail, resulting in stalling, difficulty starting, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Grinding/Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, often accompanied by a grinding noise. This can be due to worn synchronizers.
    *   Solution: Replacing the synchronizers or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slippage/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic transmission can experience slippage between gears or harsh/jerky shifts, especially as the car ages or with high mileage.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might temporarily improve the issue. However, if the problem persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The suspension bushings (especially in the control arms and sway bar links) can wear out over time, leading to clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on which bushings and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**

**Summary**

The 2003 Nissan 350Z, while a fun and stylish sports car, has some common issues to watch out for. Engine issues like oil consumption and sensor failures are relatively common and can range from inexpensive fixes to more costly repairs. Transmission problems, particularly with the manual transmission, can also be expensive. Suspension bushing wear is typical for a car of this age. The electrical and interior issues are generally less severe and cheaper to fix. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have a pre-purchase inspection performed to assess the vehicle's condition.
