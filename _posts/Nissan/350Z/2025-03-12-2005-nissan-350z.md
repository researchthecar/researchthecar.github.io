The 2005 Nissan 350Z is a popular sports car known for its performance and sleek design. It came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine, known as the VQ35DE, that produced 287 horsepower and 274 lb-ft of torque. The vehicle had two transmission options which were a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally praise the 350Z for its handling, power, and overall driving experience. However, some common complaints include interior plastic quality, road noise, and a somewhat stiff ride.

**Engine**

**VQ35DE**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2005 350Z owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between changes. Symptoms can include blue exhaust smoke and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, solutions range from replacing PCV valve and monitoring, to more extensive engine work like piston ring replacement or a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft position sensor can fail, leading to rough running, stalling, or a no-start condition. The check engine light will illuminate, and a diagnostic scan will reveal relevant trouble codes (P0340, P0345 etc.).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the camshaft position sensor, a failing crankshaft position sensor can cause stalling, difficulty starting, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Slave Cylinder Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch pedal sticking to the floor, difficulty shifting, and/or a soft or spongy clutch feel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch slave cylinder, and sometimes the master cylinder as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delays in shifting, slipping between gears, or harsh/jerky shifts. These symptoms may be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: Fluid flush or complete transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200- $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision and increased tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and/or oil leaking from the strut/shock.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty strut/shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery is dead, vehicle cannot be started after sitting for some time.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the drain by testing the amperage coming from each fuse while the car is off and the key is not in the ignition. Replace the faulty component once the circuit that is causing the drain is discovered.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Bose Stereo Amplifier Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory Bose amplifier can fail, resulting in no sound from the speakers, distorted sound, or intermittent sound issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the Bose amplifier. Some owners opt to replace the entire system with aftermarket components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic door handles can break, particularly in colder climates, making it difficult or impossible to open the door from the outside.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the broken door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2005 Nissan 350Z, while a fun and sporty vehicle, has a few common issues to be aware of. Engine issues such as oil consumption and sensor failures can lead to moderate repair costs. Transmission problems, particularly with the clutch slave cylinder (manual) and slipping (automatic), can also be a concern. Suspension wear and electrical issues like battery drains and amplifier failures are also present in some vehicles. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on the severity.
