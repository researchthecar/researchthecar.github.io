# 2010 Nissan Rogue

### Overview
The 2010 Nissan Rogue is a compact SUV that offered a decent balance of fuel efficiency and practicality for its class. It primarily came equipped with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While generally considered a reliable vehicle for its age, like any car, it has specific areas that have seen more frequent reports of issues. Owners often praise its maneuverability and comfortable ride for daily commuting. However, potential buyers should be aware of common concerns, particularly related to the CVT and certain electrical components, which can impact long-term ownership costs. Regular maintenance is key to mitigating many of these potential problems.

### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Nissan Rogue is a generally dependable compact SUV, but its primary powertrain components, the 2.5L engine and especially the CVT transmission, are known to be potential weak points. Owners should be vigilant about oil levels and be prepared for potential CVT issues like hesitation or overheating, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM, can also arise. While the suspension, exterior, and interior are typically robust, addressing engine and transmission concerns proactively through diligent maintenance and early detection of symptoms will be crucial for long-term reliability and ownership satisfaction.
