## Engine

### 2.5L QR25DE (4-Cylinder)
**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage if not monitored.
- **Solution:** Engine rebuild or replacement, piston ring replacement.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $4,000

**CVT Fluid Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Leaking transmission fluid, often from seals or cooler lines, leading to transmission performance issues.
- **Solution:** Replacement of leaking seals or lines, CVT fluid flush and refill.
- **Cost:** $300 - $800


## Transmission

### CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)
**Overheating and Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Hesitation, slipping, shuddering, or complete failure of the transmission, often exacerbated by towing or heavy use.
- **Solution:** CVT fluid flush and filter replacement, transmission repair or replacement.
- **Cost:** $2,500 - $5,000


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Strut Mount Bearing Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking or popping noises when turning the steering wheel, especially at low speeds.
- **Solution:** Replacement of strut mount bearings.
- **Cost:** $200 - $500


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Malfunctions**
- **Symptoms:** Issues with power windows, door locks, interior lights, or dashboard warning lights not functioning correctly.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1,200


### Keyless Entry/Start System
**Failure to Start**
- **Symptoms:** Vehicle may not start or may crank but not turn over, often related to the intelligent key system or ignition switch.

### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Nissan Rogue, while offering a practical package, is known to have some specific reliability concerns, most notably with its CVT transmission and potential for oil consumption in the 2.5L engine. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and keyless entry system, can also be a source of frustration and expense. Exterior paint issues and interior HVAC problems are less common but still reported. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the possibility of repairs, especially concerning the transmission, which can be a significant cost. Regular maintenance, particularly of the CVT fluid, is crucial for longevity.
