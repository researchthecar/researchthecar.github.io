The 2015 Nissan Rogue is a popular compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable ride. It's powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While owners appreciate its spacious interior and good gas mileage, some common complaints include issues with the CVT transmission, electrical problems, and interior accessories.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address any leaks. A potential fix could involve replacing piston rings or addressing valve stem seal issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibrations, especially during acceleration and idle, can indicate worn or broken engine mounts.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed engine mount(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Transmission Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, jerking, slipping, whining noises, or complete transmission failure. Many owners have reported premature CVT failure, some as early as 60,000 miles.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT transmission is often the only solution. Some owners have had success with valve body replacements, but this is not always a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+ (CVT replacement), $800 - $2000 (Valve Body Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Juddering/Shaking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shaking or juddering sensation, particularly during low-speed acceleration.
    *   Solution: A software update for the transmission control module (TCM) or CVT fluid change may alleviate the issue temporarily. Replacing the transmission is the ultimate fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Fluid Change), $300 - $500 (Software Update), $3000 - $5000+ (CVT Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and poor handling. Often related to worn struts, strut mounts, or sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension components, such as struts, strut mounts, sway bar links, and control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, or the car fails to start at all after being parked for a short period.
    *   Solution: Investigate parasitic drain issues, which can be caused by faulty modules or accessories. A parasitic draw test can identify the source of the drain. Replacing the battery may be a temporary fix if the battery is old or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (Battery Replacement), $100 - $500+ (Parasitic Drain Diagnosis and Repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blind Spot Monitoring System Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blind Spot Monitoring System inoperative or gives false warning messages.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the system to find the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The liftgate does not stay open on its own and falls down.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the struts
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air coming from the air conditioning vents. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Recharge the refrigerant, repair any leaks, replace the compressor, or replace the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Navigation/Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system freezes, reboots unexpectedly, or the touchscreen becomes unresponsive. The infotainment system may also experience glitches or connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. More severe problems may require replacing the entire head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+ (depending on the issue and solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found
