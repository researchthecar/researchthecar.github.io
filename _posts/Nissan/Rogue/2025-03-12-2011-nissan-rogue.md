The 2011 Nissan Rogue is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable ride. It came equipped with a 2.5L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Rogue's spacious interior and smooth ride, but some common complaints include issues with the CVT transmission, particularly related to reliability and longevity, and some concerns about engine noise and premature wear of certain components.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 (QR25DE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes an excessive amount of oil between oil changes, often noticed by having to add oil frequently. Can lead to engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings and valve seals can mitigate the issue. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. Can lead to engine misfires and eventually engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency. Can cause reduced engine performance and fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission may exhibit slipping, jerking, or hesitation during acceleration. This can be more pronounced at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change can temporarily alleviate the symptoms. However, often the CVT needs to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **"Whining" Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining noise coming from the transmission, especially during acceleration or deceleration. This noise can indicate internal wear.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replacement of the CVT transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Often caused by worn sway bar links or bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn sway bar links, bushings, and potentially other suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Interior Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Multiple interior lights such as dome lights, map lights, or lights in the dash all stop working.
    *   Solution: Replacing the bulbs is a potential fix. If the bulbs are good and the lights still don't work, then the BCM needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $150+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage and Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the undercarriage, especially in areas exposed to road salt. Rust can also appear on body panels, particularly around wheel wells and seams.
    *   Solution: Rust removal, treatment, and repainting. Application of rust inhibitors to prevent future corrosion. In severe cases, panel replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air coming from the air conditioning system. Can be caused by a refrigerant leak, faulty compressor, or other A/C system components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the A/C system, including refrigerant recharge, leak repair, compressor replacement, or replacement of other faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Nissan Rogue has several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the CVT transmission, which can suffer from slippage, jerking, and premature failure, potentially leading to costly repairs. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and timing chain problems can also be expensive to address. Suspension noises and electrical problems can also arise, adding to the overall cost of ownership. While the Rogue offers a comfortable and fuel-efficient ride, these potential issues should be carefully considered before purchasing. The severity of the issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing several thousand dollars.
