**2016 Nissan Rogue**

The 2016 Nissan Rogue is a compact SUV that seats up to five passengers. It is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

The Rogue is available in four trim levels: S, SV, SL, and SV Hybrid. The S trim comes standard with features such as 17-inch steel wheels, a rearview camera, and a four-speaker sound system. The SV trim adds features such as 18-inch alloy wheels, a power driver's seat, and a six-speaker sound system. The SL trim adds features such as leather seats, a sunroof, and a navigation system. The SV Hybrid trim comes with the same features as the SV trim, but it also has a hybrid powertrain that improves fuel economy.

The Rogue has received positive reviews for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and good fuel economy. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of power and its CVT transmission.
