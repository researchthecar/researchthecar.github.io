The 2010 Nissan Rogue is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and practicality. It was only offered with a single engine option, the 2.5-liter QR25DE inline-4, producing around 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Rogue's comfortable ride and cargo space, but common complaints include concerns about CVT reliability and some interior trim quality.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil more often than expected, blueish smoke from the exhaust, and potential low oil level warning lights.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings may reduce oil consumption. In more severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature catalytic converter failure can occur. Symptoms include a check engine light (typically with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency), reduced engine performance, and a sulfur smell from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT can experience failures, often manifested as slipping, jerking, hesitation during acceleration, or complete transmission failure. Whining noises from the transmission are also a common symptom.
    *   Solution: In many cases, the CVT needs to be replaced or rebuilt. Fluid changes can sometimes help mitigate minor issues, but complete failure usually necessitates replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure causes shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Transmission may also get stuck in gear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, it could cause damage to the transmission requiring a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.

**Summary**

The 2010 Nissan Rogue, while generally a practical vehicle, has some notable problem areas. The most significant and costly issues revolve around the CVT, with failures being a major concern. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and catalytic converter failure can also be expensive to address. Suspension and electrical problems are generally less severe but can still be annoying. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in the possibility of needing costly repairs, particularly related to the CVT.
