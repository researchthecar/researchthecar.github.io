The 2021 Nissan Rogue represents the beginning of the Rogue's third generation and is generally well-received. It comes standard with a 2.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 181 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). For the 2022+ model years, a 1.5L turbocharged 3-cylinder engine was offered in addition to the 2.5L. Owners often praise the Rogue's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and updated technology features. However, some common complaints include concerns about the CVT's reliability and the engine's performance, especially when fully loaded.

**Summary:**

The 2021 Nissan Rogue is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some notable issues. The most concerning are potential CVT problems and engine oil consumption, which can be costly to repair.

While not all vehicles will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues. Addressing minor issues early can prevent more serious and expensive problems later.
