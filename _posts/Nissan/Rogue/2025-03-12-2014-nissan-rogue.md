The 2014 Nissan Rogue is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable ride. It offers a single engine option: a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate the Rogue's spacious interior and good gas mileage, but some dislike its uninspiring handling and potential CVT issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between changes. This can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels frequently. If consumption is high, a mechanic can perform a leak-down test to identify the source. Depending on the cause, repairs can range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, or even a full engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine light illuminating, decreased engine performance, rattling noise coming from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed Catalytic Converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Transmission Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation, slipping, jerking, or complete failure of the CVT. Often accompanied by a whining noise. Can lead to the vehicle being undriveable.
    *   Solution: Requires a transmission replacement or rebuild in most cases. Fluid changes and software updates might provide temporary relief but are unlikely to resolve the underlying issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Juddering/Shaking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle shakes or judders during acceleration, especially at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: CVT Fluid change may temporarily resolve the issue. In most cases, complete transmission replacement or rebuild is the only lasting solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change), $3,000 - $5,000+ (replacement/rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, uneven tire wear, leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Often related to worn bushings or sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn bushings, sway bar links, or other suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not driven frequently. Can lead to difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws by testing each fuse with an ammeter, a common culprit is aftermarket accessories, or a failing BCM (Body Control Module). Replace the battery if it is old or faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, poor acceleration, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Hatch/Liftgate**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming around the license plate light area, and along the bottom edge of the liftgate.
    *   Solution: Removal of rust and repainting the affected area. In severe cases, the entire liftgate may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+

    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing devices, frequent disconnects, poor audio quality during calls.
    *   Solution: Try updating the infotainment system software. If the problem persists, the Bluetooth module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $400+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan Rogue presents a mixed bag for potential owners. While it offers good fuel economy and a comfortable ride, the most significant concern is the potential for costly CVT issues. The transmission problems are fairly widespread and, when they occur, lead to significant repair bills. Oil consumption and other issues also add to the potential ownership costs. Carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic, particularly focusing on the transmission health, before buying.
