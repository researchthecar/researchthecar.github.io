## Engine

### 2.5L QR25DE (4-Cylinder)
**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage if not monitored. May be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential repair of piston rings or valve seals. Regular oil level checks are crucial.
- **Cost:** $800 - $2500

**CVT Belt Slippage/Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Hesitation during acceleration, slipping sensation, loud whining noises, or complete loss of drive. Often preceded by transmission fluid issues.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid flush and replacement, or in severe cases, transmission rebuild or replacement.
- **Cost:** $2500 - $5000


## Transmission

### CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)
**Overheating**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission warning light illumination, reduced engine power, and potential failure during prolonged or heavy use.
- **Solution:** Ensure proper cooling system function, check transmission fluid level and condition, and consider transmission cooler upgrades.
- **Cost:** $300 - $1000

**Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
- **Symptoms:** Noticeable jolts or rough shifts between simulated gears, especially at lower speeds.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid service, recalibration of the CVT control module, or potential internal component wear.

### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Nissan Rogue, while generally a dependable compact SUV, exhibits some common concerns primarily related to its powertrain. The most frequently cited issues involve the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), including overheating, harsh shifting, and potential belt slippage or failure, which can be costly to repair. Engine-related concerns, such as oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, also require attention and regular monitoring. Other areas like suspension, electrical systems, exterior, and interior components appear to be relatively robust with no widespread significant problems reported. Prospective buyers should be particularly diligent in inspecting the CVT and engine for any signs of wear or malfunction, and factor in potential maintenance costs associated with these components.
