### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Nissan Rogue is a generally reliable compact SUV, but it's not without its potential pitfalls. The most significant concerns tend to be related to the CVT transmission, which can experience issues like hesitation, shuddering, or overheating, often requiring costly repairs. Engine-related problems, such as oil consumption and timing chain noise, are also reported. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Body Control Module and key fobs, can also arise.
