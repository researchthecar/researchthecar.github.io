The 2019 Nissan Rogue is a popular compact SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. The Rogue is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). People appreciate the Rogue for its practicality and available safety features, but some dislike its less-than-thrilling driving experience and occasionally problematic CVT transmission.

**Engine**

**2.5L I4 (QR25DE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause is crucial (e.g., worn piston rings, valve stem seals). Repairs may involve replacing these components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car may experience rough idling, stalling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) (JF016E)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint revolves around the CVT transmission exhibiting slipping, jerking, hesitation during acceleration, or a general lack of smooth power delivery. This can be more pronounced at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: A software update or replacement of the transmission may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (for software update) / $3,000 - $5,000+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure, leaving the vehicle undriveable. This can be preceded by loud noises, difficulty shifting, or significant slippage.
    *   Solution: Full transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and unusual noises (clunking) coming from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ (depending on whether front, rear, or all are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight, preventing the car from starting. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the parasitic drain. This may involve tracing the source of the drain and replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Backup Camera**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera displays a distorted image, freezes, or fails to activate altogether.
    *   Solution: Check camera wiring, and if that does not work, replace the camera.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate fails to open or close properly, often due to a faulty actuator or sensor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty liftgate actuator or sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning blows warm air, even when set to the coldest setting. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the A/C system. This may involve recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, or replacing the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,200+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Navigation/Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system freezes, reboots unexpectedly, or displays incorrect information. The infotainment system may also exhibit similar issues, such as unresponsive touch screen or Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software update, or replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 (software) $500-$1500 (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Nissan Rogue can have several potential issues, with the CVT transmission being the most prominent concern in terms of both frequency and cost of repair. Engine issues like oil consumption, electrical problems, and interior malfunctions also appear on owner complaints. While some repairs may be relatively minor, others, such as transmission replacement, can be quite expensive. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect any used 2019 Rogue before purchase.
