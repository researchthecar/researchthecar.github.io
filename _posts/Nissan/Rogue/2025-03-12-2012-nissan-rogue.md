The 2012 Nissan Rogue is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable ride. It comes equipped with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate the Rogue's spacious interior and smooth ride. Common complaints often revolve around the CVT transmission and some electrical issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L QR25DE Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust, especially upon startup.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can resolve the issue. Other times, a complete engine replacement might be necessary if the cylinder walls are damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine light illuminates due to a faulty catalytic converter, sometimes caused by excessive oil consumption. Can cause the vehicle to fail emissions testing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter. It's important to diagnose the root cause, such as oil consumption, to prevent repeat failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint is transmission slippage, especially during acceleration. Some owners report hesitation or a feeling of the transmission "hunting" for the right gear. The transmission may also exhibit jerking or shuddering.
    *   Solution: A software update may sometimes temporarily alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, a transmission replacement or rebuild is required. Regular CVT fluid changes at shorter intervals than recommended by the manufacturer might help prevent issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report a whining noise coming from the transmission, especially during acceleration or deceleration. This can be a sign of internal wear within the CVT.
    *   Solution: A transmission replacement or rebuild is typically required to address the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing premature failure of the struts and shocks, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride. This is noticeable when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks. Consider replacing both front or rear sets at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report unexplained battery drain issues, even with a relatively new battery. This can result in the vehicle not starting.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly check for parasitic draws. Common culprits include faulty door switches, aftermarket accessories, and the Body Control Module (BCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Airbag Warning Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard. This could indicate a problem with the airbag system, which needs immediate attention.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the problem using an OBD-II scanner capable of reading SRS codes. This may require repair or replacement of the clock spring, sensors, or other components of the airbag system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls:
        *   Recall Number: 13V582000
