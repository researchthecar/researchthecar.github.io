The 2017 Nissan Rogue is a compact SUV that was a popular choice for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. The Rogue is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. It's paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate the Rogue's smooth ride and user-friendly technology, but some dislike the CVT's droning sound and the engine's lack of power, especially when fully loaded.
