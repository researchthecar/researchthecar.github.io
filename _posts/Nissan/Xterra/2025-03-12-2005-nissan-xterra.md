The 2005 Nissan Xterra is a rugged and capable SUV known for its off-road prowess and utilitarian design. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 152 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque (primarily for the base model) and a more powerful 4.0L V6 generating 265 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners often appreciate the Xterra's durability and off-road capabilities, but some common complaints include fuel economy, ride quality, and certain mechanical issues that tend to surface as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6 (VQ40DE)**

*   **Timing Chain Rattle/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, especially on startup, is a common symptom. In severe cases, timing chain failure can lead to significant engine damage, including bent valves.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain and related components (guides, tensioners) is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Sending Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate fuel gauge readings or a completely non-functional fuel gauge. This often leads to the driver running out of fuel unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel sending unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency, reduced engine performance, and potential exhaust odors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (depending on location and number of converters needing replacement)

*   **"SMOD" (Strawberry Milkshake of Death) - Radiator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This issue occurs when the radiator's internal transmission cooler fails, allowing coolant to mix with the transmission fluid. The resulting mixture, often resembling a strawberry milkshake, can cause severe damage to the transmission. Shifting problems, slipping, and eventual transmission failure are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the radiator and flushing the transmission thoroughly. In severe cases, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500 (radiator and flush); $2,500 - $4,500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.

Rust is also a significant concern, particularly in colder climates. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, making a thorough inspection essential before purchasing a used 2005 Xterra.
