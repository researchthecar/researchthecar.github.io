The 2007 Nissan Xterra is a rugged, body-on-frame SUV known for its off-road capabilities and distinctive styling. It came standard with a 4.0-liter V6 engine producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. The engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Xterra for its reliability, off-road prowess, and utilitarian design. Common criticisms included its relatively poor fuel economy and somewhat dated interior.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, especially upon cold start, indicates potential wear or failure of the timing chain tensioners or guides. This can eventually lead to more serious engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor (CMP) or Crankshaft Position Sensor (CKP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough running, or a check engine light with codes related to CMP or CKP sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+

*   **Engine Oil Cooler Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the vicinity of the oil filter or onto the engine block. Over time this can reduce oil volume in the engine and cause expensive damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the oil cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **SMOD (Strawberry Milkshake of Death)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This issue occurs when the radiator cooler leaks internally, mixing coolant and transmission fluid. The resulting mixture, which resembles a strawberry milkshake, destroys the transmission. Overheating, slipping, and complete transmission failure can result.
    *   Solution: Replacing the radiator AND the transmission. Some have success with flushing the transmission multiple times if caught early, but replacement is often the only permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+

**6-Speed Manual**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken Leaves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, leading to a loss of ride height and reduced load-carrying capacity. Broken leaves are also possible.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf spring pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or popping noises from the front suspension when turning the steering wheel, along with potential for clunking over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Electrical**

*   **IPDM (Intelligent Power Distribution Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical issues including fuel pump not working, headlights not turning on, engine not starting, or intermittent stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the IPDM. The IPDM may also need to be reprogrammed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a few days of non-use. Often caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw, which could be a faulty relay, module, or aftermarket accessory.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (especially around the rear hatch and roof rack mounts)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust bubbles, surface rust, or more severe corrosion in common trouble spots.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, bodywork, and paint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on severity)

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks developing in the dashboard, particularly in sun-exposed areas.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+

*   **Door Panel Detachment**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fabric or plastic of the door panels separates from the underlying door structure.
    *   Solution: Re-gluing the panels, or replacing the entire door panel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+

**Summary**

The 2007 Nissan Xterra has a mix of potentially serious and moderately expensive problems. The "SMOD" issue with the automatic transmission is a major concern due to the high cost of repair, and can be avoided by keeping up on preventative maintenance. Timing chain issues and IPDM failures can also be costly. Rust is also a concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and perform regular maintenance to mitigate the risk of major failures.
