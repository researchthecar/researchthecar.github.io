The 2009 Nissan Xterra is a rugged and capable SUV known for its off-road prowess and utilitarian design. It came standard with a 4.0-liter V6 engine producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Xterra's dependability, off-road performance, and cargo space, but some dislike its fuel economy and relatively basic interior.
