The 2004 Nissan Xterra is a rugged and capable SUV known for its off-road prowess and utilitarian design. It appeals to those seeking a no-frills vehicle ready for adventure. However, the Xterra is also known for its somewhat dated interior and relatively poor fuel economy. The 2004 model was offered with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 and a 3.3L V6. The 2.4L produced around 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.3L V6 generated approximately 180 horsepower and 202 lb-ft of torque. The transmissions were either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level.
