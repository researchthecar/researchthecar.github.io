The 2008 Nissan Xterra is a rugged, body-on-frame SUV known for its off-road capabilities and utilitarian design. It was only available with a 4.0L VQ40DE V6 engine producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise its reliability and off-road prowess but note its poor fuel economy and somewhat dated interior.

Timing chain issues can be costly, and rust is a concern in areas with road salt. While these issues can be expensive to repair, the Xterra remains a capable and desirable SUV for those seeking off-road adventures.
