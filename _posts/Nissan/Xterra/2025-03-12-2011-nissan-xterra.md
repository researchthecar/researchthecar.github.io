The 2011 Nissan Xterra is a rugged and capable SUV known for its off-road prowess and utilitarian design. It came standard with a 4.0-liter V6 engine producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. The Xterra was available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Xterra's reliability, off-road capabilities, and simple, no-nonsense design. Common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy, a somewhat stiff ride, and limited cargo space compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2011 Nissan Xterra presents owners with a mix of potential issues, ranging from moderate to severe in terms of cost and impact. Engine-related concerns like timing chain issues and coolant leaks can be costly. Suspension problems like sagging leaf springs and electrical issues like IPDM failure also occur. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, addressing significant rust or driveline problems can result in substantial repair bills. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these common issues and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic.
