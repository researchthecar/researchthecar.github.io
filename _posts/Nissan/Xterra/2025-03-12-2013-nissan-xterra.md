The 2013 Nissan Xterra is a rugged and capable SUV known for its off-road prowess and utilitarian design. It came equipped with a single engine option, the 4.0L VQ40DE V6, producing 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Xterra's reliability, simple design, and off-road capabilities. Common dislikes include its fuel economy, somewhat dated interior, and road noise.

**Summary**

The 2013 Nissan Xterra presents a generally reliable platform, however, certain issues should be considered when purchasing. Engine-related problems, such as timing chain tensioner failure and catalytic converter issues, can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission's oil cooler can fail, potentially damaging the transmission. Suspension issues, particularly with leaf springs, are common, especially in areas with heavy use or harsh road conditions. Electrical problems related to the IPDM can also occur. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive to address. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these issues, especially rust on the frame, and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic.
