The 2002 Nissan Xterra is a rugged and capable SUV known for its off-road prowess and utilitarian design. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 143 hp and 154 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 engine producing 170 hp and 200 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Xterra's simple and durable construction, making it a reliable choice for outdoor adventures. However, common complaints often cite the dated interior, fuel economy, and some specific mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**3.3L V6**
* **Timing Belt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 3.3L V6 is an interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, the pistons will contact the valves causing extensive internal engine damage. Symptoms can include rough running, misfires, or complete engine failure.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing belt at the manufacturer's recommended interval (typically 60,000 miles) to prevent failure. If the belt breaks and causes damage, the engine may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Distributor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The distributor can fail, causing the engine to not start or run erratically. Symptoms can include no spark, misfires, and trouble codes related to the distributor.
    * Solution: Replacing the distributor with a new or remanufactured unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Knock Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The knock sensor can fail, causing the engine to lose power and efficiency. Symptoms can include poor fuel economy, rough idling, and a check engine light with codes related to the knock sensor.
    * Solution: Replacing the knock sensor. This often requires intake manifold removal, increasing labor costs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to become loose and potentially jump timing. Symptoms can include rattling noises from the engine, rough running, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $900+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various locations on the engine, such as the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location of the leak
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shifting Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Can develop shifting problems such as harsh shifts, slipping, or failure to shift into certain gears. This can be caused by worn-out friction plates, faulty solenoids, or a failing valve body.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty components, rebuilding the transmission, or replacing the transmission with a new or remanufactured unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**
* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs can sag over time, leading to a reduced ride height and poor handling. In extreme cases, the leaf springs can break.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaf springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Ball Joint Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The upper and lower ball joints can wear out, leading to play in the suspension and potentially causing the vehicle to become unsafe to drive. Symptoms can include clunking noises, wandering steering, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacing the ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Fuel Gauge Inaccuracy**
    * Description/Symptoms: Fuel gauge may not accurately reflect the amount of fuel in the tank. This can be caused by a faulty fuel level sensor in the fuel tank.
    * Solution: Replacing the fuel level sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Alternator may fail, resulting in a dead battery and a non-starting vehicle. Symptoms can include dimming headlights, a check engine light, and a battery light.
    * Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop in various areas, especially in areas with heavy road salt use. Common areas include the frame, rocker panels, and wheel wells.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Nissan Xterra has several potential issues, with the severity and cost varying depending on the specific problem. Engine issues, particularly timing belt/chain related problems on both engine options, can be costly if not addressed promptly. Suspension issues like leaf spring sag and ball joint wear are common due to the vehicle's age and off-road capabilities. Electrical problems such as fuel gauge inaccuracies and alternator failure can also occur. Rust is a significant concern in certain climates. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be more substantial, making pre-purchase inspections and preventative maintenance crucial for maintaining this vehicle.
