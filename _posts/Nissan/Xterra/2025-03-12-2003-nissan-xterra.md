The 2003 Nissan Xterra is a rugged and capable SUV known for its off-road prowess and utilitarian design. It came with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 and a 3.3L V6. The 3.3L V6 produced around 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, offering a significant power boost over the base 4-cylinder. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Xterra's simple, durable construction and off-road capability, but some dislike the relatively low fuel economy and dated interior.

**Summary**

The 2003 Nissan Xterra is a generally reliable SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the 3.3L V6 engine's timing belt and distributor, the automatic transmission's torque converter, suspension components like leaf springs and strut mounts, and electrical problems like fuel gauge inaccuracies. Rust on lower body panels is also a common issue, especially in areas with road salt. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others like transmission overhauls can be costly. Addressing these issues proactively can help ensure the longevity and reliability of the vehicle.
