The 2014 Nissan Xterra, particularly with its robust 4.0L V6 engine and available manual transmission, is generally a reliable vehicle, especially for off-road enthusiasts. The most commonly cited technical issues revolve around the automatic transmission's shifting behavior and potential leaks from the oil cooler gasket. Timing chain wear is also a concern for higher mileage examples. However, many components, including the suspension, electrical systems, exterior, and interior, do not suffer from widespread, recurring problems. Regular maintenance is key to longevity, but owners should be aware of the potential for transmission and engine-related repairs as the vehicle ages.
