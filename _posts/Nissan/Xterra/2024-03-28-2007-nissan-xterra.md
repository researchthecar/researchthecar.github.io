**Introduction:**

The 2007 Nissan Xterra is a mid-size SUV known for its rugged appearance and off-road capabilities. It offers two engine options: a 2.4L I-4 with 166 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 with 265 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission.

Owners praise the Xterra for its reliable performance, ample interior space, and off-roading prowess. However, some issues have been reported with the vehicle.

**Engine**

**2.4L I-4**

* **Oil consumption:** The engine may consume excessive oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacing the piston rings and valve seals can solve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: "None Found"
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner may fail, causing the timing chain to skip, resulting in engine damage.

    * Recalls: "None Found"
* **Throttle position sensor failure:** The throttle position sensor may fail, leading to erratic engine behavior, stalling, and decreased fuel efficiency.
    * Solution: Replacing the throttle position sensor is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: "None Found"

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Grinding gears:** The transmission may grind gears, especially when shifting between 1st and 2nd gears.
    * Solution: Adjusting or replacing the clutch and/or transmission synchronizers may resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: "None Found"
* **Leaking fluid:** The transmission may leak fluid, causing slipping gears and transmission damage.
