The 2001 Nissan Xterra is a compact SUV known for its ruggedness and off-road capabilities. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 producing 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate its simple design and off-road prowess, while common dislikes include its fuel economy and relatively spartan interior.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**
* **Timing Belt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 2.4L engine uses a timing belt. If the timing belt breaks, it can cause catastrophic engine damage, especially if the engine is an interference engine (valves and pistons collide). Symptoms include the engine not starting, unusual noises from the engine, or visible damage to the timing belt cover.
    * Solution: Replace the timing belt at the recommended interval (typically around 60,000 miles). If the belt breaks, the engine may need significant repairs, including valve replacement or even a complete engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the extent of damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6**
* **Distributor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 3.3L V6 engine's distributor is prone to failure. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, difficulty starting, and a check engine light. The distributor sends the signals to the spark plugs.
    * Solution: Replace the distributor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Knock Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The knock sensor can fail, leading to reduced engine performance and fuel economy. A check engine light will usually illuminate.
    * Solution: Replace the knock sensor. This repair can be labor-intensive as the sensor is located under the intake manifold.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slipping/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission is known to develop slipping issues, especially in higher mileage vehicles. This can manifest as delayed engagement, difficulty shifting, or a complete loss of drive.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid change *may* temporarily alleviate the issue, but often a transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $1500 - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and eventual failure of the lower ball joints can occur. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and loose steering. If a ball joint fails completely, it can cause a loss of control.
    * Solution: Replace the lower ball joints. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Idler Arm Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive play and eventual failure of the idler arm can occur, causing steering wander and increased tire wear. This is more common in vehicles that see regular off-road use.
    * Solution: Replace the idler arm.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Fuel Gauge Inaccuracy**
    * Description/Symptoms: Fuel gauge can be inaccurate due to a faulty sending unit in the fuel tank.
    * Solution: Replace fuel sending unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power window motors can fail, preventing the windows from operating correctly.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per window.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust (Frame and Body)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust is a common issue, especially in areas with road salt. Frame rust can compromise structural integrity. Body rust often appears around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    * Solution: Repairing rust can range from minor patching to extensive welding or panel replacement. In severe cases, frame replacement may be necessary, though often not economically viable. Prevention (rust proofing) is key.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on severity
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack due to sun exposure and age, particularly in warmer climates.
    * Solution: Dash replacement or using a dash cover
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (dash cover) - $500+ (dash replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Nissan Xterra is a capable SUV that can suffer from age-related issues. Engine issues like timing belt and distributor failures can be costly if ignored. Transmission slipping is a common concern in higher mileage vehicles. Suspension components such as ball joints and idler arms can also fail, especially with off-road use. Rust, especially on the frame, is a significant concern depending on the vehicle's location and maintenance history. Interior issues like cracked dashboards are mostly cosmetic. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, emphasizing the importance of a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2001 Xterra.
