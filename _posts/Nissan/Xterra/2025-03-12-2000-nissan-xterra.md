The 2000 Nissan Xterra is a compact SUV known for its ruggedness and off-road capabilities. The base engine is a 2.4L inline-four cylinder engine producing around 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. An optional 3.3L V6 engine provides more power, with approximately 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Xterra's simple design and durability, but some common complaints include rust issues, particularly in areas with harsh winters, and some reliability concerns as the vehicles age.
