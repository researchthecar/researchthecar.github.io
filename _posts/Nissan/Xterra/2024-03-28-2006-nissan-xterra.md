**Introduction:**

The 2006 Nissan Xterra is a mid-size SUV that offers two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 and a 4.0L V6. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. The Xterra is known for its rugged exterior and spacious interior, but it has faced some reliability issues over the years.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Throttle Position Sensor Failure:** The throttle position sensor (TPS) can fail, causing the engine to run erratically or even stall. Symptoms include rough idling, poor acceleration, and engine stalling. The TPS can be replaced at a cost of $100-$200.
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** The intake manifold gasket can leak, allowing coolant and oil to mix. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, overheating, and loss of coolant. The gasket can be replaced at a cost of $200-$400.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to slacken and jump. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, reduced power, and engine misfires. The tensioner and timing chain can be replaced at a cost of $500-$800.

**4.0L V6**

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** The valve cover gaskets can leak, causing oil to leak onto the engine. Symptoms include oil stains on the engine, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels. The gaskets can be replaced at a cost of $150-$300.
* **Exhaust Manifold Leak:** The exhaust manifold can crack or warp, causing exhaust gases to leak. Symptoms include a loud exhaust noise, reduced power, and a burning smell. The exhaust manifold can be replaced at a cost of $200-$400.
* **Water Pump Failure:** The water pump can fail, causing the engine to overheat. Symptoms include a rise in engine temperature, steam from the engine, and a squealing noise from the water pump. The water pump can be replaced at a cost of $300-$500.

**Transmission**

* **5-Speed Manual:** No major issues found.
* **5-Speed Automatic:**
    * **Torque Converter Lock-Up Clutch Failure:** The torque converter lock-up clutch can fail, causing the transmission to slip and shudder. Symptoms include a loss of power, transmission slipping, and a shuddering sensation when shifting. The torque converter can be replaced at a cost of $500-$800.
    * **Valve Body Failure:** The valve body can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or not shift at all. Symptoms include hard shifting, delayed shifting, and transmission slipping. The valve body can be replaced at a cost of $300-$500.

**Suspension**

* **Ball Joint Wear:** The ball joints can wear out, causing a clunking noise and reduced steering control. Symptoms include a clunking noise when turning, vibration in the steering wheel, and uneven tire wear. The ball joints can be replaced at a cost of $150-$300 per side.
* **Leaf Spring Sag:** The rear leaf springs can sag, causing the vehicle to sit lower in the rear and reduce suspension travel. Symptoms include a lower ride height, reduced handling, and a rough ride. The leaf springs can be replaced at a cost of $200-$400 per side.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to lose power and the vehicle to stall. Symptoms include a dim or flickering dashboard, a dead battery, and a screeching noise from the alternator. The alternator can be replaced at a cost of $300-$500.
* **Battery Drain:** A parasitic electrical load can drain the battery, making it difficult to start the vehicle. Symptoms include a dead battery after a short period of time, a flickering dashboard, and an excessive amount of drain on the battery. The electrical system should be inspected and repaired to fix the parasitic drain. Cost varies depending on the cause of the drain.
* **Headlight Switch Failure:** The headlight switch can fail, causing the headlights to not turn on or to flicker. Symptoms include headlights that do not turn on, flickering headlights, or a loose or broken headlight switch. The headlight switch can be replaced at a cost of $100-$200.

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate Hinge Corrosion:** The tailgate hinges can corrode, making it difficult to open or close the tailgate. Symptoms include rust on the hinges, a creaking or grinding noise when opening or closing the tailgate, and a loose or drooping tailgate. The hinges can be replaced at a cost of $200-$400.
* **Windshield Washer Pump Failure:** The windshield washer pump can fail, preventing the windshield washers from working. Symptoms include no fluid spraying from the windshield washers, a humming or clicking noise from the pump, and a leaking fluid reservoir. The pump can be replaced at a cost of $50-$100.

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure:** The HVAC blower motor resistor can fail, preventing the fan from working on certain speeds. Symptoms include the fan only blowing on one speed, no fan speed, or a burnt smell from the center console. The resistor can be replaced at a cost of $50-$100.
* **Dashboard Panel Squeaks and Rattles:** The dashboard panel can develop squeaks and rattles, especially over uneven terrain. Symptoms include annoying noises coming from the dashboard, such as rattling, creaking, or buzzing. The dashboard panel can be tightened or replaced to fix the noises. Cost varies depending on the severity of the issue.
* **Keyless Entry Remote Failure:** The keyless entry remote can fail to lock or unlock the vehicle. Symptoms include the remote not working from a distance, having to press the buttons multiple times, or intermittent locking/unlocking issues. The remote can be replaced at a cost of $100-$200.

**Recalls:**

* NHTSA Campaign ID: 06V221000: Engine stalling due to a faulty crankshaft position sensor
* NHTSA Campaign ID: 07V192000: Power window switch can fail, causing the windows to operate intermittently or not at all
* NHTSA Campaign ID: 08V074000: Rear seat belt buckle may not latch properly

**Summary:**

The 2006 Nissan Xterra has a mixed record in terms of reliability. The 2.4L inline-4 engine is generally more reliable than the 4.0L V6, which has a history of valve cover gasket leaks and water pump failures. The 5-speed automatic transmission has some reported issues with the torque converter and valve body, while the 5-speed manual transmission is relatively trouble-free. Suspension issues include ball joint wear and leaf spring sag, and electrical problems include alternator failure, battery drain, and headlight switch failure. Exterior issues are limited to tailgate hinge corrosion and windshield washer pump failure, while interior issues include HVAC blower motor resistor failure, dashboard panel squeaks and rattles, and keyless entry remote failure. Overall, the severity of the issues is moderate, but the cost to repair them can be expensive in some cases.
