### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Nissan Xterra, particularly models with the 3.3L V6, can be prone to timing belt and head gasket issues, which are significant repairs. The 4.0L V6 generally fares better but has had reports of camshaft sensor and oil cooler line leaks. Automatic transmissions, especially the older 4-speed, can experience torque converter problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items for an off-road-capable vehicle. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can also arise. Rust is a concern for vehicles in certain climates. Overall, while capable, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
