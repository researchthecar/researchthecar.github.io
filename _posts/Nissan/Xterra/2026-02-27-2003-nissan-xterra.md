### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Nissan Xterra is a capable off-roader with a generally robust mechanical foundation. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as head gasket failures on the 4-cylinder engine and intake manifold leaks on the supercharged V6. Automatic transmission problems like harsh shifting can also arise. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the instrument cluster and power windows, are not uncommon. Exterior rust, especially on the frame, is a significant concern for longevity in certain climates. Interior wear, like HVAC blower motor failure, is also reported. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and addressing these known issues, the Xterra can remain a reliable vehicle.
