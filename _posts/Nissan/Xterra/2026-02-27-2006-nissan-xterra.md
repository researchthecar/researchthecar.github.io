### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Nissan Xterra is a capable off-roader with a generally solid reputation. However, potential buyers and current owners should be aware of specific recurring issues. The V6 engines, particularly the older 3.3L, can be prone to timing belt and head gasket problems, while the 4.0L may experience sensor or oil line issues. Automatic transmission problems, such as harsh shifting, are also noted. On the suspension, worn bushings and leaf springs are common. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and premature alternator failure can occur. Exterior paint issues and interior wear on seats are also reported. Despite these potential drawbacks, addressing them proactively can help maintain the Xterra's legendary durability.
