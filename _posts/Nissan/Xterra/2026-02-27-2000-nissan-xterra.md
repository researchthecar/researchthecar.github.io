### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Nissan Xterra is a capable and generally reliable SUV, especially concerning its core powertrain components. The 2.4L engine, while robust, can be susceptible to head gasket issues and oil leaks as it ages. Both manual and automatic transmissions are generally durable, though clutch wear is expected on manuals, and automatics may develop harsh shifting over time. Common issues outside the powertrain include suspension wear (ball joints, tie rods, shocks), electrical quirks like instrument cluster problems, and exterior concerns such as rust, particularly on the frame. Interior wear on seats is also not uncommon. Regular maintenance and addressing early signs of wear can significantly extend the life of this vehicle.
