The 2016 Nissan Titan XD was a redesigned truck positioned between a light-duty and heavy-duty pickup. It was available with two engine options: a 5.6L V8 gasoline engine producing 390 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque and a 5.0L Cummins turbodiesel V8 producing 310 horsepower and 555 lb-ft of torque. The gasoline engine was paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel engine was paired with an Aisin 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciated the Titan XD's unique positioning, offering more capability than a typical half-ton truck. Common complaints included a rough ride, lower than expected fuel economy (especially with the diesel), and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**
The 2016 Nissan Titan XD had a mixed reputation. The diesel engine offered strong towing capabilities but was also prone to expensive issues like turbocharger and DPF failures. The gasoline engine was more reliable but still suffered from issues like fuel injector and camshaft actuator problems. Both transmissions had some reports of harsh shifting. Suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior issues were also reported. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues varied, with some being relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, while others could be major and costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchase decision.
