The 2019 Nissan Titan XD is a heavy-duty version of the standard Titan pickup truck, offering increased towing and payload capacity. It was offered with a 5.6L Endurance V8 gasoline engine producing 390 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque, paired with an Aisin A460 6-speed automatic transmission, as well as a 5.0L Cummins V8 Turbo Diesel producing 310 horsepower and 555 lb-ft of torque, paired with an Aisin A460 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Titan XD for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong towing capabilities. Common complaints include lower than expected fuel economy, some reliability concerns, and a less refined driving experience compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2019 Nissan Titan XD has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The diesel engine option seems to have more potential problems related to the turbocharger, DPF, and EGR valve, which can be costly to repair. The gasoline engine can suffer from engine knocking, pinging, and oil leaks. The Aisin transmission may experience harsh shifting or slipping in both engine configurations. Electrical problems can surface with the infotainment system and various sensors. Exterior corrosion can be an issue in areas with road salt. Interior problems include seat discomfort and rattling noises. While some issues are relatively minor, others, particularly those related to the diesel engine and transmission, can be quite expensive to fix.
