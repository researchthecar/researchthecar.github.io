*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine knocking or pinging, especially under heavy load or acceleration. This can be a sign of improper fuel combustion.
    *   Solution: Using higher octane fuel and checking/replacing spark plugs are the first steps. In some cases, a software update or more extensive engine diagnostics might be necessary to address the underlying cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 5.6L V8 engine consumes an unusual amount of oil between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored closely.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and possible diagnostics to check for leaks. The PCV valve could be sticking open, causing excessive oil to be sucked into the intake manifold.

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips on gear changes at higher RPM's. RPMs rev higher than expected, without the vehicle accelerating.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, a fluid change might help. In more severe cases, replacement of the entire transmission is needed.
