**Introduction to the 2023 Nissan Titan XD**

The 2023 Nissan Titan XD is a full-size pickup truck available in four trim levels: S, SV, PRO-4X, and Platinum Reserve. It offers two engine options: a 5.6-liter V8 with 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque and a turbocharged 5.0-liter V8 diesel with 310 horsepower and 555 lb-ft of torque. Both engines come standard with a 9-speed automatic transmission.

The Titan XD is praised for its powerful engines, spacious interior, and excellent towing and payload capabilities. However, it is also criticized for its dated interior design, poor fuel economy, and lack of advanced driver-assist features.
