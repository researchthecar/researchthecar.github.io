The 2024 Nissan TITAN XD is a full-size pickup truck built for those needing a bit more capability than a standard half-ton. The TITAN XD only comes with one engine option, the 5.6L Endurance V8, which produces 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and standard safety features. Common complaints revolve around its fuel economy, aging design compared to competitors, and overall value proposition.
