## Engine

### 3.5L V6 (VQ35DD)
**Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Check engine light, rough idle, reduced engine power, rattling noise from the engine.
- **Solution:** Replacement of faulty VVT actuator and potentially related components like camshaft phasers.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1200

**Oil Leaks (Valve Covers/Oil Pan)**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil drips under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level.
- **Solution:** Replacement of valve cover gaskets or oil pan gasket.
- **Cost:** $300 - $800


### 2.5L 4-Cylinder Hybrid (QR25DER)
**Hybrid System Battery Degradation**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced electric-only driving range, decreased fuel efficiency, warning lights related to hybrid system.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the hybrid battery pack.
- **Cost:** $3000 - $6000

**Electric Motor/Generator Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Whining noises, loss of power assist, check hybrid system warning.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential replacement of the electric motor/generator unit.
- **Cost:** $2000 - $5000


## Transmission

### CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)
**Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission feels like it's slipping, jerky movements when accelerating or decelerating, delayed engagement.
- **Solution:** Software update for the transmission control module, or in severe cases, transmission fluid flush and filter replacement or full transmission rebuild/replacement.
- **Cost:** $400 - $3500

**Overheating**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission warning light, burning smell, reduced performance after prolonged driving.
- **Solution:** Check transmission fluid level and condition, inspect for leaks, and potentially add a transmission cooler.
- **Cost:** $200 - $700

### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Nissan Pathfinder presents a mixed reliability profile. The V6 engine has some documented issues with its Variable Valve Timing system and potential oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. The hybrid model, while offering better fuel economy, carries the risk of expensive hybrid battery degradation and electric motor problems. The CVT transmission is a common point of concern, with reports of hesitation, jerking, and overheating, often requiring significant repair costs. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components generally appear to be robust with no widespread reported failures. Prospective buyers should be particularly mindful of the transmission and engine specifics when considering a 2013 Pathfinder.
