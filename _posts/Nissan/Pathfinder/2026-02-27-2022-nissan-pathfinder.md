The suspension and exterior/interior elements also appear to be holding up well. The primary areas of concern, though not widespread, are related to the electrical system, specifically occasional infotainment glitches that may require software updates or resets, and a few reports of premature 12V battery failure. These are relatively minor compared to major mechanical failures and are generally manageable with standard repair procedures. Overall, the 2022 Pathfinder is considered a reliable choice for its segment, with most potential issues being minor and addressable.
