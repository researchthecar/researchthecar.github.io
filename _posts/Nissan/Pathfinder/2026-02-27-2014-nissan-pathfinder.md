## Engine

### 3.5L V6 (VQ35DD)
**CVT Transmission Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Hesitation during acceleration, rough shifting, whining noises, potential for complete failure.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid change and filter replacement, recalibration of the CVT, or complete transmission replacement.
- **Cost:** $300 - $800 (fluid/filter), $4,000 - $7,000 (replacement)

**Coolant Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Overheating, visible coolant puddles under the vehicle, sweet smell.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of leaking hoses, radiator, water pump, or head gasket.
- **Cost:** $150 - $500 (hoses/minor leaks), $800 - $1,500 (water pump/radiator), $2,000 - $3,500 (head gasket)


### 2.5L Hybrid (QR25DER)
**CVT Transmission Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Similar to the V6, including hesitation, rough shifting, and potential failure.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid change and filter replacement, recalibration, or complete transmission replacement.
- **Cost:** $300 - $800 (fluid/filter), $4,000 - $7,000 (replacement)

**Hybrid Battery Pack Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced electric-only range, reduced overall power, warning lights on the dashboard.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential replacement of hybrid battery modules or the entire battery pack.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $5,000


## Transmission

### CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)
**Overheating and Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Jerking, slipping, loud noises, loss of power, transmission warning light.
- **Solution:** Regular fluid changes and filter replacements are crucial. In severe cases, transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
- **Cost:** $300 - $800 (maintenance), $4,000 - $7,000 (replacement)

### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Nissan Pathfinder, particularly with the V6 engine and CVT transmission, has a notable history of CVT-related issues, including overheating and premature failure, which can be costly to repair. The hybrid model also shares CVT concerns and can experience issues with its battery pack. Electrical problems, such as infotainment system glitches and intermittent battery drain, are also reported. While suspension, exterior, and interior components are generally reliable, potential buyers should be aware of the transmission's sensitivity to maintenance and the possibility of electrical gremlins. Regular maintenance, especially of the CVT fluid, is highly recommended to mitigate potential problems.
