The 2017 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV that was offered with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 284 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Pathfinder's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. However, some common complaints include CVT transmission issues, electrical problems, and interior accessory issues.
