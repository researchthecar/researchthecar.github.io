The 2020 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 284 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque. The Pathfinder is only offered with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While owners generally appreciate its practicality and smooth ride, common criticisms include lackluster fuel economy and the somewhat unrefined performance of the CVT transmission.
