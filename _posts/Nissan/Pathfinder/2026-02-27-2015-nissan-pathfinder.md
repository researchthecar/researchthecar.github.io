### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Nissan Pathfinder offers a generally dependable ownership experience, with its 3.5L V6 engine proving robust. However, the primary area of concern is the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), which has been associated with issues like overheating, hesitation, and premature failure, often requiring costly repairs or replacement. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and intermittent battery drain, are also noted. While the suspension, exterior, and most interior components are reliable, owners should be particularly mindful of CVT maintenance and potential electrical quirks. Proactive maintenance, especially for the transmission, is recommended.
