The 2000 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV known for its ruggedness and off-road capability. It came with two engine options: a 3.3L VG33E V6 producing 168 hp and 196 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5L VQ35DE V6 producing 240 hp and 265 lb-ft of torque, both typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2000 Nissan Pathfinder, while generally reliable for its time, exhibits common issues related to its age. Engine issues, particularly distributor and timing belt tensioner failures, are significant concerns. Transmission problems can be costly to address. Suspension components wear out, and electrical issues can arise. Rust is also a major factor, especially in regions with harsh winters. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission overhauls, or significant rust repair.
