**Introduction to the 2020 Nissan Pathfinder**

The 2020 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV offering a comfortable and spacious cabin for up to eight passengers. It comes with a standard 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 284 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Other engine and transmission options include a hybrid 3.5-liter V6 with two electric motors that produce a combined 250 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque, mated to a CVT. People appreciate the Pathfinder's roomy interior, well-tuned suspension, and affordable price. However, some criticize its lackluster performance, outdated infotainment system, and uninspiring interior design.
