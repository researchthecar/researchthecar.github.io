The 2022 Nissan Pathfinder marked a significant redesign for the popular SUV, moving away from the previous generation's rounded styling to a more rugged and truck-like appearance. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 284 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Pathfinder for its improved interior, comfortable ride, and enhanced technology features. However, some common complaints revolve around the transmission's performance, particularly rough shifting in certain situations, and some issues with the infotainment system's responsiveness.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover gasket onto the exhaust manifold, resulting in a burning oil smell and potential smoke. Visible oil residue around the valve covers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, especially between lower gears. Hesitation or delay when accelerating from a stop or during passing maneuvers. This is caused by the transmission control module's (TCM) adaptive learning not properly calibrating to the driver's habits, and also potentially caused by an issue with the valve body.
    *   Solution: A software update to the TCM to improve shift quality or replacement of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for software update, $1000 - $3000+ for valve body replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs rise without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This issue seems to be more prevelant in the early production 2022 model year Pathfinders.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transmission assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or exhibits significant lag when navigating menus or using features like Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software update to the infotainment system, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $150+ for software update (if not covered under warranty), $500 - $1500+ for unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Blind Spot Monitoring, Lane Departure Warning)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or constant error messages related to the blind spot monitoring or lane departure warning systems. System fails to activate or provides false alerts.
    *   Solution: Recalibration or replacement of the affected sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises (Dashboard/Trim)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or squeaking sounds emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces, especially when driving on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and securing or replacing the affected trim piece. This may require foam padding or felt to be installed to eliminate vibration and noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Third Row Seat Latch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty folding or unfolding the third-row seats due to a malfunctioning latch mechanism. The seat may get stuck or fail to lock securely in place.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the third-row seat latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Alignment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch sits misaligned with the rest of the body, causing wind noise, water leaks, or difficulty closing properly.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the rear hatch hinges and latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Nissan Pathfinder generally exhibits a mix of minor and moderate issues. The most significant concerns center around the 9-speed automatic transmission, with reports of rough shifting and occasional slipping that could lead to costly repairs. Electrical glitches, primarily related to the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions, also appear with some frequency. Interior rattles and exterior alignment problems are less critical but can still detract from the overall ownership experience. While many of these issues may be covered under warranty, it's crucial for potential buyers to be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
