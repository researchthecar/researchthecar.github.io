The 2015 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV that seats seven passengers. The Pathfinder is generally praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. However, some common complaints include the continuously variable transmission (CVT) performance and reliability, and some electrical issues. All 2015 Pathfinders are equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 260 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a CVT.
