### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Nissan Pathfinder presents a generally reliable profile for a mid-size SUV. The 3.5L V6 engine is robust, though owners should be aware of potential oil leaks and VVT actuator issues, which are manageable with timely repairs. The CVT transmission, while generally smooth, has seen reports of hesitation and overheating, often addressable with software updates or fluid services, but can require costly replacement in severe cases. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are the most commonly cited non-routine issues. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread problems. Overall, the Pathfinder is a solid choice, but prospective buyers should consider the potential for transmission and electrical system attention.
