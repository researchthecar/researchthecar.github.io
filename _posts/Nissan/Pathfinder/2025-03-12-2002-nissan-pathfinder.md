The 2002 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV known for its ruggedness and off-road capability. It came with two engine options: a 3.5L V6 producing 240 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque and a 3.3L V6 producing 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate its reliability (when maintained), spacious interior, and capable 4WD system. However, common complaints include issues with rust, certain electrical components, and some powertrain components as the vehicle ages.

**Summary**

The 2002 Nissan Pathfinder, while generally reliable, is prone to certain issues related to its age. Engine issues, particularly timing chain tensioner failure in the 3.5L V6 and MAF sensor failure in the 3.3L V6, can be costly to repair. Transmission slipping and harsh shifting can also require significant investment. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. While some electrical and interior issues are relatively minor, the potential for rust and powertrain problems should be carefully considered when evaluating a used 2002 Pathfinder.
