## 2023 Nissan Pathfinder

The 2023 Nissan Pathfinder is a midsize SUV that offers a choice of two powertrain options: a 3.5L V6 engine paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission or a 2.5L 4-cylinder engine paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The V6 engine produces 284 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque, while the 4-cylinder engine produces 188 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. The Pathfinder comes standard with front-wheel drive, but all-wheel drive is available as an option.

The Pathfinder is praised for its roomy interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. However, it has also received some criticism for its uninspiring exterior design and lack of off-road capability.
