The 2011 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV known for its ruggedness and off-road capabilities. It offered two engine options: a 4.0-liter V6 producing 266 horsepower and 288 lb-ft of torque and a 5.6-liter V8 producing 310 horsepower and 388 lb-ft of torque. The V6 was generally paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 was often found with a different, heavier-duty 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Pathfinder's spacious interior and towing capacity, but some dislike its fuel economy and dated interior design.
