### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Nissan Pathfinder demonstrates a generally good reliability record, with its 3.5L V6 engine being a robust powerplant. The primary area of concern for this model year is the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), which has seen reports of hesitation, shuddering, and overheating, potentially leading to costly repairs. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Exterior paint defects and sunroof leaks are less common but have been reported. Interior components like the climate control system and seat upholstery can experience wear or malfunction over time. Overall, while not immune to issues, the Pathfinder is a reasonably dependable SUV, with the CVT being the most significant factor to monitor for potential long-term reliability.
