### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Nissan Pathfinder is a capable SUV with a generally strong powertrain, especially the V6 engine. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as oil leaks from the timing chain cover gasket and intake manifold gasket failures. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic, can arise, leading to harsh shifting. Suspension components like ball joints and struts are also wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window motors and instrument clusters, can occur. Exterior rust is a concern, especially in rust-belt regions. Interior comfort systems like the HVAC blower motor can also be a point of failure. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and addressing problems promptly, the 2003 Pathfinder can remain a reliable vehicle.
