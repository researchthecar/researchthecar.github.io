The 2006 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV that offered a blend of utility and comfort. The main engine option was the 4.0L V6, producing approximately 266 horsepower and 288 lb-ft of torque. The 2006 model year was equipped with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciated the Pathfinder's off-road capabilities and spacious interior. Common complaints often revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the transmission, fuel gauge accuracy and timing chain failures.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6 (VQ40DE)**

*   **Timing Chain Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or rattling noise from the front of the engine, particularly on start-up or during acceleration. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to camshaft or crankshaft position correlation. Can eventually lead to severe engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. In some cases, camshaft sprockets may also need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Sending Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate fuel gauge readings. The gauge may show empty even when the tank is full, or vice versa. The "low fuel" light may illuminate prematurely or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel sending unit, which is located inside the fuel tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, check engine light with codes indicating catalyst inefficiency (e.g., P0420).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (RE5R05A)**

*   **"SMOD" (Strawberry Milkshake of Death) - Radiator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid mixes with coolant due to internal failure of the radiator's transmission cooler. The mixture appears pink or milky (hence, "strawberry milkshake"). Results in transmission damage and eventual failure due to coolant contamination. Symptoms include transmission slipping, rough shifting, overheating, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacing the radiator with an updated design to prevent future failure. A complete transmission flush and inspection are necessary. If the transmission is already damaged, a rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Radiator Replacement $300 - $800+. Transmission Flush: $150 - $300. Transmission Rebuild/Replacement: $2500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission hesitates or slips during gear changes, shifts roughly, or fails to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Could be due to worn clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid. Requires diagnosis and potentially a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Change $100 - $300, Valve Body Repair $500 - $1500, Rebuild/Replacement $2500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Failure (Self-Leveling Air Suspension, if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sags, especially when loaded. Air compressor may run constantly or fail entirely. Ride quality is poor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air springs, air compressor, or height sensors. Conversion to a conventional coil spring suspension is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air Spring Replacement $400 - $1000+ per side, Compressor Replacement $500 - $1200+, Conversion to Coil Springs $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension when going over bumps. Steering may feel loose or wander.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts and potentially the struts themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **IPDM (Intelligent Power Distribution Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as difficulty starting, stalling, headlight issues, or fuel pump issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IPDM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light on the dashboard, loss of ABS functionality.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to find the faulty sensor(s) and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on body panels, especially around wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Repair rust or replacement of body panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on severity, $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof fails to open or close properly, makes excessive noise, or leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the sunroof mechanism and repair or replacement of faulty parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Nissan Pathfinder is plagued by several notable issues. The most serious include the potential for timing chain failure and the "SMOD" transmission problem which can lead to expensive repairs. Electrical issues with the IPDM and suspension problems also add to the list of potential headaches. While not every Pathfinder will experience all these problems, the frequency of these issues suggests that potential buyers should have a thorough pre-purchase inspection performed. The cost to address these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for major engine or transmission work, making it important to factor in potential repair costs when considering this vehicle.
