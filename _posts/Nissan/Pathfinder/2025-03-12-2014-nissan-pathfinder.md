The 2014 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV that was redesigned for this model year. It features a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 260 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and decent fuel economy for its class. However, common complaints include CVT issues, electrical problems, and interior accessory malfunctions.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**
*   **Engine Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. Common areas include the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the vehicle, the smell of burning oil, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. Clean the affected area after the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter can fail prematurely, causing a check engine light with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency. This can result in reduced engine performance and failed emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
*   **Transmission Failure/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is known to have issues with shuddering, slipping, and complete failure. Symptoms include hesitation during acceleration, erratic RPM fluctuations, a shaking or vibrating sensation, and the transmission failing to engage.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or fluid change might temporarily alleviate symptoms. However, often the transmission needs to be replaced or rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,500 - $5,000+ for replacement; $2,500 - $4,000+ for rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating of the CVT transmission due to strain. This can cause loss of power and a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Installation of an aftermarket transmission cooler may help alleviate the issue if it's driven frequently with heavy loads, or replacing the transmission if damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$500+ for cooler installation; $3,500 - $5,000+ for transmission replacement

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, especially when carrying passengers or cargo. This can lead to a rougher ride, reduced handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shocks and springs. Upgrading to heavy-duty springs can prevent future sagging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery can drain quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the parasitic draw using a multimeter and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation and infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, and complete failure. This can affect the radio, navigation, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In severe cases, the entire unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 for updates; $500 - $1500+ for replacement.

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may display a blank screen, distorted image, or fail to activate.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. Replace the camera if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly. The latch may not engage or disengage correctly.
    *   Solution: Replace the liftgate struts, motor, or latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning may blow warm air or fail to cool the cabin effectively. Common causes include a refrigerant leak, faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Recharge the refrigerant, repair the leak, or replace the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the issue.

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate, or may only work intermittently. This is often caused by a faulty window motor or switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the window motor or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan Pathfinder has several common issues, with the most concerning being the potential for CVT transmission failure. These failures can be costly to repair. Other notable problems include electrical issues, engine oil leaks, and interior accessory malfunctions. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like transmission replacement, can represent a significant expense. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection done and be aware of the potential for these problems.
