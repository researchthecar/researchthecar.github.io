The 2021 Nissan Pathfinder marked the end of the fourth generation before a complete redesign for the 2022 model year. The 2021 Pathfinder came equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 284 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciated the Pathfinder's spacious three-row seating and comfortable ride, while some criticized the outdated interior design compared to newer competitors and the CVT's performance, especially under heavy load.
