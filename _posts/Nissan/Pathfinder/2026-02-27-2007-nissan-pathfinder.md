### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Nissan Pathfinder is a capable SUV, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 4.0L V6 engine can experience timing chain rattle and oil leaks, while the 5-speed automatic transmission may develop shifting problems or overheat. Suspension components, particularly front-end parts and Nivomat shocks, can require attention. Electrical gremlins like instrument cluster or BCM failures are also reported. Exterior issues such as failing hatch struts and paint degradation, along with interior problems like HVAC blower motor failure and sunroof drain clogs, are not uncommon. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Pathfinders remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
