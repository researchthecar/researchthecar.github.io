The 2024 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV offering a blend of practicality and comfort, targeting families needing space and capability. A key selling point is its spacious interior and user-friendly technology. However, some common dislikes include the perceived lack of driving excitement compared to rivals, and some find the continuously variable transmission (CVT) to be less engaging than traditional automatic transmissions. It is only offered with one engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 284 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can cause rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light to illuminate. Faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors are possible causes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of the misfire. Replacing faulty ignition components or cleaning/replacing fuel injectors is the common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In other cases, replacement of the transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hesitation or Delay in Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay or hesitation when accelerating, especially from a stop. This can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: Could be related to the transmission control module (TCM) software, requiring a reflash or update. If the problem is mechanical, a transmission rebuild or replacement is needed.

**Summary**

The 2024 Nissan Pathfinder, while generally reliable, has exhibited issues primarily relating to the transmission, electrical system, and engine. Transmission issues (harsh shifting and hesitations) appear to be the most concerning, with repair costs potentially reaching significant levels if a full replacement is needed. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sensors can be annoying and may require software updates or component replacements. Engine issues are also a concern. Interior noises are less severe but can detract from the overall driving experience. It's important to note that many of these issues are not widespread and affect only a subset of vehicles. As with any car purchase, a thorough inspection and test drive are highly recommended.
