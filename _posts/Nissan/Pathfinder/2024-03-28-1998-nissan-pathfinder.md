The 1998 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV known for its rugged off-road capabilities and versatile interior. It comes with two engine options: a 3.3L V6 engine and a 3.5L V6 engine. The 3.3L V6 produces 168 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.5L V6 generates 210 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission.

Owners praise the Pathfinder for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and impressive towing capacity. However, it has been subject to a number of issues over the years.

**Engine**

**3.3L V6**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil leaks. This can lead to overheating and engine damage. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and engine overheating. **Solution:** Replace the intake manifold gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $500
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to slip. This can lead to engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, loss of power, and check engine light. **Solution:** Replace the timing chain tensioner. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $800

**3.5L V6**

* **No major issues reported**

**Transmission**

**4-speed Automatic**

* **Transmission fluid leak:** The transmission fluid can leak from the transmission pan or cooler lines. This can lead to transmission damage. Symptoms include slipping gears, delayed shifting, and a burnt smell. **Solution:** Replace the leaking part. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing the transmission to slip or shudder. This can lead to transmission damage. Symptoms include slipping gears, shuddering, and a buzzing noise from the transmission. **Solution:** Replace the torque converter. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000 - $1,500

**5-speed Manual**

* **No major issues reported**

**Suspension**

* **Strut failure:** The struts can fail, causing the vehicle to sag and lose stability. This can lead to premature tire wear and suspension damage. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, excessive sway, and uneven tire wear. **Solution:** Replace the struts. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $400 - $600
* **Control arm bushings:** The control arm bushings can wear out, causing the control arms to move excessively. This can lead to premature tire wear and suspension damage. Symptoms include a clunking sound from the suspension, vibration, and uneven tire wear. **Solution:** Replace the control arm bushings. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to drain and the vehicle to lose power. Symptoms include dimming lights, flickering electronics, and a dead battery. **Solution:** Replace the alternator. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $500
* **Battery terminal corrosion:** The battery terminals can corrode, which can prevent the battery from providing power to the vehicle. Symptoms include a slow start, flickering lights, and a dead battery. **Solution:** Clean the battery terminals. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $50 - $100

**Exterior**

* **Headlight switch failure:** The headlight switch can fail, causing the headlights to malfunction. Symptoms include headlights that do not turn on, flicker, or stay on even when the switch is off. **Solution:** Replace the headlight switch. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $200

**Interior**

* **Power window failure:** The power window motors or switches can fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. Symptoms include windows that do not roll up or down, or windows that close or open slowly. **Solution:** Replace the faulty motor or switch. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400

**Summary**

The 1998 Nissan Pathfinder is a reliable SUV with some known issues. Engine issues, such as intake manifold gasket failure and timing chain tensioner failure, are moderate in severity and cost. Transmission issues, such as fluid leaks and torque converter failure, are more severe and expensive to fix. Suspension issues, such as strut failure and control arm bushing wear, are moderate in severity and cost. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure and battery terminal corrosion, are minor and inexpensive to fix. Interior issues, such as power window failure, are minor and inexpensive to fix. Overall, the Pathfinder is a solid choice for those looking for a mid-size SUV with good off-road capabilities, but it is important to be aware of the potential issues before purchasing.
