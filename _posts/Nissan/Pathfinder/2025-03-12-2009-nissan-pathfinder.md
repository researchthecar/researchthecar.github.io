The 2009 Nissan Pathfinder is a mid-size SUV known for its ruggedness and off-road capability, although it also serves well as a family vehicle. Engine options included a 4.0L V6 producing 266 horsepower and 288 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.6L V8, generating 310 horsepower and 388 lb-ft of torque. The V6 and V8 engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Pathfinder's ample cargo space, towing capacity, and available four-wheel drive. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy and some reliability issues.
