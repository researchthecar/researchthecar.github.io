## 2007 Nissan Pathfinder

The 2007 Nissan Pathfinder is a midsize SUV with three rows of seats and is available in various trims. It is powered by a 4.0L V6 engine that produces 266 horsepower and 288 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Pathfinder is known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and robust V6 engine. However, it has faced some reliability concerns over the years.

### Engine

**4.0L V6**

* **Valve Body Failure:** Premature failure of the valve body within the transmission can cause shifting issues, delayed engagement, and rough shifting. The valve body must be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A faulty intake manifold gasket can cause a vacuum leak, resulting in rough idling, poor acceleration, and increased emissions. The intake manifold gasket must be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
* **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure:** A faulty crankshaft position sensor can send incorrect signals to the engine's computer, leading to engine stalling, hard starting, and reduced power. The crankshaft position sensor must be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** A failing timing chain tensioner can cause the timing chain to skip, resulting in catastrophic engine damage. The timing chain tensioner and timing chain must be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

### Transmission

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Control Module (TCM) Failure:** A faulty TCM can cause shifting issues, delayed engagement, and rough shifting. The TCM must be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200

**Suspension**

* **Rear Sway Bar Link Failure:** A worn or damaged rear sway bar link can cause knocking or rattling noises from the rear suspension, especially when cornering. The sway bar link must be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** A parasitic drain on the battery can cause a dead battery over time. The source of the drain must be identified and repaired. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the source of the drain
* **Power Window Switch Failure:** The power window switches can fail, preventing windows from being operated. The switches must be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per switch

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Panel Leakage:** A faulty seal around the sunroof panel can allow water to leak into the cabin. The sunroof seal must be replaced, and the sunroof panel may need to be adjusted. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**Interior**

* **Radio Display Screen Failure:** The radio display screen can fail, resulting in a blank screen or distorted display. The display screen must be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800
* **HVAC Control Unit Failure:** A faulty HVAC control unit can cause issues with climate control, such as malfunctioning temperature settings, fan speed, or air flow direction. The HVAC control unit must be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600

**Summary**

The 2007 Nissan Pathfinder has some notable reliability issues, particularly with its engine and transmission. The valve body failure, intake manifold gasket leak, and timing chain tensioner failure are serious concerns that can result in costly repairs. The transmission control module failure can also cause significant shifting problems. Additionally, electrical issues and sunroof panel leakage can be inconvenient and expensive to fix. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems before purchasing a used 2007 Nissan Pathfinder.
