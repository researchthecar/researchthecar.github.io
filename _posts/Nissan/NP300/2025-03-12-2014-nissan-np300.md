The 2014 Nissan NP300 is a workhorse pickup truck known for its ruggedness and affordability. Popular for its reliability and load-carrying capacity, the NP300 also has some drawbacks. Some drivers have noted the basic interior, relatively unrefined ride quality, and engine noise. Engine options for the 2014 model included a 2.5-liter inline-4 diesel engine producing around 131-133 horsepower and approximately 221 lb-ft of torque, depending on the market. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual and sometimes a 6-speed manual.

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan NP300 is generally a reliable truck, but owners should be aware of the common issues. Engine issues, particularly with the diesel engine, can be costly, especially turbocharger and injector failures. Suspension issues, mainly leaf spring problems, affect the vehicle's load-carrying capability and ride quality. Electrical issues such as alternator or crankshaft sensor failures are also common and can lead to starting and performance problems. Rust and dashboard cracks are more cosmetic but can decrease the vehicle's value. Overall, it is a cost-effective vehicle but owners should be prepared for the possibility of these issues.
