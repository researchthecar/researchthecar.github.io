The 2017 Nissan NP300 Navara is a popular pickup truck known for its ruggedness and practicality. Engine options for this model year included a 2.5-liter petrol engine, a 2.5-liter diesel engine, and a 2.3-liter diesel engine. The 2.5-liter diesel engine produces around 161 horsepower and 403 Nm of torque. Transmission options typically consisted of a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the NP300's payload capacity, off-road capability, and overall value for money. Common criticisms include a relatively basic interior and ride quality that can be harsh, especially when unladen.

**Engine**

**2.3-liter Diesel Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between service intervals. This may manifest as a low oil warning light or noticeable oil level drop on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: The specific solution depends on the root cause of the oil consumption, but potential fixes include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or addressing turbocharger issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the cause.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF blockage can occur, especially with frequent short journeys. Symptoms include a DPF warning light, reduced engine performance, and increased fuel consumption.
    *   Solution: Attempt a forced DPF regeneration. If that fails, the DPF may need professional cleaning or replacement. Ensure the vehicle is driven at high speed for extended periods of time to ensure the filter can properly regenerate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on the solution and severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.5-liter Diesel Engine**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature timing chain wear or failure. Symptoms include rattling noises from the engine, particularly on startup, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear or failure is a relatively common complaint. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, and a high or spongy clutch pedal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and potentially the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2500+ depending on the solution and severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially when carrying heavy loads regularly. This results in a reduced ride height and compromised load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs. Upgrading to heavy-duty leaf springs is an option for those who frequently carry heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure of the central locking system is a reported issue. This may manifest as doors not locking or unlocking with the remote or interior switch.
    *   Solution: Check and replace the central locking actuator motors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per door
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, particularly if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rust developing, especially in areas prone to stone chips or salt exposure (e.g., around wheel arches, door sills).
    *   Solution: Remove rust and repaint the affected area. Apply rust protection measures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on the severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in hot climates, has been reported.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Nissan NP300 Navara, while generally a reliable workhorse, does exhibit some common issues. Engine and transmission problems, particularly related to oil consumption, timing chains, clutch failure, and rough shifting, can be relatively costly to repair. Suspension issues like leaf spring sagging can impact load-carrying ability. Electrical faults with central locking and battery drain are also reported. Rust is always a potential concern, depending on the vehicle's environment. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used NP300 before purchase.
