### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Nissan NP300 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its robust chassis and suspension designed for heavy-duty use. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the diesel engine's emissions control system, specifically the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and EGR valve, which can require attention if not maintained properly or if subjected to frequent short trips. The 7-speed automatic transmission has occasionally been reported to exhibit harsh shifting, often rectifiable with software updates or fluid services. The manual transmission and other systems like the electrical, exterior, and interior components are generally free from widespread issues. Regular maintenance, especially for the diesel engine, is key to ensuring long-term reliability.
