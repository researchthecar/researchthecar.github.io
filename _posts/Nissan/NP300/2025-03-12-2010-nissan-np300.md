The 2010 Nissan NP300 is a robust and reliable workhorse, often appreciated for its simple design, durability, and affordability. It's a popular choice for those needing a practical pickup for work or daily tasks. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues and complaints. Available engine options for the 2010 NP300 include the 2.5L YD25DDTi diesel engine (producing around 131 hp and 228 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific tune) and the 2.4L KA24DE petrol engine (producing around 141 hp and 154 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual. While owners often praise the NP300's ruggedness and load-carrying capabilities, common criticisms include a somewhat basic interior, limited safety features, and engine wear in some configurations.
