The 2021 Nissan NP300 is a popular pickup truck known for its ruggedness and practicality. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 diesel engine producing around 161 hp and 403 Nm of torque, and a 2.5L inline-4 petrol engine producing around 158 hp and 233 Nm of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed automatic (depending on the market and engine). Owners often praise the NP300 for its reliability, affordability, and off-road capability. Common complaints revolve around the base model's lack of features, a somewhat spartan interior, and ride comfort.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Diesel**

* **Excessive Engine Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Louder than normal diesel engine noise, often described as knocking or rattling, especially during cold starts. This could potentially be injector knock or excessive lifter noise.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a mechanic to pinpoint the source of the noise. Could involve injector cleaning/replacement, lifter replacement, or timing chain inspection.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause; injector replacement could range from $200 - $800 per injector, while lifter replacement or timing chain work could be significantly more.

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: DPF warning light illuminated, reduced engine power, and potential for the engine to enter limp mode. Frequent regeneration cycles.
    * Solution: Forced DPF regeneration by a mechanic, DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement. Address any underlying issues causing excessive soot build-up (e.g., faulty sensors, injectors).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Forced regeneration around $100 - $300; DPF cleaning $300 - $500; DPF replacement $800 - $2000+.

**2.5L Inline-4 Petrol**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Difficult Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, especially first or second, grinding noises during shifts, or a notchy feel to the gear lever.
    * Solution: Check and adjust the clutch cable or hydraulic system. Replace worn clutch components (clutch disc, pressure plate, throw-out bearing). Inspect shift linkage for damage or wear.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Clutch replacement $500 - $1500+, shift linkage repair $100 - $500+.

**7-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Jerking sensation when changing gears.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. Inspect valve body for wear or damage. Potentially valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission fluid flush $150 - $300; valve body replacement $800 - $2000+; transmission rebuild $3000 - $6000+.

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking or groaning noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    * Solution: Lubricate the leaf spring bushings with a silicone-based lubricant. Replace worn or damaged bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Lubrication $20 - $50; bushing replacement $100 - $300 per bushing.

* **Shock Absorber Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the shock absorbers, bouncy or unstable ride, and reduced handling.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per pair, depending on the brand and labor costs.

**Electrical**

* **Faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine running rough, poor fuel economy, stalling, and the check engine light illuminating.
    * Solution: Replace the MAF sensor. Ensure the replacement sensor is a genuine or high-quality aftermarket part.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+.

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery draining overnight or after a short period of inactivity. Difficulty starting the engine.
    * Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Possible causes include a faulty alternator, a malfunctioning electrical component, or a short circuit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause; could range from $50 for a simple fix to several hundred or even thousands for more complex issues.

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning system blowing warm air, reduced cooling performance, or no air conditioning at all.
    * Solution: Check the refrigerant level and recharge the system. Inspect the compressor, condenser, and evaporator for leaks or damage. Replace faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Refrigerant recharge $50 - $150; compressor replacement $400 - $1200+; condenser or evaporator replacement $500 - $1500+.

* **Radio/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: System freezes, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, or complete failure of the unit.
    * Solution: Check for software updates and install them. Reset the system to factory settings. Replace the head unit if necessary.

**Summary:**

The 2021 Nissan NP300 exhibits a range of potential issues, from relatively minor annoyances like leaf spring squeaks to more significant concerns such as DPF problems in the diesel engine or transmission harshness. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely. Electrical and air conditioning problems are also common. Addressing these issues promptly can prevent them from escalating into more costly repairs.
