### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Nissan NP300 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its chassis and basic electrical systems. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the diesel engine's emissions control systems, specifically the DPF and EGR valve, which can require attention if not maintained properly or if subjected to frequent short trips. The automatic transmission has also seen some reports of hesitation or rough shifting, often addressable with software updates or fluid maintenance. The manual transmission and other major components like suspension, exterior, and interior generally perform without widespread issues. Owners should be mindful of the diesel emissions systems and ensure regular servicing, especially if the vehicle is used for city driving.
