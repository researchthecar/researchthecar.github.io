The 2022 Nissan NP300 (also known as the Navara in some markets) is a popular pickup truck known for its ruggedness and practicality. Engine options vary depending on the market, but common choices include a 2.5L naturally aspirated petrol engine (around 166 hp and 178 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.5L turbodiesel engine (ranging from 161-190 hp and 297-332 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific variant). Transmission options typically include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the NP300's durability, off-road capabilities, and value for money. However, some common complaints revolve around ride comfort (especially when unladen), and the quality of some interior materials.
