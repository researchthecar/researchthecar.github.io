### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Nissan NP300 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its mechanical components like the chassis and manual transmission. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the diesel engine's emissions control systems, specifically the DPF and EGR, which can require maintenance or repair due to the nature of diesel operation. The automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit shifting issues. However, these are not universally reported and often manageable with proper servicing. Electrical, exterior, and interior components are generally robust. For owners who maintain their vehicles diligently, especially regarding emissions systems, the NP300 should provide dependable service.
