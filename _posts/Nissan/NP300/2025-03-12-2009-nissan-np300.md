The 2009 Nissan NP300 is a robust workhorse known for its reliability and affordability, appealing to those needing a practical and dependable pickup truck. Engine options for the 2009 NP300 include a 2.5L inline-4 diesel engine producing around 133 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 148 horsepower and 153 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the NP300's ruggedness and payload capacity, but some dislike its basic interior and relatively unrefined driving experience compared to more modern pickups.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine misfires. Can lead to engine stalling in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). It's often recommended to replace all injectors at once for consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per injector, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the turbocharger, loss of power, increased black smoke from the exhaust, and potential oil leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the turbocharger for damage or wear. Repair or replace the turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ for turbocharger replacement, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4 Gasoline**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illuminated check engine light (usually with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency), reduced engine performance, and potential failure to pass emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage (engine revs high but the vehicle doesn't accelerate properly), difficulty shifting gears, a spongy or vibrating clutch pedal, and potential clutch noises.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. It's often recommended to resurface or replace the flywheel as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into specific gears, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission, focusing on replacing the worn synchros.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+, depending on the extent of the damage and whether the transmission is rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height in the rear, poor ride quality, and potential clunking noises from the rear suspension. In severe cases, the leaf spring can break.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per leaf spring, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll in corners, and oil leaks from the shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shock absorber(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per shock absorber, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard (battery light), difficulty starting the vehicle, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as lights not working, sensors malfunctioning, or the vehicle not starting. This is more prevalent in areas with high humidity or road salt use.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the corroded wiring harness sections. This can be time-consuming and expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in Rust-Prone Areas)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on body panels, particularly around wheel wells, door sills, and undercarriage. Can lead to structural damage if left untreated.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted body panels. Apply rust-proofing treatments to prevent further corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+, depending on the extent of the rust.

**Summary**

The 2009 Nissan NP300, while generally reliable, can experience issues related to its age and use. Engine problems like fuel injector and turbocharger failures (on the diesel) and catalytic converter failure (on the gasoline engine) can be costly. Transmission issues like clutch and synchro wear are also common. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs and shocks, are prone to wear and tear. Electrical problems stemming from alternator failure and wiring harness corrosion can also occur. Rust is a significant concern, especially in certain climates. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or extensive rust repair, can be quite costly. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common issues before purchasing.
