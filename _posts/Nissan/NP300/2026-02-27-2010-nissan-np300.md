### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Nissan NP300 demonstrates a commendable level of reliability, particularly for its class and intended use. The petrol engine options are generally robust with few reported significant faults. The diesel variants, while offering better torque and fuel economy, can be susceptible to turbocharger and injector issues, which are not uncommon for this type of engine but require attention. Transmission reliability is decent, though manual clutches will eventually wear, and automatic transmissions might exhibit harsh shifting. Suspension components, especially bushings and ball joints, are typical wear items for a vehicle of this age and load-carrying capacity. Overall, the NP300 is a dependable workhorse, with most potential issues being manageable and related to the stresses of commercial use or age rather than inherent design flaws.
