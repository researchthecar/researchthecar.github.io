**Introduction:**

The 2014 Nissan NP300 is a versatile pickup truck known for its rugged design and off-road capabilities. It is powered by a 2.5L diesel engine that produces 163 horsepower and 297 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed automatic. Despite its popularity, the NP300 has faced several common issues reported by owners.

**Engine**

* **2.5L Diesel Engine:**
    * **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail prematurely, resulting in reduced engine power and increased exhaust smoke.
    * **Injector Failure:** Injectors may fail, leading to rough idling, misfires, and poor fuel economy.
    * **EGR Cooler Failure:** The EGR cooler can clog or fail, resulting in engine overheating and reduced performance.
    * **Timing Chain Stretch:** The timing chain may stretch over time, causing engine noise and potential catastrophic failure if not addressed.

**Transmission**

* **6-Speed Manual:**
    * **Grinding Noises:** Grinding noises during gear changes may indicate worn synchros or damaged gears.
    * **Shifter Problems:** The shifter may become loose or difficult to shift, especially when engaging reverse gear.
* **7-Speed Automatic:**
    * **Shift Hesitation:** The transmission may hesitate or stutter during gear changes, indicating faulty solenoids or a malfunctioning valve body.
    * **Overheating:** The transmission may overheat, resulting in reduced power and potential failure if not addressed promptly.

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Failure:** Rear leaf springs can sag or break, affecting ride quality and handling.
* **Shock Absorber Failure:** Worn or leaky shock absorbers can reduce ride comfort and compromise handling.
* **Ball Joint Play:** Excessive play in the ball joints can cause clunking or knocking noises and affect steering precision.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Excessive battery drain may occur due to faulty electrical components or a weak alternator.
* **ElectricalGlitches:** Occasional electrical glitches, such as flickering lights or malfunctioning gauges, may indicate loose connections or a failing control module.

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Rear Bumper:** The rear bumper may rust prematurely, especially in areas with high humidity or road salt.
* **Headlight Condensation:** Headlights may accumulate moisture during rainy or humid conditions.

**Interior**

* **Seat Adjustment Failure:** The power seat adjustment mechanism may fail, making it difficult or impossible to adjust the seat position.
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may malfunction, resulting in erratic temperature control or air distribution issues.

**Summary:**

The 2014 Nissan NP300 has a range of issues that can affect its reliability and durability. The engine and transmission issues can be costly to repair, while the suspension and electrical problems can compromise safety and performance. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and address them promptly when they arise.
