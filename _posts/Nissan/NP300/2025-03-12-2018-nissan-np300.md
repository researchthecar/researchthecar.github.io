The 2018 Nissan NP300 Navara is a popular pickup truck known for its ruggedness and practicality. Engine options for this year include a 2.5L inline-4 petrol engine (QR25DE) producing around 166 hp and 174 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5L inline-4 diesel engine (YD25DDTi) with varying power outputs depending on the market (typically around 161-188 hp and 297-332 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.3L inline-4 diesel (YD23DDT/DDTT) around 158-190 hp and 297-332 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices usually include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed automatic. Owners appreciate its comfortable ride (for a pickup), robust build, and decent fuel economy (diesel models). Common dislikes include a somewhat lackluster interior, potential for rust, and some reports of electronic glitches.

**Summary**

The 2018 Nissan NP300 Navara, while generally a reliable truck, has some common issues owners should be aware of. Engine issues range from manageable oil consumption and sensor failures to more costly injector or turbocharger problems (especially on the diesel engines). Transmission issues can be costly depending on severity, while suspension and electrical problems are fairly common. Rust is a major concern, particularly in regions with harsh climates. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission repairs. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for rust, check for any warning lights, and have the engine and transmission thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
