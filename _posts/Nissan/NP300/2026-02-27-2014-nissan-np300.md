### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Nissan NP300 demonstrates a commendable level of reliability, particularly for a vehicle designed for commercial use. While the petrol engine options are generally trouble-free, the diesel variants can occasionally experience issues with the turbocharger and injectors, which are not uncommon for high-mileage diesel engines. Transmission reliability is decent, though clutch wear on manual models and potential fluid leaks on automatics are points to monitor. Suspension components, especially bushings and ball joints, may require attention due to the nature of its work. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are also noted. Overall, the NP300 is a dependable choice, but routine maintenance and awareness of potential diesel-specific issues are key to ensuring long-term serviceability.
