### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Nissan GT-R is a formidable performance machine with a generally robust mechanical foundation. The twin-turbo V6 and dual-clutch transmission are the heart of its performance, but also the most common sources of significant repair costs when issues arise, particularly turbochargers and clutch packs. Owners should be vigilant for signs of fluid leaks and listen for unusual noises. While electrical gremlins and suspension component failures can occur, they are less prevalent than powertrain concerns. Regular maintenance and mindful driving, especially avoiding excessive abuse, are key to maintaining the GT-R's legendary performance and reliability.
