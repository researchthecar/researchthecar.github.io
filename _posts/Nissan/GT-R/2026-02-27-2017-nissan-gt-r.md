### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Nissan GT-R is a marvel of engineering, but its high-performance nature means certain components are under significant stress. The most commonly reported issues revolve around the complex dual-clutch transmission, particularly clutch pack wear, and potential turbocharger problems. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, can also occur. While the engine itself is robust, its supporting systems like oil coolers can be a source of leaks. The suspension's adaptive dampers, while enhancing performance, can be costly to repair if they fail. Owners should budget for potential repairs, especially for the transmission and turbochargers, and ensure regular, specialized maintenance is performed to mitigate these risks.
