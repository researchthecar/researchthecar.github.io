### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Nissan GT-R is a formidable supercar with a generally strong reliability record for its class. The core powertrain, the 3.8L twin-turbo V6 and its GR6 dual-clutch transmission, are engineered for high performance but can be susceptible to issues like turbocharger wear, clutch pack degradation, and mechatronic unit faults under demanding use or with high mileage. These are often costly repairs, reflecting the exotic nature of the vehicle. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components tend to be robust, with no widespread critical failures reported. Regular, diligent maintenance, especially concerning transmission fluid and cooling systems, is crucial for mitigating potential problems and ensuring the longevity of this performance icon.
