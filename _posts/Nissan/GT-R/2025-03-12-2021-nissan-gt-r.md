The 2021 Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car known for its impressive acceleration and handling. All 2021 GT-R models come equipped with a 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 565 horsepower and 467 lb-ft of torque (the GT-R Nismo boasts 600 hp). This engine is paired exclusively with a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. Drivers generally appreciate the GT-R's raw power and advanced all-wheel-drive system, delivering exceptional grip. However, some criticisms include the car's aging interior design, firm ride quality, and relatively high running costs.
