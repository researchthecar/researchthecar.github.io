The 2017 Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car known for its impressive power and handling capabilities. It comes equipped with a single engine option, a 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V6, which produces 565 horsepower and 467 lb-ft of torque in the base Premium and Track Edition models, while the NISMO variant boasts 600 hp and 481 lb-ft of torque. This engine is mated to a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the GT-R's blistering acceleration, advanced all-wheel-drive system, and track-ready performance. However, some common complaints include a harsh ride, dated interior, and relatively high running costs.
