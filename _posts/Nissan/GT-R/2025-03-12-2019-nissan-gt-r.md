The 2019 Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car equipped with a 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 565 horsepower and 467 lb-ft of torque (the Nismo variant produces 600 horsepower and 481 lb-ft of torque, but for the sake of simplicity, we'll focus on the base engine). All models are equipped with a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the GT-R for its blistering acceleration, impressive handling capabilities, and advanced all-wheel-drive system. However, some common complaints include its harsh ride quality, dated interior design, and relatively high maintenance costs.

**Summary**

The 2019 Nissan GT-R offers exhilarating performance, but potential buyers should be aware of potential issues. Turbocharger and transmission problems, while not universal, can be quite expensive to repair. Electrical gremlins in the infotainment system can also be a nuisance. Overall, while these issues exist, they are not necessarily widespread, and many GT-R owners experience reliable performance. However, a pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended, particularly focusing on the condition of the turbochargers, transmission, and electronics. The potential repair costs, when needed, can be significant.
