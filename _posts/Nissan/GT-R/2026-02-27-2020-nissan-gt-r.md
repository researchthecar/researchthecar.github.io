### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Nissan GT-R, while a marvel of engineering, presents a few specific areas where owners might encounter issues. The twin-turbo V6 engine can be susceptible to turbocharger problems and coolant leaks, especially under hard use. The sophisticated GR6 dual-clutch transmission, while incredibly fast, can sometimes exhibit shuddering or require attention to its clutch actuators. The adaptive suspension components, particularly dampers, may develop leaks over time. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and intermittent battery drain, are also noted. However, the exterior and interior components generally hold up well. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are crucial for maintaining the GT-R's legendary performance and reliability.
