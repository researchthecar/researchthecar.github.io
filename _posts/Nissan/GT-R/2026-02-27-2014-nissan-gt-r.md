### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Nissan GT-R is a formidable performance vehicle with a generally robust mechanical foundation. However, its high-performance nature and complex systems mean that certain components, particularly the engine's turbochargers, the GR6 dual-clutch transmission, and the adaptive suspension dampers, can be prone to issues, especially if the vehicle has been subjected to aggressive driving or insufficient maintenance. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While not indicative of a fundamentally unreliable car, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and budget for potential repairs, which can be substantial due to the specialized nature of GT-R components.
