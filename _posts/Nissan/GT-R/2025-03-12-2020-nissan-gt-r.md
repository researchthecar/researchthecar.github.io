The 2020 Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car known for its impressive acceleration, advanced all-wheel-drive system, and distinctive styling. The 2020 GT-R is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V6 engine, producing 565 horsepower and 467 lb-ft of torque in the standard trim, and 600 horsepower and 481 lb-ft of torque in the NISMO trim. All trims use a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally praise the GT-R for its exhilarating performance and handling, but some common criticisms include its dated interior, firm ride, and relatively high running costs.
