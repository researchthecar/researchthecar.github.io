The 2014 Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car known for its blistering acceleration, advanced all-wheel-drive system, and track-ready handling. All 2014 GT-Rs are equipped with a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V6 engine producing 545 horsepower and 463 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners appreciate the GT-R's incredible performance and technological sophistication. Some common criticisms include the harsh ride quality, dated interior, and relatively high running costs.

**Engine**

**3.8L Twin-Turbo VR38DETT V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various points, including valve cover gaskets, front timing cover, and rear main seal. Visible oil puddles under the car, oil consumption, and burning oil smells are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. Thorough cleaning of the engine area is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on location and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbochargers are subjected to extreme heat and pressure, and can fail over time. Symptoms include decreased boost, loss of power, whining noises from the turbos, and excessive smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed turbocharger(s). It's often recommended to replace both turbos at the same time to ensure consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Boost Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hoses and connectors in the turbocharger system can crack or loosen, causing boost leaks. Loss of power, poor fuel economy, and whistling noises are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the damaged hoses or connectors and ensuring proper tightening of clamps.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Dual-Clutch (GR6)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The GR6 transmission is known to have issues with wear on the clutch packs and shift forks, especially under high performance driving conditions. Symptoms include delayed shifting, rough shifting, clunking noises, and slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. This may involve replacing clutch packs, shift forks, solenoids, and valve body components. Reflashing the TCU (Transmission Control Unit) might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $15,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit controls the shifting of the transmission. Failures can cause erratic shifting, limp mode, and complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Mechatronic unit, along with proper coding and adaptation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gear Grinding/Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gear grinding and unusual noises during shifting can indicate internal damage to the gears or synchros within the GR6 transmission. This issue can arise from aggressive driving habits or inadequate transmission fluid maintenance.
    * Solution: A complete transmission rebuild or replacement. The rebuild process should include thorough inspection and replacement of any worn or damaged gears, synchros, bearings, and seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $7,000 - $16,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper/Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The GT-R's suspension uses electronically adjustable dampers. These dampers can leak fluid over time, leading to a decrease in ride quality and handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking dampers. It's recommended to replace dampers in pairs (front or rear) for balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Wheel bearing failure can cause a humming or grinding noise that increases with vehicle speed. Play in the wheel can also be felt when the vehicle is lifted.
    *   Solution: Wheel bearing replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per wheel.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the car, such as oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and wheel speed sensors, can fail. Symptoms vary depending on the affected sensor, but can include engine misfires, poor fuel economy, ABS/traction control issues, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor. Proper diagnosis is crucial to identify the specific sensor causing the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation and infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, and display problems. This is a common complaint, especially with older units.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In some cases, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Spoiler Delamination**

**Summary**

The 2014 Nissan GT-R offers impressive performance, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. The most concerning problems relate to the transmission and potential turbocharger failure. The transmission issues are the most likely to arise, and potentially the most costly to fix. Addressing smaller issues like oil leaks and sensor failures promptly can help prevent more significant problems down the road.
