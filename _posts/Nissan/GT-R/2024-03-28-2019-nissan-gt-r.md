**Introduction**

The 2019 Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car known for its aggressive styling and impressive performance. It comes with a twin-turbocharged 3.8L V6 engine that produces 565 horsepower and 467 lb-ft of torque. The GT-R is available with a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.

Despite its impressive capabilities, the 2019 Nissan GT-R has faced some issues reported by owners. These issues can be categorized into the following areas:

**Engine**

* **Engine**

   * **Exhaust valve failure:** Premature failure of intake and exhaust valves due to insufficient cooling. Symptoms include rough idling, misfiring, and potentially engine seizure. Solution requires replacing the affected valves and head. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
   * **Timing chain tensioner failure:** Worn or defective timing chain tensioners can cause the timing chain to skip, resulting in reduced engine power and potential catastrophic engine damage. Solution involves replacing the timing chain and tensioners. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
   * **Oil cooler leaks:** Faulty oil coolers can leak coolant into the engine oil. Symptoms may include overheating, low oil levels, and milky-brown oil. Solution: Replace the oil cooler. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Transmission**

* **6-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic Transmission**

   * **Gearbox issues:** Premature wear and tear on the transmission gears and synchros can cause difficulty shifting, grinding noises, and potentially complete transmission failure. Solution: Repair or replacement of the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+

**Suspension**

* **Rear suspension:**
   * **Rear suspension link breakage:** Corroded or weakened rear suspension links can break, affecting vehicle stability and handling. Solution: Replace the affected links. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:**
   * **Faulty trunk latch sensor:** A malfunctioning trunk latch sensor can cause a parasitic battery drain. Symptoms include a dead battery after the vehicle is parked. Solution: Replace the faulty sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+

**Exterior**

* **Door locks:**
   * **Frozen door locks:** Door locks may freeze in cold weather, causing difficulty accessing the vehicle. Solution: Lubricate the locks and consider using a de-icing agent. Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $50+

**Interior**

* **Climate control:**
   * **HVAC fan failure:** The HVAC fan can prematurely fail, resulting in insufficient airflow and heating or cooling problems. Solution: Replace the fan motor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Summary**

The 2019 Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car with impressive capabilities, but it has faced some issues that can be costly to repair. Engine and transmission issues can be particularly severe and expensive to fix. While the electrical, exterior, and interior problems are relatively minor and inexpensive, they can still be inconvenient and affect the overall ownership experience.
