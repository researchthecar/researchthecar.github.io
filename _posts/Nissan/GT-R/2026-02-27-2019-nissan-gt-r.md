### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Nissan GT-R, while a marvel of engineering, presents a reliability profile typical of a high-performance supercar. The powertrain, particularly the twin-turbo V6 engine and the GR6 dual-clutch transmission, are the most common sources of reported issues, ranging from turbocharger problems and coolant leaks to transmission fluid leaks and clutch pack wear. These issues often stem from the extreme demands placed on these components. The suspension's adaptive dampers can also experience electronic malfunctions. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. However, the exterior and interior components generally show good durability. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs and the possibility of significant repairs, especially concerning the complex drivetrain, compared to less performance-oriented vehicles.
