**Summary**

The 2011 Nissan GT-R, while an exceptional performance vehicle, can be subject to several common issues. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger problems can be costly, while transmission issues, especially clutch wear, are also a significant concern due to the high cost of repair. Suspension and electrical problems, while less frequent, can still add to the overall maintenance costs. Exterior rust can be a problem in some areas, and navigation screen failures are relatively common. Overall, owning a 2011 GT-R requires diligent maintenance and awareness of these potential issues, which can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for major component replacements.
