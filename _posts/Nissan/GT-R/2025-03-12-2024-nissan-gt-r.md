The 2024 Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car known for its powerful engine, advanced all-wheel-drive system, and aggressive styling. It comes standard with a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V6 engine producing 565 horsepower and 467 lb-ft of torque (or 600 hp and 481 lb-ft in the NISMO trim). This engine is paired exclusively with a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. Many appreciate the GT-R for its exhilarating acceleration, exceptional handling, and technologically advanced features. However, some criticisms include its relatively dated interior, stiff ride, and high price point.

**Engine**

**3.8L Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbochargers, loss of power, check engine light. This issue often stems from oil starvation or overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger(s). Thorough inspection of the oil lines and cooling system is recommended to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Boost Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, decreased fuel efficiency, hissing sound during acceleration, check engine light. Often caused by cracked or loose intercooler piping or faulty boost control solenoids.
    *   Solution: Replacing damaged hoses or pipes, tightening connections, and replacing faulty boost control solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, especially in higher gears, rough or jerky shifting, and eventual inability to transfer power to the wheels. This is more common in modified vehicles with increased power output or in vehicles that are driven aggressively.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch packs. Upgraded clutch options are available for vehicles with increased horsepower.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard, limp mode activation (reduced power), and rough or delayed shifting. More common during track use or in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Installation of an upgraded transmission cooler, fluid change with high-performance fluid, and inspection of the transmission cooling system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper (Shock Absorber) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, uneven tire wear, poor handling, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed damper(s). Replacing dampers in pairs is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ (depending on OEM vs aftermarket)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Humming or grinding noise that increases with speed. Can also lead to vibrations in the steering wheel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed wheel bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes intermittently. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software update (if available), or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update) - $2,000+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (ABS, TPMS, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard, inaccurate readings, and potential impact on vehicle safety systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor and subsequent replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Tightening loose trim pieces, adding sound-deadening material, or replacing worn clips and fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Nissan GT-R, while a performance icon, can present owners with a range of issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine and transmission, particularly turbocharger failures, clutch slippage, and transmission overheating, which can be quite expensive to address. Electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions can also occur. Suspension issues such as damper failure and wheel bearing issues are less frequent. Most of these issues range in cost depending on if the owner takes the car to the dealer or a private mechanic/performance shop. Overall, while the GT-R delivers exhilarating performance, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance and repair costs.
