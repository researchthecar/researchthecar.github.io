**Engine**

**3.8L VR38DETT Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various areas, including the valve covers, front timing cover, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the source of the leak.

*   **Boost Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbo system can develop leaks in the intercooler piping or the turbos themselves. This results in loss of power and lower boost pressure and the possible sound of air escaping.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and replacing faulty hoses and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the leak source and components needed.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Dual-Clutch**

*   **Transmission Failure/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of transmission failure or harsh shifting are relatively common on tuned or tracked vehicles but can occur on stock cars, especially those driven aggressively. Symptoms include difficulty shifting, slipping gears, loud clunking noises, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Requires transmission rebuild or replacement. Upgraded clutches and components are often recommended for improved reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $7,000 - $15,000+ for rebuild or replacement with upgraded parts.

*   **Transmission Cooler Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission cooler lines can leak, causing a loss of transmission fluid. Symptoms include visible fluid leaks and poor shift quality.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory Bilstein dampers, particularly those with the electronic control, can fail. This leads to reduced handling performance and a bouncy ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dampers. Many owners upgrade to aftermarket coilovers for improved performance and reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ for aftermarket coilovers including installation.

**Electrical**

*   **MAF Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Mass airflow sensor failures can occur, leading to poor engine performance and check engine lights.
