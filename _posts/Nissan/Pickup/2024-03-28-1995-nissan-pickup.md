The 1995 Nissan Pickup is a popular choice for those seeking a reliable and affordable workhorse. The vehicle was offered with two engine options, a 2.4 liter engine and a 3.0 liter engine, each of which could be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. While the Pickup was praised for its durability and off-road capabilities, it has been known to develop certain issues over time.

**Engine**

**2.4 Liter Engine**
