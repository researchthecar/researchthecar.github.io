The 2010 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. It was available with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 generating 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual (only with the I4), a 6-speed manual (only with the V6), and a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Frontier's ruggedness and simple design, but some common complaints include a relatively dated interior and fuel economy that isn't the best.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. Can lead to engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.0L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Guide Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.5L, a rattling or whirring noise from the engine, particularly at idle or low RPM. This is due to wear and eventual breakage of the plastic timing chain guides, potentially causing the chain to slip.
    *   Solution: Replacement of timing chain guides, timing chain, and potentially the tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Coolant Leak at Timing Chain Cover**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking from the front of the engine, often pooling near the front cover. Requires disassembly to reseal.
    *   Solution: Remove the timing chain cover, clean the surfaces, replace the gasket or sealant, and reassemble.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **"SMOD" - Strawberry Milkshake of Death**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant mixing with transmission fluid, creating a pink, milkshake-like substance. Caused by internal failure of the transmission cooler within the radiator. Results in transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replace the radiator and flush the transmission thoroughly. If the transmission has been running with contaminated fluid for an extended period, a rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+ (depending on the extent of damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs cracking or breaking, leading to a sagging rear end, poor ride quality, and potential instability when carrying loads.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **IPDM (Intelligent Power Distribution Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting problems, fuel pump issues, headlight malfunctions, and other electrical gremlins. The IPDM is essentially a fuse box and relay center, and failures can cause a variety of seemingly unrelated issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the IPDM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
* **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The blower motor only works on certain speeds, or not at all. This is due to a faulty blower motor resistor.
    * Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive rust on the frame, especially in areas with road salt. Can compromise the structural integrity of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, frame reinforcement, or in severe cases, frame replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2010 Nissan Frontier, while generally reliable, has some known issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The "SMOD" transmission issue and timing chain guide problems for the V6 are potentially serious and costly to repair. Rust on the frame can also be a major concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Checking for these issues during a pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as frame repair or transmission replacement, can be very costly.
