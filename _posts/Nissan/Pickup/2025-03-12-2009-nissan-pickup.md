The 2009 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capability. Two engine options were available: a 2.5L inline-4 and a 4.0L V6. The 2.5L engine produced around 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque. The 4.0L V6 produced around 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (2.5L only), a 6-speed manual (4.0L only) and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the truck's compact size, ruggedness, and value. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated interior and fuel economy of the V6 engine.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup. Can lead to timing chain failure and significant engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, timing chain, and potentially other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency. Reduced engine performance and fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.0L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Rattle/Guides**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise, particularly on startup or under load, indicates wear or failure of the timing chain guides and tensioners. This can lead to eventual timing chain failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially the variable valve timing (VVT) sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Sending Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate fuel gauge readings, leading to potential run-out situations.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel sending unit, typically requiring dropping the fuel tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Corrosion/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rusting, cracking, or complete breakage of the rear leaf springs, resulting in a sagging rear end, poor ride quality, and potential safety hazards.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf spring assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: **Recall Number:** 10V525000
        *   Description: ON CERTAIN PICKUP TRUCKS, THE REAR SUSPENSION LEAF SPRING COULD BREAK DUE TO CORROSION.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, including starting problems, stalling, headlight malfunctions, and other seemingly random electrical failures.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IPDM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Nissan Frontier, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. Engine problems, especially with the timing chain and catalytic converters, can be costly. Suspension issues like leaf spring corrosion are significant safety concerns that have a recall in place. The IPDM and cracked dashboards are also common complaints. While some issues like the blower motor resistor are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, potentially exceeding several thousand dollars depending on the severity.
