The 2003 Nissan Pickup, also known as the Frontier in some markets, is a compact truck appreciated for its reliability and simplicity. This model year offers a few engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing around 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 generating approximately 180 horsepower and 202 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally praise the truck's durability and off-road capability, but some dislike its fuel economy and relatively basic interior compared to newer trucks.

**Summary**

The 2003 Nissan Pickup, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to watch out for. Engine issues like timing chain/distributor problems and knock sensor failure in the V6, along with transmission problems, can be costly. Suspension components, particularly the lower ball joints and idler arm, are also common wear points. Rust, especially on the frame, is a major concern and should be thoroughly inspected before purchasing. While many of these issues are age-related, addressing them can help keep the truck running smoothly. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major repairs like engine work or frame replacement.
