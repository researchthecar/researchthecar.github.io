The 2001 Nissan Pickup, also known as the Frontier in some markets, is a compact truck known for its reliability and simplicity. The 2001 model year came with several engine options. The base engine was a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful option was the 3.3L VG33E V6 engine, producing around 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the truck's ruggedness and off-road capability, but some dislike its dated interior and less refined driving experience compared to newer trucks.
