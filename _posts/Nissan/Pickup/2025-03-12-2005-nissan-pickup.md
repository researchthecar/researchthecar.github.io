The 2005 Nissan Pickup, also known as the Frontier in North America, is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and off-road capabilities. It offered several engine options: a 2.4L Inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V6 engine delivering around 265 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate its ruggedness and practicality but some dislike the somewhat dated interior and fuel economy, especially with the V6 engine.
