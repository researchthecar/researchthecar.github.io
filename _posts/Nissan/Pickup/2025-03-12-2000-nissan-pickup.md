The 2000 Nissan Pickup, also known as the D22, is a compact truck known for its reliability and simplicity, but it is now an older vehicle and has some age-related concerns. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-four KA24DE engine producing around 143 hp and 154 lb-ft of torque and a 3.3L V6 VG33E engine making approximately 170 hp and 200 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the truck's affordability, ease of maintenance, and off-road capability. Common complaints include rust, especially in northern climates, and the age-related deterioration of various components.

**3.3L VG33E V6**

*   **Knock Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine performance, and potentially poor fuel economy. The knock sensor on this engine is prone to failure due to its location in the engine valley, which makes it susceptible to heat damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the knock sensor. Requires intake manifold removal, increasing labor cost.

**Summary**

The 2000 Nissan Pickup, while generally reliable, is now an older vehicle and suffers from age-related issues, particularly rust. Engine issues, such as knock sensor and distributor failures, can be moderate in cost to repair. Transmission issues can be more expensive, especially if a rebuild or replacement is required. Suspension and electrical problems are also common and can add to the overall cost of ownership. The severity and cost of repairs will depend heavily on the vehicle's condition and maintenance history. Rust is a major concern, particularly in colder climates, and can significantly impact the truck's value and safety.
