The 2006 Nissan Pickup, also known as the Frontier in North America, is a mid-size truck appreciated for its reliability, off-road capability, and simple design. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-4 and a 4.0L V6. The 4.0L V6 produced approximately 265 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. While owners generally liked the truck's ruggedness and practicality, common complaints included issues with rust, particularly in areas with road salt, and some drivetrain-related problems.
