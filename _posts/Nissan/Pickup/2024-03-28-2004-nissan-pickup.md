**2004 Nissan Pickup**

The 2004 Nissan Pickup, known as the Frontier in North America, was offered with a range of engine and transmission options. The 3.3L V6, producing 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, was paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The more powerful 4.0L V6, delivering 265 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque, was available with a 6-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission.
