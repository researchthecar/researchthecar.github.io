### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Nissan Pickup is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly praised for its durable powertrain options. The 2.5L 4-cylinder engine can be prone to head gasket issues and oil consumption as mileage increases, while the 4.0L V6 may experience timing chain wear. Automatic transmissions, specifically the RE5R05A, have been noted for potential issues with harsh shifting or slipping, often requiring fluid services or more extensive repairs. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear over time, leading to noises and handling issues. Electrical components such as the alternator and window motors are also potential failure points. Rust can be a concern on the frame and body, especially in corrosive environments. Despite these potential issues, with proper maintenance, the 2009 Nissan Pickup remains a capable and dependable workhorse.
