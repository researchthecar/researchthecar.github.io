**Engine**

**V6 4.0L**

* **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** Loss of oil pressure, causing engine failure.
* **Exhaust Manifold Cracking:** Leaking exhaust, causing a loss of power and fuel efficiency.
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** Coolant leak, leading to overheating and engine damage.

**V8 5.6L**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** Coolant leak, leading to overheating and engine damage.
* **Spark Plug Blowout:** Failure of spark plugs, causing misfiring and potential engine damage.

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual**

* **Grinding Gears:** Difficulty shifting gears, especially when cold.
* **Synchro Hub Failure:** Inability to shift into specific gears.

**4-speed Automatic (RE4F04B)**

* **Solenoid Pack Failure:** Transmission slipping, erratic shifting, or failure to shift.
* **Overheating:** Transmission fluid overheating, leading to premature failure.

**5-speed Automatic (RE5R05A)**

* **Solenoid Pack Failure:** Transmission slipping, erratic shifting, or failure to shift.
* **Torque Converter Shudder:** Vibration during acceleration or shifting.

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Breakage:** Failure of leaf springs, leading to loss of ride height and potential handling issues.
