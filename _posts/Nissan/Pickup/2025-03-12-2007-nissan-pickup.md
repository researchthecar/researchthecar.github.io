The 2007 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck appreciated for its reliability, off-road capability, and relatively simple design. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 cylinder and a 4.0L V6. The 2.5L produced around 152 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, while the 4.0L V6 generated approximately 261 horsepower and 281 lb-ft of torque. Common complaints about the 2007 Nissan Frontier include potential issues with the timing chain (primarily in the 4.0L V6), rust (especially in northern climates), and some minor electrical problems. People generally like the Frontier's ruggedness and value, while dislikes often center on fuel economy and interior plastics.
