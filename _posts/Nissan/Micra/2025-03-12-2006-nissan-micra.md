The 2006 Nissan Micra is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and practicality, particularly in urban environments. Available engine options include the 1.2L inline-4 (approximately 65 horsepower and 81 lb-ft of torque) and the 1.4L inline-4 (approximately 87 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were typically paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its compact size, easy maneuverability, and relatively low running costs. Common dislikes include its somewhat basic interior, limited cargo space, and perceived lack of power, especially when fully loaded or on the highway.

**Engine**

**1.2L Inline-4**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. This can be caused by worn timing chain guides and tensioners or a stretched chain. If left untreated, it can lead to more significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain kit, including the chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and reduced power. Often accompanied by the engine management light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on how many need to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warning lights, needing to add oil more frequently than expected, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include worn piston rings or valve stem seals. Repairs range from replacing these components to a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the cause and extent of damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, grinding noises when shifting, particularly into first or reverse.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by worn synchros, clutch issues, or low transmission fluid. Repair may involve replacing the clutch kit, rebuilding the transmission, or replacing worn synchros.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping Gears/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, hesitates, or shifts roughly. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, contaminated fluid, or worn internal components like valve bodies.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change first. If the problem persists, further diagnostics are needed, potentially leading to a valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $200 for fluid flush, $500 - $2500+ for rebuild or replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. The vehicle may also feel less stable in corners.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn bushings in the control arms, sway bar links, and other suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on how many bushings need to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, longer stopping distances, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn shock absorbers or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (for a pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows that operate slowly, erratically, or not at all. A clicking sound may be heard when attempting to operate the window.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster, including gauges and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include faulty wiring, connectors, or the instrument cluster itself. The cluster may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Wheel Arches and Sills**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the wheel arches and sills, particularly in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust repair and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Warning Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to determine the cause of the fault. Common causes include faulty clock spring, seatbelt pretensioner issues, or a malfunctioning airbag sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Nissan Micra, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. Engine problems, especially timing chain issues in the 1.2L and oil consumption in the 1.4L, can be costly to address. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic, can also be a concern. Suspension issues related to worn bushings are common and relatively inexpensive to fix. Electrical issues like faulty window regulators and instrument cluster problems can also occur. Rust on the exterior can be a concern in areas with road salt. The severity and cost of these repairs vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues before purchasing.
