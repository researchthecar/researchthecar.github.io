The 2015 Nissan Micra is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. In Canada, it came standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. This engine was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its low price and maneuverability in urban environments, but common criticisms include its basic features, limited power, and somewhat dated interior.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, clunking noises, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. Premature wear on other engine components due to increased vibration.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn engine mounts. It's often recommended to replace all mounts at the same time for balanced support.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illuminated check engine light (typically with a P0420 code), decreased fuel efficiency, and a sulfur-like smell coming from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter. It's crucial to diagnose the underlying cause to prevent premature failure of the new converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or delayed shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. Slipping can manifest as the engine revving high without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution can range from a transmission fluid flush and filter change to a complete transmission rebuild or replacement. A thorough diagnosis is crucial to determine the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) to $2000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts or shock absorbers. Replacing them in pairs (front or rear) is recommended for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (for a pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Stabilizer Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn stabilizer bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle struggles to start, especially after sitting for extended periods. The battery may need frequent charging.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of parasitic drain. The source may be a faulty sensor, relay, or aftermarket accessory that continues to draw power when the car is off. Sometimes, replacement of the battery itself is needed if it's old or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Window Regulator**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window is slow to go up or down, or stops part way. Window doesn't stay up. Clicking sound inside the door.
    * Solution: Replacement of the window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Hatch/Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Surface rust or, in more severe cases, rust-through on the rear hatch area or around the wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, involving sanding, treating the affected area, and repainting. In severe cases, panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks in the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replacement of the Dashboard or Dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Nissan Micra, while affordable and practical, has some common issues to be aware of. Engine mount and catalytic converter failures can be costly to address. Suspension components like struts and stabilizer bar links are prone to wear, leading to ride quality issues. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain, and rust formation on the exterior are also potential concerns. While these issues aren't necessarily widespread, they are frequent enough to warrant a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2015 Micra. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the extent of the damage and the specific component affected, but the issues are generally manageable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
