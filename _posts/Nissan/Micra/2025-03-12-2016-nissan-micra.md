The 2016 Nissan Micra is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. In North America, it was primarily offered with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing around 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. This engine was generally paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Micra's maneuverability and low price point. Common dislikes include the relatively basic interior and somewhat lackluster performance.
