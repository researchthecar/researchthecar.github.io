The 2007 Nissan Micra, also known as the Nissan March in some markets, is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and nimble handling. Engine options for this year typically include a 1.2L inline-4 (CR12DE) producing around 65 horsepower and 81 lb-ft of torque, a 1.4L inline-4 (CR14DE) with approximately 87 horsepower, and a 1.5L inline-4 (HR15DE), though availability varies by market. Transmission choices are generally a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Micra's compact size for city driving and its affordability, but some common complaints involve the car's basic features, lack of power, and potential for rust, particularly in colder climates.

**Summary**

The 2007 Nissan Micra is a generally reliable car, but like any vehicle of its age, it is susceptible to certain issues. Engine problems, particularly related to the timing chain and coil packs on the 1.2L engine, are common. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic transmission, can be costly to repair. Suspension wear is also typical. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as transmission problems or extensive rust repair, can be quite costly. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the car for these common issues before purchasing.
