The 2017 Nissan Micra is a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. In Canada, it came standard with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate its small size for city driving, ease of parking, and low price point. Common complaints revolve around its basic features, limited rear passenger space, and somewhat dated design.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, reduced fuel economy, and potential rattling noises from under the vehicle. Some owners have reported premature failure, especially in areas with harsh winters and road salt.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, poor fuel economy, rough idling, and potential hesitation during acceleration. Often caused by a faulty sensor sending incorrect data to the engine control unit (ECU).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delays when shifting gears, jerky or abrupt shifts, and potential slipping between gears. This can be caused by worn transmission fluid, a failing solenoid, or internal component wear.
    *   Solution: Flush and replace the transmission fluid. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be needed, potentially requiring solenoid replacement or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush: $150 - $300, Solenoid replacement: $300 - $800, Transmission Rebuild: $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Uneven tire wear and a feeling of looseness in the steering can also be present. This is sometimes attributed to the roads where the vehicle is being driven.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn components such as sway bar links, bushings, or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component depending on labor and parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a period. This may be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or an aging battery.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly inspect the electrical system to identify the source of the drain. Replace the battery if it is weak or failing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement: $100 - $300, Diagnostic testing: $100+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The doors may not lock or unlock reliably with the remote or the interior switches. Sometimes only one door has an issue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Surface rust can appear around the wheel wells, door edges, and other areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Sanding, treating, and repainting the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the severity and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Rattling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling sounds emanating from the center console area, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle (loose trim, wiring, etc.) and secure or insulate it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+, depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

In summary, the 2017 Nissan Micra presents a range of potential issues, from minor interior rattles to more significant problems like catalytic converter failure and transmission shifting issues. The severity of these problems varies, but some, such as the catalytic converter, can be relatively expensive to repair. Addressing these common issues can significantly improve the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
