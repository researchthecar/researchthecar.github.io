### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Nissan Micra is a generally reliable small car, particularly the petrol variant with the manual transmission. The 1.5L dCi diesel engine, while economical, has shown some susceptibility to turbocharger and EGR valve issues, which are not uncommon for this type of engine. The CVT transmission, while convenient, carries a higher risk of potential issues and associated repair costs compared to the manual. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system, are minor and often resolvable with software updates. Overall, for its class and age, the Micra offers decent reliability, with the manual petrol model being the most robust choice.
