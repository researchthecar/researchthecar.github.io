The 2023 Nissan Kicks e-Power is a subcompact SUV featuring a unique e-Power system. Unlike traditional hybrids, the gasoline engine in the Kicks e-Power (a 1.2L 3-cylinder) solely acts as a generator for the electric motor, which directly drives the wheels. This results in a driving experience similar to an EV, with instant torque and smooth acceleration. The electric motor produces around 134 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. A traditional gasoline-powered Kicks is also available with a 1.6L 4-cylinder engine. People often praise the Kicks e-Power for its fuel efficiency, quiet cabin, and maneuverability in city driving. Some criticisms include a lack of power for highway driving and a relatively basic interior.
