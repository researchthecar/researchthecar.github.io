### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Nissan Maxima is generally a reliable vehicle, particularly its V6 engine. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the CVT transmission, which can exhibit hesitation or overheating issues, and potential oil leaks from the engine's valve covers or timing cover. VVT actuator problems, while not universal, are also noted. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread, significant issues. Regular maintenance, especially for the CVT fluid, is crucial for longevity. Addressing minor oil leaks promptly can prevent more significant problems down the line.
