The 2007 Nissan Maxima is a front-wheel drive sedan known for its sporty handling and comfortable ride. It came standard with a 3.5-liter VQ35DE V6 engine producing 255 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciated the Maxima's stylish design and powerful engine, but some disliked the CVT's performance and reported various mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**3.5L VQ35DE V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2007 Maxima owners reported excessive oil consumption. The engine burns through oil faster than normal, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include needing to add oil regularly and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: There's no single, definitive fix. Regular monitoring of oil levels and using a heavier-weight oil may help. In severe cases, piston ring replacement or engine rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $5000+ depending on the severity and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature catalytic converter failure. Causes the service engine light to turn on. Can cause a loss of power and/or fuel efficiency. Can cause the vehicle to fail an emissions test.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT is known for issues, including shuddering, hesitation during acceleration, slipping, or complete failure. Warning lights (such as the service engine light) might illuminate.
    *   Solution: In many cases, the only solution is a complete CVT replacement. A few isolated incidents were resolved with a software update (reprogramming the TCU) when detected early.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature strut mount failure, leading to clunking noises over bumps and diminished ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts, often done in conjunction with replacing the struts themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Fuel Gauge**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel gauge may become inaccurate, reading empty when the tank is full or vice-versa.
    *   Solution: Replacing the fuel level sending unit within the fuel tank or the fuel gauge cluster itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **BCM (Body Control Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The BCM can cause a variety of electrical problems, including intermittent lighting issues, power window malfunctions, and security system faults.
    *   Solution: Replacing and reprogramming the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust, particularly around the wheel wells, door edges, and undercarriage, is a common complaint, especially in areas with harsh winters or coastal climates.
    *   Solution: Rust repair and repainting, or panel replacement in severe cases. Rust prevention treatments can help slow the progression.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks from the sunroof, often due to clogged drain tubes. This can lead to water stains on the headliner and potentially damage to electrical components.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and clearing the sunroof drain tubes. In some cases, resealing the sunroof may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Nissan Maxima, while offering a blend of performance and style, is prone to some notable issues. The most serious and costly of these is the potential for CVT failure, which can lead to significant repair bills. Other concerns include oil consumption, electrical gremlins, and rust, particularly in certain environments. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used 2007 Maxima before purchasing. Addressing these issues early can mitigate larger problems.
