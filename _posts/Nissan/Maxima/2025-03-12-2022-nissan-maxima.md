The 2022 Nissan Maxima is a full-size sedan known for its sporty styling and comfortable ride. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 261 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Maxima for its responsive handling, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. Common complaints include the lack of significant updates in recent years, the absence of all-wheel drive, and the CVT's performance characteristics compared to traditional automatic transmissions.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating, noticeable drop in oil level on the dipstick, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The solution can range from simple oil changes with higher-viscosity oil to replacing the piston rings or the entire engine in severe cases. A compression test can help determine the severity of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $5000+ (engine replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Juddering/Shaking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported juddering, shaking, or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to find the right gear ratio.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid flush and replacement can resolve the issue. However, more severe cases may require replacement of the CVT.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$500 (fluid flush), $3000 - $5000+ (CVT replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported complete CVT failure at relatively low mileage. Symptoms include loss of power, inability to shift, and unusual noises coming from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000-$5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Restarting the system or performing a software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, replacement of the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1000+ (head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions with safety sensors, such as the blind spot monitoring or rear cross-traffic alert systems, can occur. This can result in false warnings or a complete failure of the system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool is required to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor and recalibration of the system are typically necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per sensor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poor Quality Chrome Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature pitting, peeling, or discoloration of chrome trim pieces around windows, doors, and bumpers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected trim pieces is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ (per trim piece, depending on location and complexity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattling/Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the sunroof, especially when driving over uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the sunroof mechanism, lubricating the seals, or replacing worn components may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Nissan Maxima can be a comfortable and stylish sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The most concerning problems relate to the CVT transmission, which can suffer from juddering and, in some cases, premature failure. Engine oil consumption is another potential issue. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sensors are also reported. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs like CVT or engine replacement can be costly.
