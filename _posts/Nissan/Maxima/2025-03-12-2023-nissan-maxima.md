The 2023 Nissan Maxima is a full-size sedan offering a blend of sporty styling and comfortable features. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 261 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Maxima is often praised for its comfortable ride and user-friendly technology, but some drivers find its CVT transmission lacking in responsiveness and the rear seat headroom to be limited.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may develop from the valve cover gaskets, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the source of the leak and if any further damage has occurred.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature CVT failure, characterized by shuddering, slipping, hesitation during acceleration, and eventually complete loss of drive. This can be related to degradation of the transmission fluid, internal wear, or other unknown causes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT is often required. In some cases, a software update or valve body replacement might temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but the underlying problem usually persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,500 - $8,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT may exhibit delayed engagement when shifting from park to drive or reverse. Jerky or erratic "shifts" can also occur during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A software update or a CVT fluid flush may help in some cases. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or a complete CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 for fluid flush, $800 - $1,500 for valve body, $3,500 - $8,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and failure of the front struts can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and clunking noises when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the struts. Consider replacing both front struts at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per strut, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing or Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, the infotainment system may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software update, $1,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sensors for blind spot monitoring, parking assist, or other safety systems may malfunction, providing false alerts or failing to detect obstacles.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per sensor, including labor and diagnostic fees.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the sunroof either failing to open/close, or getting stuck during operation. Sometimes this is accompanied by clicking or grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Sunroof motor replacement, cleaning and lubrication of sunroof tracks and mechanisms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2023 Nissan Maxima, while offering a comfortable and stylish driving experience, has been subject to some reliability concerns. The most significant issues appear to revolve around the CVT transmission, which can exhibit various problems and even fail prematurely, leading to substantial repair costs. Other issues reported include oil leaks, suspension component wear, and electrical glitches, though these seem to be less frequent and generally less expensive to address. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing a used Maxima, paying particular attention to the condition and maintenance history of the CVT.
