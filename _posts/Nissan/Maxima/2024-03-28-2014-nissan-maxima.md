**Introduction:**
The 2014 Nissan Maxima is a full-size sedan known for its stylish design and comfortable interior. It is available with a choice of two engine options: a 3.5-liter V6 (VQ35DE) and a 3.5-liter V6 with direct injection (VQ35HR). Transmission options include a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or a 7-speed automatic (7AT). People enjoy the Maxima's spacious cabin, responsive handling, and powerful engine options. However, some owners have reported issues with certain components.

**Engine**

**3.5-liter V6 (VQ35DE)**
* **Timing chain noise:** A rattling noise may be heard from the engine, especially during acceleration. The timing chain and tensioner may need to be replaced.
* **Valve cover gasket leak:** Oil may leak from the valve covers, requiring the gaskets to be replaced.
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gaskets may fail, causing coolant and/or oil leaks.

**3.5-liter V6 with Direct Injection (VQ35HR)**
* **Carbon buildup on intake valves:** Carbon deposits can accumulate on the intake valves, reducing engine performance and fuel economy. This can be cleaned by removing the intake manifold and manually cleaning the valves.

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**
* **Slipping and shuddering:** The transmission may slip or shudder during acceleration or gear changes. The CVT fluid and filter should be replaced first. If the issue persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
* **Noise:** A whining or humming noise may be heard from the transmission, especially during acceleration. This could be caused by a faulty bearing or a damaged gear.

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission (7AT)**
* **Shifting problems:** The transmission may have difficulty shifting gears or may slip out of gear. A software update or a new transmission control module may be required.

**Suspension**
* **Strut mount bearing failure:** The strut mount bearings may fail, causing a clunking or rattling noise when driving over bumps. The strut mounts will need to be replaced.
* **Lower control arm bushing wear:** The lower control arm bushings may wear out, causing a knocking noise when going over bumps. The control arms may need to be replaced.

**Electrical**
* **Battery draining:** The vehicle's battery may drain prematurely, especially when parked. This could be caused by a faulty electrical component, such as a light or module.
* **Headlight flickering:** The headlights may flicker or go out intermittently. This could be caused by a faulty wiring harness or a problem with the headlight switch.

**Exterior**
* **Door handle paint peeling:** The paint on the door handles may peel or chip over time. This is a cosmetic issue that can be fixed by repainting the door handles.

**Interior**
* **Sunroof rattle:** The sunroof may rattle or squeak when opened or closed. This may be due to loose bolts or a faulty sunroof mechanism.
* **Navigation system issues:** The navigation system may malfunction or freeze. A software update or a new navigation module may be required.

**Summary:**
The 2014 Nissan Maxima has received mixed reviews from owners. While many appreciate its performance and features, others have experienced some issues. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but it is important to be aware of potential problems before purchasing this vehicle.
