The 2000 Nissan Maxima is a front-wheel-drive sedan known for its blend of sporty handling and comfortable ride. It was offered with only one engine option: the 3.0-liter VQ30DE V6 engine, producing 222 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque. The Maxima was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
