The 2020 Nissan Maxima is a full-size sedan known for its sporty handling and comfortable interior. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 261 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate the Maxima's stylish design and responsive acceleration, while others dislike the limited rear headroom and the CVT's driving feel compared to traditional automatic transmissions.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can originate from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets and the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the leak's location and complexity.

* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty camshaft position sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300

* **Knocking Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported engine knocking noises, especially when the engine is cold. This could indicate worn engine components, such as rod bearings or piston slap.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is crucial to pinpoint the source. Repair could range from minor adjustments to a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $6000+ depending on the severity

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation upon acceleration, slipping sensation, jerking, unusual noises (whining, buzzing), and eventual failure of the CVT. The car may not accelerate properly or at all. The check engine light might illuminate.
    * Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the CVT. Nissan extended the warranty on some CVTs due to widespread issues in earlier years, but this may not apply to all 2020 models.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Juddering/Shaking at Low Speeds**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable juddering or shaking sensation, particularly when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds (e.g., 10-30 mph). This is a common complaint with CVTs and can be related to the torque converter or internal CVT components.
    * Solution: A CVT fluid change *may* temporarily alleviate the issue, but it often returns. More permanent solutions involve replacing the torque converter or, in severe cases, the entire CVT.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (CVT replacement)

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mount Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces. This often indicates worn strut mounts.
    * Solution: Replacing the strut mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per pair

* **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported clunking and rattling noises coming from the rear of the vehicle when driving over bumps.
    * Solution: Diagnose the source of the noise, repair or replace worn suspension components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on what is damaged.

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or spontaneously reboots. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate controls.
    * Solution: Software updates *may* resolve the issue. If not, the infotainment unit may need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (unit replacement)

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The car's battery drains quickly, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery.
    * Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Identify any parasitic draws (components that continue to draw power when the car is off). Repair or replace faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (battery replacement), $100 - $500+ (parasitic draw diagnosis and repair)

**Exterior**

* **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The AEB system activates unnecessarily, applying the brakes when there is no apparent obstacle. Or the system does not activate when needed.
    * Solution: Check and clean the sensors on the front of the vehicle. Take the vehicle to a dealer to have the system recalibrated or diagnosed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on what is damaged.
    * Recalls:
        * 22V-672: Nissan North America, Inc. (Nissan) is recalling certain 2017-2022 Titan and 2017-2020 Armada vehicles. The trailer brake light on the affected vehicles may remain illuminated, even after the trailer brake is no longer in use.
        * 21V-213: Nissan North America, Inc. (Nissan) is recalling certain 2018-2019 Nissan Titan and 2019 Nissan Titan XD vehicles. The seat belt warning chime may not sound when the driver does not fasten their seat belt, which could increase the risk of injury during a crash.
        * 20V-593: Nissan North America, Inc. (Nissan) is recalling certain 2020 Maxima vehicles. The rear lower link fasteners may not have been tightened properly during assembly.

**Interior**

* **Heated/Cooled Seats Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The heated or cooled seats fail to operate properly, or stop working altogether.
    * Solution: Check the seat heating/cooling elements, relays, and wiring. Replace faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the faulty component.

**Summary**

The 2020 Nissan Maxima can present owners with a range of issues, with the CVT being a significant concern due to its potential for failure. Electrical issues, particularly related to the infotainment system, can also be frustrating. Oil leaks are also fairly common. The severity of these problems varies, and repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major component replacements like the CVT or engine. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to assess the condition of the CVT, engine, and other critical components. Be aware of recalls and check if the vehicle has had the proper repairs performed.
