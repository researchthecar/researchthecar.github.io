The 2005 Nissan Maxima is a front-wheel drive mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling and comfortable ride. Available engine options included a 3.5-liter V6 (VQ35DE) producing 265 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual (though the manual is significantly less common). People appreciate the Maxima for its powerful engine, stylish design, and well-equipped interior. Common complaints often revolve around electrical issues, transmission problems in the automatic versions, and certain engine issues related to oil consumption and catalytic converters.

**Engine**

**3.5L VQ35DE V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an excessive amount of oil between oil changes, often more than 1 quart per 1,000 miles. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil, blue exhaust smoke, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the valve stem seals can mitigate the issue. More severe cases might require piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the severity and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter fails prematurely, leading to a check engine light with codes related to catalytic converter inefficiency (e.g., P0420). Performance can also be affected.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on location and brand of converter.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, resulting in delayed or erratic shifts. Shifting can also be harsh and jerky.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and fluid change *may* help in mild cases. However, more often requires valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Creaking or clunking noises coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per pair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery not charging, dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard, and eventually, the car may not start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working or operate erratically. The window may get stuck in an open or closed position.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Rust development on the rear wheel arches, particularly in regions with high salt usage on roads.
    *   Solution:  Rust repair, panel replacement, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per side, depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Delaminating Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The dashboard material starts to separate and peel away, creating a sticky or bubbled surface.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (dashboard replacement), $50 - $200 (dashboard cover)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Nissan Maxima is a generally reliable vehicle, but it's not without its common issues. The most significant problems tend to revolve around the 5-speed automatic transmission (slipping/harsh shifting) and engine issues like excessive oil consumption. Electrical problems such as alternator and power window regulator failures are also relatively common.  The severity and cost of repairs vary, but transmission and engine repairs can be quite expensive.  Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase.
