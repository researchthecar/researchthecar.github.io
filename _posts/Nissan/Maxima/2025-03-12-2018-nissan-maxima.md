**Summary**

The 2018 Nissan Maxima has some notable issues, particularly with the CVT transmission, which can be expensive to repair or replace. Electrical issues and some interior component failures are also common complaints. While the engine itself is generally reliable, potential oil leaks should be monitored. The AEB system malfunction presents a safety concern and is addressed by a recall. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider having the vehicle inspected before purchase, with particular attention paid to the transmission's condition. The CVT transmission is the most severe issue, and the cost to fix this can be $3,500 - $5,000+.
