The 2015 Nissan Maxima is a full-size sedan offering a blend of sporty styling and a comfortable ride. The Maxima came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 261 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Maxima's distinctive design and responsive engine, but some common complaints include CVT reliability and certain electronic issues.

**Engine**

**3.5L VQ35DE V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored closely.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels diligently and addressing potential leaks or worn piston rings if they are the cause of the consumption. A compression test can help diagnose the health of the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $3,000+ (engine rebuild or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the timing chain tensioner, leading to a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. Can eventually cause timing chain slip and significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint is related to CVT failure, exhibiting symptoms such as slipping, hesitation, jerking, or complete loss of power. The transmission may enter a limp mode, limiting speed and performance.
    *   Solution: In many cases, CVT replacement is the only viable solution. Some have had success with valve body replacements, but this is not a guaranteed fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the struts and/or shocks. This results in a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive noise from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ (depending on parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions of the navigation or infotainment system, including freezing, crashing, unresponsive touchscreen, or failure to connect to Bluetooth devices.
    *   Solution: Software updates or replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,200+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (ABS, TPMS, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of various sensors, such as ABS sensors or TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) sensors. This triggers warning lights on the dashboard and may affect vehicle functionality.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific sensor that has failed, followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per sensor (depending on the sensor and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctions, including getting stuck open or closed, leaking, or making excessive noise during operation.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the cause, which may involve cleaning and lubricating the tracks, replacing damaged parts, or resetting the sunroof motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to function properly, or fail completely.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the cause, which may involve replacing the seat heating element.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Nissan Maxima, while praised for its styling and performance, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most concerning is the high rate of CVT failures, which can be a significant expense. Electrical issues and suspension problems are also fairly common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures. Overall, the potential cost of repairs can be high, particularly if the CVT fails. A thorough pre-purchase inspection is recommended.
