### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Nissan Maxima is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly its VQ35DE V6 engine, which is known for its power and longevity when properly maintained. The most common significant issues tend to revolve around the automatic transmission, specifically the RE5R05A, which can develop problems with harsh shifting or torque converter failure. Engine-related concerns, such as timing chain guides and oil leaks, are also notable but often manageable with timely repairs. Electrical components, especially the BCM, can be a source of intermittent problems. Suspension wear, particularly control arm bushings, is typical for a vehicle of this age. Overall, while not immune to issues, the Maxima offers a good ownership experience if common problem areas are addressed.
