Despite its positive attributes, the 2005 Maxima had several reported issues that owners experienced.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption:** The engine consumes excessive amounts of oil, leading to reduced engine oil levels and potential damage. The cause is typically worn piston rings or valve stem seals.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner fails, causing the timing chain to become loose and jump teeth. This can lead to engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner and timing chain.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Intake Camshaft Position Sensor Failure:** The intake camshaft position sensor fails, leading to incorrect timing and reduced engine performance.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift Flare:** The transmission experiences harsh shifts or slipping, especially during acceleration. The culprit is often a faulty pressure control solenoid.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty pressure control solenoid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Shudder:** The transmission shudders during acceleration or deceleration. It is caused by worn friction material in the torque converter.
