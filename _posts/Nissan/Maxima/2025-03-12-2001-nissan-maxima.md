The 2001 Nissan Maxima is a mid-size sedan known for its sporty handling and comfortable ride. The most common engine option is the 3.0L V6 (VQ30DE) producing 222 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque. A less common engine option is the 2.0L V6 (VQ20DE) producing 140 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Maxima for its powerful engine, smooth ride, and relatively upscale interior for its price point. Common complaints included issues with rust, especially in northern climates, and some reliability concerns as the vehicle aged.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6 (VQ30DE)**
