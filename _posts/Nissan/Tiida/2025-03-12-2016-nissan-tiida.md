The 2016 Nissan Tiida, also known as the Nissan Pulsar in some markets, is a compact car that offers a blend of practicality and fuel efficiency. It typically comes equipped with a 1.6-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 115 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride, the Tiida is often appreciated for its affordability and ease of use. However, some owners have reported issues relating to the CVT transmission and certain electrical components.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 Gasoline**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. This may be indicated by low oil level warnings or seeing blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic should inspect for leaks, worn valve seals, or piston ring issues. If necessary, replacing valve seals or piston rings may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Juddering/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report juddering, shuddering, or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This is often associated with the CVT transmission.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change might temporarily alleviate the issue. However, in many cases, the problem stems from internal wear and tear on the CVT belt or pulleys. Replacement of the CVT transmission is often the most effective solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ for a new or rebuilt CVT.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car may experience poor engine performance, rough idling, stalling, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light may illuminate. The code is typically P0101.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Camshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Can cause the engine to stall or not start. The check engine light may come on.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks over time, especially in regions with high sun exposure.
    *   Solution: While there is no permanent fix, dashboard covers can help to prevent further cracking and conceal existing damage. Replacement of the entire dashboard is also possible, though costly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ for a cover; $800 - $1500+ for dashboard replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2016 Nissan Tiida presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. While generally considered a practical and economical vehicle, it's essential to be aware of potential issues, particularly concerning the CVT transmission and electrical components. The CVT issues, while not universally experienced, can be costly to repair. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs can help mitigate potential problems. Overall, the Tiida is a solid choice for a budget-friendly car but requires careful consideration and proactive maintenance.
