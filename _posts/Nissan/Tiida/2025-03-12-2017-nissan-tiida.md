The 2017 Nissan Tiida (also known as the Nissan Pulsar in some markets) is a compact car known for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency. The primary engine option for this model year is a 1.8-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 129 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate its comfortable ride and practicality, but some find the styling bland and the performance uninspiring. Common complaints often revolve around the CVT transmission and certain electrical components.

**Engine**

**1.8L Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can manifest as a burning oil smell or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any leaks promptly. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ (Piston Ring Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Slipping/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: A common complaint is slipping during acceleration, especially at higher speeds. This manifests as a delay in response when pressing the accelerator, or a feeling that the engine is revving without a corresponding increase in speed. Jerking during acceleration.
    * Solution: A software update might help in some cases. Otherwise, replacement or rebuild is the most common solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Premature CVT Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience premature failure of the CVT, requiring complete replacement. Symptoms include loud whining noises, inability to accelerate, and transmission warning lights.
    * Solution: Replacement of the CVT unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

* **Faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor**
    * Description/Symptoms: The car may have poor fuel economy, run rough, stall, or have difficulty starting. A check engine light will illuminate.
    * Solution: Replacing the MAF sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining overnight or within a short period of inactivity, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic drain (e.g., faulty sensor, aftermarket accessory) and repairing or replacing the affected component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Weak Clear Coat**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners reported the clear coat on the vehicles starts to fail and peel over time.
    * Solution: The only solution is to completely sand down the existing panels to get rid of the peeling clear coat and then reapply base coat and clear coat to those panels.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning system blows warm air or fails to cool the cabin effectively. This can be due to a refrigerant leak, compressor failure, or a faulty blend door actuator.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause of the failure (e.g., leak test, compressor inspection) and repairing or replacing the affected components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1200+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2017 Nissan Tiida/Pulsar presents several potential issues, the most significant being related to the CVT transmission. These transmission problems can be costly to repair. Oil consumption issues are also a concern, although less severe in most cases. Electrical issues, such as battery drain and sensor failures, are relatively common and can add to the overall cost of ownership. While the Tiida offers practicality and fuel efficiency, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
