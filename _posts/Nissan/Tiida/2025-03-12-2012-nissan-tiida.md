The 2012 Nissan Tiida, also known as the Nissan Versa in some markets, is a compact car known for its practicality and fuel efficiency. In most markets, the 2012 Tiida was offered with a 1.6-liter HR16DE four-cylinder engine producing around 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, or a 1.8-liter MR18DE four-cylinder engine producing around 126 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual (depending on the engine and market), or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Tiida/Versa for its spacious interior and affordability. Common criticisms include its somewhat bland styling and basic interior features.

**Engine**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 1.6L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can resolve the issue. Addressing any PCV valve issues may also help. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity and chosen repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported issues with the CVT, including jerking during acceleration, hesitation, and complete transmission failure. This is a known weakness of the CVT used in many Nissan vehicles of this era.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is CVT replacement. In some cases, a software update or valve body replacement might temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but the underlying issue often persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+ for replacement

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of struts and shocks is a relatively common complaint. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive noise from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor (CKPS) can fail, causing the engine to stall, run poorly, or not start at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Mass Airflow Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mass airflow sensor (MAF) can fail, causing the engine to run poorly, have a low idle, stall, or not start at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the mass airflow sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage and Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the undercarriage, especially in regions with harsh winters and road salt use. Rust can also appear on body panels, especially around wheel wells and seams.
    *   Solution: Rust repair involves removing the rust, treating the affected area, and repainting. Prevention includes regular washing and rustproofing treatments.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on severity.

**Summary:**

The 2012 Nissan Tiida/Versa is generally a reliable and affordable vehicle, but it does have some common issues to be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for CVT failure, which can be a costly repair. Excessive oil consumption in the 1.6L engine is another potential issue. Other problems like suspension wear and electrical issues are more common and less expensive to address. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of the CVT issue and inspect the car thoroughly for any signs of these problems before purchasing.
