The 2008 Nissan Tiida, also known as the Nissan Versa in some markets, is a compact car known for its practicality and fuel efficiency. In many markets, it was offered with a 1.8-liter inline-4 gasoline engine (MR18DE) producing around 124 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Tiida for its spacious interior and ease of driving. Common complaints include a somewhat unrefined engine and basic interior features.

    * Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings may resolve the issue. A leak-down test can help determine the severity of the problem.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminating with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420). Reduced engine performance and fuel economy may also be noticed.
    * Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**
