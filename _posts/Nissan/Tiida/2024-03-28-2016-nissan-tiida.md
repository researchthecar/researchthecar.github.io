**Introduction to the 2016 Nissan Tiida**

The 2016 Nissan Tiida is a subcompact hatchback that offers a comfortable and affordable driving experience. It comes equipped with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, which produces 110 horsepower and 107 pound-feet of torque. Paired with the engine is a standard five-speed manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic transmission. Despite its modest powertrain, the Tiida offers a well-balanced ride and decent fuel economy. However, it has been known to encounter several issues, ranging from minor inconveniences to more serious mechanical problems.

**Engine**

* **1.6-liter Four-Cylinder Engine**
