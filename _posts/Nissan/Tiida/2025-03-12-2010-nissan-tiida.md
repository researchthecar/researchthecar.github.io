The 2010 Nissan Tiida, also known as the Nissan Versa in some markets, is a subcompact car known for its practicality and spacious interior for its class. Engine options for this model year included a 1.6-liter HR16DE inline-4 producing around 109 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque or a 1.8-liter MR18DE inline-4 engine producing around 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual (paired with the 1.8L), or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Tiida's fuel efficiency and affordability, but some find the handling and engine performance to be underwhelming.

**Engine**

**1.8L MR18DE**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This may be noticeable through a burning oil smell, blue smoke from the exhaust, and low oil level warnings.
    * Solution: Initially, check for external leaks. If no leaks are found, internal engine components (piston rings, valve stem seals) may be the cause. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the issue. Depending on the severity, replacing the piston rings and/or valve stem seals is required. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Failed Catalytic Converter**
    * Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter fails, often indicated by a check engine light (typically P0420 code â€“ Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold), reduced engine performance, and potentially failing emissions tests. This may also be accompanied by a rattling noise from the exhaust system.
    * Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. Verify that other engine issues (e.g., excessive oil consumption) are addressed to prevent premature failure of the new catalytic converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.6L HR16DE**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or jerky shifting, especially between gears 1-2 and 2-3. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: Begin with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement using the correct Nissan-specified fluid. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal damage may be present, requiring further diagnosis and potential replacement/rebuild of the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250 for fluid flush/filter; $500 - $2000+ for valve body or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of struts and shocks, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and shocks. It's recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced handling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for parts and labor per axle.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Noisy Wheel Bearings**
    * Description/Symptoms: A humming, grinding, or roaring noise that increases with vehicle speed, especially noticeable when turning. This indicates worn wheel bearings.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per wheel bearing.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Failed ABS Wheel Speed Sensor**
    * Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminates on the dashboard, potentially along with other warning lights (traction control, etc.). Diagnostic codes will indicate a faulty wheel speed sensor. This can affect ABS and traction control system functionality.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty wheel speed sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine may crank but not start or may stall intermittently. Check engine light will typically illuminate with a corresponding code.
    * Solution: Replacement of the crankshaft position sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rusting around the rear wheel wells/arches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust formation around the edges of the rear wheel wells/arches.
    * Solution: Removal of rust, body work repair, and repainting.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced or no cold air output from the air conditioning system. Common causes include a refrigerant leak, a failing compressor, or a clogged evaporator core.
    * Solution: Leak test and recharge of refrigerant, compressor replacement, or evaporator core replacement as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Nissan Tiida/Versa can present owners with a few common issues. The 1.8L engine shows some prevalence towards oil consumption and catalytic converter failure. The 4-speed automatic may suffer from rough shifting. Suspension components such as struts, shocks, and wheel bearings may require replacement due to wear. Electrical issues, such as failed ABS sensors or crank position sensors, may arise. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs, depending on the specific problem. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and prevent further damage.
