The 2014 Nissan Tiida, also known as the Nissan Versa in some markets, is a compact car known for its spacious interior and fuel efficiency. Engine options include a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 130 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Tiida for its affordability, fuel economy, and roomy backseat. Common complaints revolve around the car's relatively basic interior, somewhat uninspired handling, and potential issues with the CVT transmission.
