The 2007 Nissan Tiida, also known as the Nissan Versa in some markets, is a compact car appreciated for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency, and affordability. The 2007 model typically came with two engine options: a 1.5-liter HR15DE inline-4 engine, which produces around 107 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8-liter MR18DE inline-4 engine producing approximately 125 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic, and in some markets, a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) paired with the 1.8L engine. Common dislikes include somewhat bland styling and basic interior materials.

**Engine**

**1.8L MR18DE**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels indicated by the dashboard warning light.
    *   Solution: In milder cases, using a thicker grade of oil or switching to a high-mileage oil may help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (Piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Catalytic Converter**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine light illumination (Check Engine Light), OBDII codes related to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420), decreased fuel efficiency, and potential failure of emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L HR15DE**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, engine light illumination. Often caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils and/or spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts between gears, slipping during acceleration, or failure to engage a gear altogether. Can be accompanied by unusual noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can improve shifting. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $500 - $1,500 (valve body), $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven or jerky acceleration, especially from a standstill or at low speeds. Hesitation when pressing the accelerator pedal.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change with the correct Nissan CVT fluid might help. In some cases, the CVT control valve body may need replacement. In more serious cases, a CVT replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid change), $800-$2,000 (valve body), $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Poor handling and steering response.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per corner, depending on which bushings need replacement and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, uneven tire wear, leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per pair, depending on brand and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor/Camshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, rough idling, check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery repeatedly dying overnight or after short periods of inactivity. Can be caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty component or wiring.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic drain, followed by repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Wheel Arches/Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the wheel arches, rocker panels, or other lower body panels. Common in areas with road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, patching, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per panel, depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Warning Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illumination of the airbag warning light on the dashboard. Can be caused by a faulty sensor, wiring issue, or a problem with the airbag control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the airbag system, which may involve replacing a sensor, repairing wiring, or replacing the airbag control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the cause
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Nissan Tiida, while generally reliable, can experience issues common to cars of its age. Engine problems like excessive oil consumption and transmission problems, particularly with the CVT, can be costly. Suspension wear and electrical glitches also appear as potential issues. Depending on the specific problem, repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements and bushing replacements to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. While not always severe, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and inspect vehicles thoroughly before purchasing.
