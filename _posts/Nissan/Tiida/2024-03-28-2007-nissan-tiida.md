Tiida owners generally praise the vehicle's reliability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior. However, some owners have reported various issues with the vehicle, as detailed below:

**Engine**

**1.6-liter**
- **Leaking valve cover gasket:** Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket, causing decreased engine oil levels. The gasket must be replaced. $100 - $200+

**1.8-liter**
- **Timing chain failure:** The timing chain prematurely wears out, causing the engine to lose power or stall. The timing chain and related components must be replaced. $1,500 - $3,000+
- **Intake manifold gasket leak:** The intake manifold gasket fails, allowing coolant to leak into the engine. The gasket must be replaced. $200 - $300+
- **Oil consumption:** Excessive oil consumption is reported, potentially due to worn piston rings or valve guides. $1,000 - $2,000+
- **Catalytic converter failure:** The catalytic converter fails, causing reduced engine performance and increased emissions. It must be replaced. $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**5-speed manual**
- **Grinding gears:** Gears grind or pop out of place during shifting. Synchros or other internal components may need to be replaced. $500 - $1,500+

**4-speed automatic**
- **Slipping gears:** The transmission slips gears while driving, causing loss of power and rough shifting. The transmission may need to be overhauled or replaced. $1,500 - $3,000+

**CVT**
- **Shuddering or vibration:** The transmission shudders or vibrates while driving, especially during acceleration or deceleration. The CVT fluid and filter may need to be replaced, or the transmission may need to be overhauled or replaced. $1,000 - $3,000+

**Suspension**

- **Front strut mount failure:** The front strut mounts fail, causing a clunking noise and reduced handling performance. The strut mounts must be replaced. $300 - $500+

**Electrical**

- **Alternator failure:** The alternator fails, causing a loss of electrical power. The alternator must be replaced. $500 - $1,000+
- **Battery drain:** The battery drains prematurely, requiring frequent recharging. The battery may need to be replaced, or an electrical fault may need to be diagnosed and repaired. $100 - $300+

**Exterior**

- **Headlight condensation:** Moisture accumulates inside the headlights, impairing visibility. The headlights may need to be replaced or sealed. $200 - $500+

**Interior**

- **Dashboard rattle:** The dashboard rattles or squeaks, especially over rough roads. The interior trim may need to be adjusted or replaced. $100 - $300+

**Overall Summary**

The 2007 Nissan Tiida is generally a reliable vehicle, but it is not without its issues.
