The 2017 Nissan Tiida is a subcompact hatchback that offers a comfortable and practical driving experience. It comes with a choice of two engines: a 1.6-liter inline-4 and a 1.8-liter inline-4, both mated to a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Tiida is known for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency, and affordability. However, it has also been subject to a number of issues.

**Engine**

**1.6-liter Inline-4**
