The 2008 Nissan Cabstar E is a light-duty truck known for its maneuverability and practical design, often used for urban delivery and utility purposes. Engine options typically include a range of diesel engines, such as the 2.5L YD25DDTi and 3.0L ZD30DDTi, varying in horsepower and torque depending on the specific configuration. The 2.5L version can produce around 110-130 horsepower, and the 3.0L engine can produce between 130 and 150 horsepower. Common customer praises include its compact size, ease of driving in tight spaces, and relatively low running costs. Criticisms often focus on its basic interior, limited refinement compared to some competitors, and potentially higher maintenance costs associated with diesel engines.
