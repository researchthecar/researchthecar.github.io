The 2004 Nissan Tsuru, also known as the Nissan Sentra in some markets, was a popular compact sedan known for its reliability and affordability. It was primarily available with a 1.6-liter GA16DE four-cylinder engine, producing approximately 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. The Tsuru was often praised for its fuel efficiency, simple design, and ease of maintenance. However, it was criticized for its basic features, lack of modern safety equipment, and somewhat dated styling. The vehicle was sold in Mexico for many years, even after newer versions of the Sentra were available. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Summary**
The 2004 Nissan Tsuru, while generally reliable, can experience various issues related to its age. Engine issues such as rough idling and oil leaks are common, and transmission problems can range from minor shifting difficulties to major slipping. Suspension components wear out over time, affecting ride quality and handling. Electrical issues with sensors and the alternator are also possible. Rust is a major concern, especially in certain climates. Interior issues are fairly minor overall. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the severity of the problem and the mechanic's rates, but it is important to consider these potential expenses when evaluating a used 2004 Nissan Tsuru.
