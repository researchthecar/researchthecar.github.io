The 2010 Nissan Tsuru, while not sold in North America, was a popular sedan in Mexico and other Latin American countries.

Some models had a 4-speed automatic available. Owners generally appreciated its fuel efficiency and ease of maintenance. Common complaints revolved around its basic features, lack of modern safety equipment, and relatively low power output.
