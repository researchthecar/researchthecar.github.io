The 2002 Nissan Tsuru, primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries, is a compact sedan known for its simplicity, reliability, and affordability. It was offered with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine (GA16DE) producing around 105 horsepower and approximately 102 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission was the most common option, although an automatic transmission was also available. Owners generally appreciate its fuel efficiency, easy maintenance, and robust nature. However, it lacks modern safety features and can feel dated compared to newer vehicles. Complaints often revolve around its basic interior, lack of amenities, and limited safety equipment.
