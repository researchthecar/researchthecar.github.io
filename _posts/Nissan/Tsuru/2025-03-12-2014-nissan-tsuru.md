The 2014 Nissan Tsuru is a compact sedan primarily sold in Mexico. It's known for its simplicity, affordability, and reliability. The 2014 Tsuru is powered by a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing around 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. There is not another engine or transmission option offered. While it's appreciated for its fuel efficiency and low running costs, the Tsuru lacks modern safety features and is considered outdated in terms of design and technology. Common dislikes include the basic interior, limited features, and poor crash safety ratings.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke (indicating burning oil), and the need to add oil between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly, using higher viscosity oil, or potentially replacing piston rings or valve stem seals in more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the severity and the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter can fail prematurely, leading to reduced engine performance, a check engine light, and failure to pass emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch wear is a common issue, especially in vehicles used heavily in stop-and-go traffic. Symptoms include clutch slippage (engine revs without corresponding acceleration), difficulty shifting gears, and a high clutch pedal engagement point.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and potentially the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The shock absorbers and struts can wear out, especially given the age of the vehicle. This leads to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn shock absorbers and/or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (for all four corners)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bushings such as control arm bushings and sway bar bushings wear out over time, leading to clunking noises, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn bushings. Sometimes requires replacing the entire control arm.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may require replacement more frequently, especially in hot climates. Symptoms include slow engine cranking, difficulty starting, and a dead battery.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, leading to a loss of electrical power and potentially a stalled engine. Symptoms include dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard, and a battery that won't stay charged.

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can be a significant issue, especially in areas with high humidity or road salt usage. Rust can appear on the body panels, undercarriage, and around the wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Addressing rust early with rust converters, body filler, and paint. More extensive rust may require panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to prolonged sun exposure, the dashboard may crack.
