The 2005 Nissan Tsuru, a popular sedan particularly in Mexico and Latin America, is known for its simplicity, reliability, and affordability. The 2005 model primarily came with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine (GA16DE) producing around 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. It was generally paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. A 4-speed automatic transmission was also available, but less common. Many appreciate the Tsuru for its fuel efficiency, ease of maintenance, and durable construction. Common complaints often relate to its basic features, lack of modern safety equipment, and relatively simple interior.

**Summary**

The 2005 Nissan Tsuru is a reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it's prone to certain issues. Engine problems such as oil consumption and rough idling are common, as are transmission issues like difficulty shifting. Suspension wear and electrical faults can also occur. Rust can be a concern in certain climates. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the severity of the problem, but most fixes are relatively affordable compared to modern vehicles. The low initial cost and simple design of the Tsuru mean it is often cheaper to fix than other vehicles.
