**Summary**

The 2003 Nissan Tsuru is generally a reliable vehicle, but it is prone to some common issues due to its age and basic design. Engine-related problems like excessive oil consumption and idle air control valve malfunctions can be costly to address depending on the severity. Transmission issues, whether manual or automatic, can also lead to significant repair bills. Suspension wear is typical for a vehicle of this age, requiring replacement of shocks, struts, and bushings. Electrical problems, such as starter motor and alternator failures, are also common. Rust, particularly in regions with harsh climates, can be a significant concern. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine rebuilds or extensive rust repair, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common issues before purchasing.
