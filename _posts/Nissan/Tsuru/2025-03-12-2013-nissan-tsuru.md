The 2013 Nissan Tsuru, primarily sold in Mexico, is a no-frills, budget-friendly sedan known for its simplicity and reliability. It was largely unchanged from its earlier iterations. It typically came equipped with a 1.6-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. It was praised for its affordability, ease of maintenance, and fuel efficiency. However, it was often criticized for its lack of safety features and dated design. The standard transmission option was a 5-speed manual transmission. While it was not sold in the U.S. market, its reputation precedes it.

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop around the valve cover gasket and the rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket or the rear main seal.
