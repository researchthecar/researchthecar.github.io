The 2001 Nissan Tsuru, a popular sedan in Mexico and other Latin American countries, is known for its simplicity, reliability, and affordability. It was primarily offered with a 1.6-liter 16-valve DOHC inline-4 engine, known as the GA16DE, which produced approximately 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. The Tsuru was available with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Tsuru for its fuel efficiency, ease of maintenance, and durable construction.
