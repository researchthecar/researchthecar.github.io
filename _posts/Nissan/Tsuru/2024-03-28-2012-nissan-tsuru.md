**Introduction**

The 2012 Nissan Tsuru is a subcompact sedan that offers a budget-friendly option for basic transportation. It comes with a 1.6-liter engine and a 5-speed manual transmission, delivering 106 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. Despite its affordable price, the Tsuru has a spacious interior and a comfortable ride, making it a popular choice for families and budget-conscious drivers. However, it has received mixed reviews due to its lack of modern features and safety equipment.

**Engine**

**1.6L Engine**

* **Premature Engine Failure:** Some Tsurus have experienced premature engine failure due to excessive oil consumption and the resulting lack of lubrication. Symptoms include excessive blue smoke from the exhaust, loss of power, and knocking noises. The solution typically involves replacing the engine, which can cost upwards of $5,000.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to timing chain problems. This can cause the engine to misfire, run rough, or fail to start. Replacing the timing chain tensioner typically costs between $500 and $1,000.
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A leaking intake manifold gasket can cause a loss of power and a rough idle. Replacing the gasket typically costs between $200 and $500.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Grinding Gears:** Some Tsurus have reported grinding gears when shifting, especially in the cold weather. This issue can be caused by worn synchronizers or a worn clutch. Repairing or replacing these components typically costs between $300 and $1,000.
* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** A leaking transmission fluid seal or gasket can cause a loss of transmission fluid, leading to transmission damage. Replacing the seal or gasket typically costs between $200 and $500.

**Suspension**

* **Broken Front Coil Springs:** The front coil springs can break, causing the vehicle to sag and handle poorly. Replacing the coil springs typically costs between $200 and $400 per side.
* **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging:** The rear leaf springs can sag over time, leading to a loss of suspension performance. Replacing the leaf springs typically costs between $300 and $600 per axle.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, leading to a loss of electrical power. This can cause the vehicle to stall or leave the driver stranded. Replacing the alternator typically costs between $300 and $700.
* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely due to a parasitic drain. This can be caused by a faulty electrical component or a short circuit. Finding and fixing the source of the drain typically costs between $100 and $500.

**Exterior**

* **Tail Light Lens Cracking:** The tail light lenses can crack due to exposure to sunlight or impact. Replacing the tail lights typically costs between $100 and $250 per side.
* **Door Lock Malfunction:** The door locks can malfunction, making it difficult or impossible to open the doors. This can be caused by a faulty door lock actuator or a broken door lock linkage. Replacing the door lock actuator or linkage typically costs between $200 and $500.

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning System Failure:** The air conditioning system can fail, leading to a loss of cooling. This can be caused by a faulty compressor, a refrigerant leak, or a malfunctioning blower motor. Repairing or replacing the air conditioning system typically costs between $500 and $1,500.
* **Water Leaks:** The Tsuru can experience water leaks around the windows or sunroof. This can lead to interior water damage and mold growth. Repairing the leaks typically costs between $200 and $500.

**Summary**

Overall, the 2012 Nissan Tsuru is a reliable and affordable vehicle that offers basic transportation. However, it does have several potential issues, particularly related to the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but it is important to be aware of them before making a purchase decision.
