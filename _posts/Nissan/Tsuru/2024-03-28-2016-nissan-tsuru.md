**Summary:**

The 2016 Nissan Tsuru had a number of potential issues, particularly in the engine, suspension, and electrical components. While the engine and transmission were generally reliable, the timing chain tensioner failure could be a major concern. The suspension components were prone to premature wear, especially the lower control arm bushings and leaf springs. Electrical malfunctions, such as alternator and wiring harness issues, could also occur. Exterior concerns included headlight condensation and rust, while interior issues were primarily related to climate control and power window failures. The severity and cost of these issues could vary depending on the specific vehicle and its maintenance history.
