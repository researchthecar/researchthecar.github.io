**Introduction:**

The 2006 Nissan Tsuru is a compact sedan known for its affordability and reliability. It is powered by a 1.6-liter inline-four engine and comes standard with a 5-speed manual transmission. Additional transmission options include a 4-speed automatic and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Despite its low price point, the Tsuru offers a comfortable ride and surprisingly spacious interior. However, owners have reported several issues with the vehicle over the years, particularly with the engine and exterior components.

**Engine**

**1.6-liter Inline-Four**

* **Oil Leaks:** Excessive oil leaks around the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots on the ground and low oil levels on the dipstick. Solution: Replace the affected gaskets or seals. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Timing Chain Failure:** Premature failure of the timing chain, which can cause the engine to skip timing or even seize. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, reduced power, and an illuminated Check Engine light. Solution: Replace the timing chain and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Cylinder Head Gasket Failure:** Blown cylinder head gasket, causing coolant and oil to mix. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, overheating, and a rough idle. Solution: Replace the cylinder head gasket and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Shifting Difficulty:** Difficulty shifting gears, especially into reverse or first gear. Symptoms include grinding noises when shifting and difficulty engaging gears. Solution: Inspect and adjust the clutch, shift linkage, or transmission mounts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slippage:** Loss of power or slipping gears, especially during acceleration. Symptoms include a delayed response when shifting and a lack of acceleration power. Solution: Overhaul or replace the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

* **Hesitation and Jerking:** Hesitation and jerking during acceleration or deceleration. Symptoms include a lack of smoothness when shifting and a loss of power. Solution: Reprogram the CVT's control module or replace the CVT. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
