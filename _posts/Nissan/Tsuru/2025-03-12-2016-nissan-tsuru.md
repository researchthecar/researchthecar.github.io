The 2016 Nissan Tsuru is a compact sedan primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries. It was known for its simplicity, affordability, and durability, making it a popular choice for taxi fleets and budget-conscious buyers. The Tsuru was powered by a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing around 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic. While appreciated for its reliability and low running costs, the Tsuru lacked modern safety features and technology, which ultimately led to its discontinuation. Common dislikes included basic interior appointments and limited safety equipment.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners reported that their vehicles started consuming an excessive amount of engine oil. This could lead to the engine running low on oil, potentially causing damage if not monitored and addressed. Symptoms included needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Initially, monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed was a common practice. In severe cases, the issue might require engine repair or replacement of worn piston rings and valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experienced a rough or unstable engine idle, especially when the engine was cold. This could manifest as vibrations, stalling, or a generally uneven running condition.
    *   Solution: The issue could be caused by a dirty throttle body, faulty idle air control valve, or vacuum leaks. Cleaning the throttle body, replacing the idle air control valve, or addressing vacuum leaks were common solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**
*   **Hard Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some drivers reported difficulty shifting gears, especially into first or second gear. This could involve a feeling of resistance or grinding during shifts.
    *   Solution: Check the clutch cable for proper adjustment and lubrication. If the issue persists, inspect the clutch disc and pressure plate for wear or damage. In some cases, replacing the clutch assembly might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic**
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported harsh or abrupt shifts, especially between first and second gear. The transmission may also exhibit slipping or hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, perform a fluid change. In more severe cases, the issue could stem from worn or damaged internal components, requiring a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the Tsuru's extensive use as a taxi, suspension components such as shocks, struts, and bushings tended to wear out prematurely. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and unusual noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn shocks, struts, and bushings as needed to restore ride quality and handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows, if equipped, can suffer from window regulator failure. Symptoms included windows not moving up or down, slow or erratic movement, or clicking sounds from inside the door panel.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window regulator assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Tsuru was susceptible to rust, especially in areas with high humidity or road salt. Common rust locations included the wheel wells, rocker panels, and around the windshield and rear window seals.
    *   Solution: Rust repair could range from surface treatment to cutting out and welding in new metal sections. Regular washing and waxing can help prevent rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard material was prone to cracking and warping, particularly in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Dashboard repair or replacement. A dashboard cover could also conceal existing damage and prevent further cracking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Nissan Tsuru, while generally reliable, exhibited some common issues. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and rough idle could lead to moderate repair costs. Suspension and electrical problems like worn suspension components and faulty window regulators are also prevalent. Rust, a common issue in older vehicles, can be a significant concern. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these problems, especially signs of rust and engine issues. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but addressing these issues proactively can help maintain the Tsuru's functionality and longevity.
