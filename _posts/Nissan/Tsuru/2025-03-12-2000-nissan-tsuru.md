The 2000 Nissan Tsuru, a popular sedan in Mexico, was known for its reliability, affordability, and simplicity. The most common engine option was a 1.6L 16-valve DOHC inline 4-cylinder engine producing around 105 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options were available in other years and markets. The Tsuru was generally liked for its fuel efficiency, easy maintenance, and spacious interior for its class. Some common complaints revolved around its basic features, lack of modern safety equipment, and somewhat dated styling. It was primarily offered with a 5-speed manual transmission.

**Summary:**

The 2000 Nissan Tsuru is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any older car, it's prone to certain issues. The most common problems involve the engine (oil/coolant leaks, idling issues), transmission (shifting difficulties), suspension (worn components), and electrical system (starter/alternator failure). Rust can also be a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh weather. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely depending on the vehicle's condition and location, but generally, repairs are relatively affordable due to the car's simplicity and availability of parts.
