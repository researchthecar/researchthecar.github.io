The 2012 Nissan Tsuru, a sedan primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries, is known for its simplicity, affordability, and reliability. It typically came equipped with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing around 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. The engine was typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. While appreciated for its fuel efficiency and ease of maintenance, the Tsuru's basic features and lack of modern safety equipment are often cited as downsides. Some find the ride and handling adequate for daily use, while others criticize the spartan interior and limited features.
