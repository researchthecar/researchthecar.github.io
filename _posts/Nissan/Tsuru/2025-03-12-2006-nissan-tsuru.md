The 2006 Nissan Tsuru, primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries, is a simple, reliable, and affordable sedan known for its robust build and ease of maintenance. One of the most common engine options is the 1.6L 16-valve DOHC inline-4 gasoline engine, producing approximately 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. While appreciated for its fuel efficiency and practicality, the Tsuru is often criticized for its lack of modern safety features and basic amenities. Engine options include a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
