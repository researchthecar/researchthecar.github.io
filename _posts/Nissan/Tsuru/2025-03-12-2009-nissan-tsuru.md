The 2009 Nissan Tsuru is a compact sedan known for its simplicity, affordability, and reliability, particularly in regions like Mexico where it was a popular taxi vehicle. It typically came equipped with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. The engine options are only the 1.6L I4. Transmission options were limited to a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate its fuel efficiency and ease of maintenance. Common dislikes include its basic features, lack of modern safety equipment, and somewhat dated design.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil more frequently than normal, blue smoke from the exhaust (though not always present), and potentially fouled spark plugs.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels frequently and using a higher viscosity oil may provide a temporary solution. However, the long-term fix often involves replacing piston rings or, in severe cases, a complete engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the severity and chosen repair method)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rough Idling/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, and hesitation during acceleration can occur due to a variety of issues including a dirty throttle body, faulty mass airflow sensor (MAF), or vacuum leaks.
    * Solution: Cleaning the throttle body, replacing the MAF sensor (if faulty), and addressing any vacuum leaks. Diagnosing the underlying cause is essential.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the part needing replacement and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**
* **Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly first and second. This can be due to worn synchronizers or a worn clutch.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn synchronizers or clutch disc.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Due to the vehicle's age and mileage, common suspension issues include worn shocks/struts, ball joints, and bushings. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, excessive body roll, clunking noises from the suspension, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components. This may involve replacing shocks/struts, ball joints, control arm bushings, or tie rod ends.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the components replaced and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail over time, leading to a dead battery, dim headlights, and ultimately the inability to start the vehicle.
    * Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (depending on the brand and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sensors like the crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, and oxygen sensors can fail, leading to poor engine performance, check engine lights, and potentially difficulty starting the vehicle.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the specific faulty sensor and replacing it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the sensor and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust, especially in regions with high salt exposure (due to winter road treatment or coastal environments), can be a significant issue. Common areas for rust include the rocker panels, wheel wells, and undercarriage.
    * Solution: Addressing rust involves removing the rust, treating the metal, and applying rust-resistant coatings or paint. Severe cases may require welding in new metal panels.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the rust and the chosen repair method)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The dashboard material can become brittle and crack over time, especially in hot climates with high UV exposure.
    * Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on whether you replace it or cover it)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Nissan Tsuru, while generally reliable, is prone to certain issues due to its age and the environment it commonly operates in. The engine can experience oil consumption and idling issues. Suspension components wear over time, and electrical problems such as alternator and sensor failures are common. Rust can also be a significant concern, especially in regions with salt exposure. Interior issues like dashboard cracking are also frequently found. The severity and cost of repairs vary depending on the specific issue and extent of the damage, but preventative maintenance and addressing issues early can help mitigate these problems.
