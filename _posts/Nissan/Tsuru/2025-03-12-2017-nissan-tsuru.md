The 2017 Nissan Tsuru is a sedan primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries. It is known for its affordability, simplicity, and durability. The Tsuru is powered by a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing around 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. It is typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. While appreciated for its low cost and ease of maintenance, the Tsuru lacks modern safety features and is often criticized for its outdated design and limited comfort. The vehicle does not offer modern options, and it is not often that people will have strong opinions, good or bad, about the vehicle.
