The 2011 Nissan Tsuru is a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico. It's known for its simplicity, affordability, and reliability, which made it a popular choice for taxi fleets and budget-conscious buyers. The 2011 Tsuru is powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine (GA16DE) producing around 105 horsepower and 102 lb-ft of torque. This engine is typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. There is also a 4-speed automatic available. People often appreciate the Tsuru's fuel efficiency, ease of maintenance, and spacious interior for its class. On the other hand, it's criticized for its outdated design, lack of modern safety features (like airbags and ABS), and basic amenities.
