The 2022 Hyundai Creta Grand (also known as the Alcazar in some markets) is a three-row SUV based on the Creta. It offers a blend of practicality, comfort, and value. Engine options for the 2022 Creta Grand typically include a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated gasoline engine producing around 157 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5-liter diesel engine producing around 113 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are typically a 6-speed automatic for the gasoline engine and a 6-speed automatic or manual for the diesel engine. Owners generally praise the Creta Grand for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and feature-rich trim levels. Some common dislikes include the relatively modest performance of the engines, especially when fully loaded, and some concerns about the long-term reliability of certain components.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Gasoline Engine**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine hesitating or stalling, especially at low speeds or when accelerating from a stop. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: The specific cause can vary, ranging from a faulty mass airflow (MAF) sensor, a dirty throttle body, or issues with the fuel injectors. A diagnostic scan should be performed to identify any error codes. Cleaning the throttle body and replacing the MAF sensor are common starting points. In some cases, a software update to the engine control unit (ECU) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Check for oil leaks around the engine, especially around the valve cover gasket and oil pan. If no leaks are found, the issue could be with worn piston rings or valve seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help determine the extent of the wear. If internal engine components are worn, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L Diesel Engine**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) can become clogged, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and the DPF warning light illuminating on the dashboard. This is more common in vehicles primarily used for short trips at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Attempt a DPF regeneration by driving the vehicle at a sustained high speed (e.g., on a highway) for a period of time. If regeneration fails, a forced DPF regeneration can be performed by a mechanic using a diagnostic tool. In severe cases, the DPF may need to be cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and black smoke from the exhaust can be indicative of failing fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic scan should be performed to identify which injectors are malfunctioning. The injectors may need to be cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Gasoline Engine)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifts, especially between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A transmission fluid flush may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, it could be due to faulty solenoids or valve body issues within the transmission. In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may be available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Diesel Engine)**

*   **Slipping/Delayed Engagement**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues of the transmission not wanting to shift into gear or having trouble staying in gear. This can be more prevalent during low RPM driving.
    * Solution: A diagnostic scan should be performed to see if there are any internal transmission errors. A transmission fluid flush may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted excessive wear on suspension bushings, leading to clunking noises, especially when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect the suspension bushings for cracks or play. Replace worn bushings as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the infotainment system, such as freezing, crashing, or Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the infotainment system. Check for software updates. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., TPMS, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensors or parking sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor using a diagnostic tool and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from various areas of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or seats.
    *   Solution: Locate the source of the noise and tighten any loose fasteners. Apply felt tape or other sound-dampening material to areas where plastic panels are rubbing together.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: For vehicles equipped with the automatic tailgate option, the tailgate does not open/close when prompted or it only operates intermittently.
    * Solution: Check the battery voltage to ensure it is not too low. Perform diagnostic testing to check the motor assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Hyundai Creta Grand appears to have a mix of minor and more significant potential issues. Engine-related problems, such as hesitation, stalling, excessive oil consumption, and DPF issues, could lead to considerable repair costs, while electrical glitches and interior rattles may be less severe. Transmission problems could also be costly to repair. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection done by a trusted mechanic to assess the overall condition of the vehicle.
