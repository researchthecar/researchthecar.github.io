The 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport is a popular compact SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. Engine options include a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 delivering 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Santa Fe Sport's value proposition, ample cargo space, and comfortable seats. Common dislikes include occasionally sluggish acceleration with the base engine, and some reports of minor reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sudden stalling, especially at low speeds or when idling. Hesitation upon acceleration. Can be intermittent.
    * Solution: Software update to the ECU may help. In some cases, replacement of the throttle body or fuel injectors may be required. Diagnosing the issue involves checking for DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Codes) and inspecting relevant sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+ depending on the cause. Software updates may be free.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Failure due to connecting rod bearing wear.**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise that increases in volume, excessive engine noise, oil light, check engine light, and eventually engine failure. Often due to premature wear of the connecting rod bearing.
    * Solution: Full engine replacement. Some vehicles may be eligible for warranty extensions or recalls.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: 19V216000, 19V217000, 20V710000

**2.0L Turbo Inline-4**

* **Engine Knocking/Piston Slap**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable knocking sound, particularly during cold starts, which may be indicative of piston slap.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected piston and connecting rod may solve the issue. This is an invasive procedure.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engines)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky gear changes, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop. May also experience slipping or delayed engagement of gears.
    * Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, software updates to the TCM (Transmission Control Module) may be needed. In some cases, valve body replacement or full transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Noise/Clunking**

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or a dead battery, even when the vehicle is not in use.
    * Solution: Check for parasitic draws, which can be caused by faulty modules or accessories. A common culprit is the multimedia system or the Bluetooth module. Testing individual components with a multimeter can isolate the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (new battery) - $500+ (diagnostics and repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Blind Spot Detection Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Blind Spot Detection system intermittently failing or not working at all. Error messages displayed on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Check the sensors in the rear bumper for damage or obstruction. Diagnostic scan may be needed to identify the faulty sensor and wiring harness.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

While less frequent, transmission issues can also lead to significant repair bills. Other issues, such as suspension noises, electrical glitches, and sunroof malfunctions, are generally less severe but can still be frustrating for owners. Overall, while the Santa Fe Sport offers good value and features, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and ensure that any used vehicle has a well-documented maintenance history. Addressing the more serious problems can easily cost thousands of dollars, while the less severe issues range from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars to repair.
