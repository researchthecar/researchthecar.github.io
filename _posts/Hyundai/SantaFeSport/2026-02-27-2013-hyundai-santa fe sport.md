### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport generally demonstrates good reliability, particularly with the naturally aspirated 2.4L engine. The 2.0L turbocharged engine, while offering more power, has a higher propensity for issues like oil leaks and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, though not rampant, can manifest as hesitation or shuddering, often requiring fluid services or more involved repairs. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, are also noted. Suspension components like struts and shocks may require replacement as the vehicle ages. Overall, the Santa Fe Sport is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific concerns associated with the turbo engine and transmission.
