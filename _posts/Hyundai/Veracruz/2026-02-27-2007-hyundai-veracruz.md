### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Hyundai Veracruz generally demonstrates decent reliability, particularly in its exterior and interior components where no significant widespread issues are reported. The primary areas of concern tend to be the powertrain and electrical systems. Owners may encounter issues with the intake manifold gaskets and VVT solenoids on the 3.8L V6 engine, and the 6-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit fluid leaks or shifting problems. Electrical gremlins related to the Body Control Module and premature alternator failure are also noted.
