The 2012 Hyundai Veracruz is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and generous standard features. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.8-liter Lambda II V6 engine producing 260 horsepower and 257 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with an Aisin 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Veracruz for its quiet cabin, smooth ride quality, and value for the price. However, some common complaints include less-than-stellar fuel economy, a somewhat bland exterior styling, and a lack of more modern tech features compared to newer competitors.
