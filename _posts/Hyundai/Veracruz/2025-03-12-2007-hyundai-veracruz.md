The 2007 Hyundai Veracruz is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and value for the price. It was offered with a single engine option, the 3.8L Lambda V6, producing 263 horsepower and 257 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Veracruz for its smooth ride and quiet cabin, but common complaints include issues with the electrical system, specifically the TPMS and door lock actuators, and some concerns about fuel economy. Some owners dislike that it lacks some of the more advanced technology features found in competitors.
