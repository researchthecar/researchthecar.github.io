**Summary**

The 2008 Hyundai Veracruz is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some common issues. The most frequently cited problems relate to the suspension (rear shock absorbers, front strut mounts) and electrical components (battery drain, door lock actuators). Engine oil leaks and torque converter issues are also occasionally reported, although these tend to be less common. The severity of these issues varies. While some are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others, such as torque converter problems, can be more costly. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect the suspension, electrical system, and transmission for any signs of these common issues before purchasing a 2008 Hyundai Veracruz.
