Okay, I understand. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2003 Hyundai Elantra (XD chassis). *Note: Hyundai does not have a model named the HMD 260.* The 2003 Hyundai Elantra was available with a 2.0L inline-4 engine (G4GC) producing approximately 140 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Elantra for its affordability, fuel economy, and reliability for its time. Common complaints include road noise, basic interior materials, and relatively uninspired handling.

**Engine**

**2.0L G4GC Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.0L engine uses a timing belt, which requires replacement at specific intervals. Failure to replace the timing belt can result in the belt snapping, leading to significant engine damage (bent valves, damaged pistons). Symptoms include a ticking or slapping noise from the engine, difficulty starting, or complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt according to the manufacturer's recommended service interval (typically every 60,000 miles). It's often recommended to replace the water pump, tensioner, and idler pulleys at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (depending on labor rates and whether the water pump/tensioner are included)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, or erratic engine speed, especially when the engine is cold or at idle.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifts between gears, slipping during acceleration, or failure to engage a gear. This is often associated with fluid degradation or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement *may* resolve minor issues. For more severe problems, a transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush/filter: $150-$300. Rebuild: $2000-$4000. Replacement: $2500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, nose-diving during braking, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on parts quality and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Sway Bar Links/Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn sway bar links and/or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to go up or down properly, making grinding noises, or stopping altogether.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges not working correctly, flickering lights, or complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replacing the instrument cluster or repairing faulty connections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in Northern Climates)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the rocker panels, wheel wells, door panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement. This is highly dependent on the severity of the rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200+ (per panel, can easily reach several thousand for extensive rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or splitting of the dashboard material, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dashboard Cover: $50 - $150. Dashboard Replacement: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaching from the roof of the car and sagging down.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Hyundai Elantra, while generally reliable, exhibits common issues related to its age. Engine problems primarily stem from the timing belt needing regular replacement to avoid catastrophic engine damage. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, involve harsh shifting and slipping. Suspension components wear over time, leading to a compromised ride. Electrical problems like window regulator and instrument cluster failures are also common. Rust can be a significant concern, especially in areas with road salt. Interior issues mainly involve dashboard cracking and headliner sagging. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with engine and transmission repairs potentially being the most expensive. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and be prepared for age-related maintenance and repairs.
