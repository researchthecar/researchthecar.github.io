The 2002 Hyundai XG350 was a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and value for the money. It came equipped with a 3.5L V6 engine producing around 194 horsepower and 216 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated its spacious interior and smooth ride, but some common complaints revolved around reliability, particularly with electrical components and the automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (G6CU)**

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall, run rough, or experience difficulty starting. The check engine light may illuminate with a code related to the camshaft position sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the camshaft position sensor, a faulty crankshaft position sensor can cause stalling, starting problems, and a rough idle. A check engine light will likely appear.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front/rear crankshaft seals. Visible oil drips or stains under the car and a burning oil smell may be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, particularly when cold. Hesitation or delays during shifting.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. In some cases, valve body issues may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for fluid/filter change, $500 - $1500+ for valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs up without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. The transmission may hesitate to engage gears.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid change can help. However, transmission slipping often indicates internal damage requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+ for transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, nose-diving during braking, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per axle (front or rear), depending on the quality of the replacement parts and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken/Worn Sway Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or broken sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per link, depending on labor rates.

**Summary**

The 2002 Hyundai XG350, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, is prone to some common issues, particularly with the engine (sensor failures and oil leaks) and transmission (harsh shifting, slipping). Electrical problems and suspension wear are also reported. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, transmission problems can be costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
