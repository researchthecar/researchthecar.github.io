**Vehicle Introduction**

The 2004 Hyundai XG350 is a mid-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordable price. It was offered with a single engine and transmission option: a 3.5-liter V6 paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. The V6 engine delivers 200 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Despite its value-oriented positioning, the XG350 was praised for its smooth power delivery, responsive steering, and well-equipped cabin. However, it faced criticism for its lackluster fuel economy and uninspiring exterior design.
