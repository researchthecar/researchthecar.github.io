### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Hyundai XG350, while offering a comfortable and feature-rich experience for its time, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of vehicles of this age. The 3.5L V6 engine can be susceptible to timing belt issues if maintenance is neglected, and oil leaks are not uncommon. The automatic transmission may develop shifting problems over time. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also reported to wear out. Electrically, the Body Control Module can cause various gremlins, and alternators have a finite lifespan. Exteriorly, paint degradation and headlight hazing are aesthetic issues to watch for. Interiorly, HVAC blower motors and leather upholstery wear are the most frequently cited problems. Proactive maintenance, especially regarding the timing belt and fluid changes, is crucial for mitigating major issues.
