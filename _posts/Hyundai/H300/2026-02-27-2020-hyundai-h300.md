### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Hyundai H300 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly for its intended commercial use. The diesel engines, while generally robust, can experience issues like turbocharger problems or EGR valve clogging, especially with high mileage or inconsistent maintenance. The manual transmission's clutch is a wear item, and automatic transmissions may develop fluid leaks. Suspension bushings are a common point of wear in vehicles of this type. Electrical issues like battery drain are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in corrosive environments. Interiorly, the HVAC blower motor is a reported failure point. Despite these potential issues, the H300 remains a dependable workhorse when properly maintained.
