### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Hyundai H300 demonstrates good overall reliability, especially for its class. The diesel engines, while generally robust, can experience issues like turbocharger wear and glow plug problems, which are not uncommon for this type of powertrain. The manual transmission's clutch is a wear item, and automatic transmissions may develop fluid leak issues. Suspension components like bushings and ball joints are typical areas for wear. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, can occur. Exterior rust can be a concern in corrosive environments. Interiorly, the HVAC blower motor is a notable potential failure point. Despite these points, the H300 is considered a dependable workhorse when properly maintained.
