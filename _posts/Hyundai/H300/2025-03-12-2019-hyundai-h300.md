The Hyundai H300, also known as the Hyundai iLoad or Hyundai iMax in some markets, is a light commercial vehicle that offers versatility and practicality. The 2019 model typically comes with a 2.5-liter CRDi diesel engine, available in varying power outputs depending on the market (around 100 kW to 125 kW or 136 hp to 170 hp) and a torque figure between 343 Nm and 441 Nm (253 lb-ft to 325 lb-ft). It is typically available with a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission (depending on the market/engine configuration). Owners often appreciate its cargo capacity and maneuverability for urban environments, while some common dislikes include the basic interior features and ride quality compared to passenger vans.
