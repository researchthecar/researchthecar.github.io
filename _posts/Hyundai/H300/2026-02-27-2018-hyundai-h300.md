### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Hyundai H300 demonstrates good overall reliability, especially for its class. The diesel engines, while generally robust, can be susceptible to DPF-related issues and turbocharger problems, which are common in many modern diesel vehicles. The petrol engine and transmissions show fewer reported significant issues, with clutch wear on manuals and occasional fluid leaks on automatics being the most noted. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, are present but not excessively widespread. Interior components like the HVAC blower and door locks can occasionally fail. With regular maintenance, particularly for the diesel emissions system, the H300 is expected to provide dependable service.
