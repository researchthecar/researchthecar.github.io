Alright, here's the breakdown of common issues reported for the 2016 Hyundai H300, formatted as requested.

The 2016 Hyundai H300, also known in some markets as the iLoad or iMax, is a popular commercial van known for its practicality and spacious interior. The 2016 H300 is typically equipped with a 2.5-liter CRDi diesel engine, with options including different power outputs (around 136 hp and 343 Nm of torque, or 170 hp and 441 Nm of torque) and either a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the H300's cargo capacity and maneuverability in urban environments. Common criticisms include relatively basic interior features and ride quality compared to passenger vehicles.

**Engine**

**2.5L CRDi Diesel (136 hp/343 Nm & 170 hp/441 Nm)**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, engine misfires. Can be caused by contaminated fuel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty injectors, fuel system flush, and fuel filter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor costs).

    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of failure (oil lines, seals, compressor wheel damage). Replacement of the turbocharger unit is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, poor acceleration, check engine light. Carbon buildup can cause the EGR valve to stick open or closed.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve. In some cases, the EGR cooler may also need to be inspected/replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Summary**

The 2016 Hyundai H300, while a practical van, experiences common issues mostly surrounding the diesel engine, particularly injector and turbocharger problems, which can be costly. Transmission issues, depending on whether it's manual or automatic, range from clutch wear to rough shifting, potentially leading to significant repair expenses. Suspension and electrical problems are also common, requiring attention to maintain optimal performance. While some issues are minor and easily fixed, others can be quite severe and expensive, making a thorough inspection crucial before purchasing a used H300.
