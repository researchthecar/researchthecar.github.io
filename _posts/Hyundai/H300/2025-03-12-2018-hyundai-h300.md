The 2018 Hyundai H300, also known as the Hyundai iLoad or Hyundai iMax depending on the market, is a light commercial van often used for cargo or passenger transport. It typically comes with a 2.5L CRDi diesel engine, producing around 134-170 horsepower and 343-441 Nm of torque, depending on the specific tune and market. It's generally appreciated for its practicality, cargo space, and maneuverability in urban environments, but some owners have noted concerns about its ride quality, safety features (or lack thereof in some trims), and potential for certain mechanical issues. Transmission options are typically a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic (depending on region and engine variant), although some have a 6-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**2.5L CRDi Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, rough idling, poor fuel economy, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine knocking. Often diagnosed with a diagnostic scan revealing injector circuit faults.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per injector, plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**

**Summary**
The 2018 Hyundai H300 can be a reliable workhorse, but it's not without its potential issues. The most common complaints revolve around the engine (particularly injector and turbocharger issues in the diesel variants) and transmission (especially harsh shifting in the automatic). Suspension sagging and electrical problems can also occur. The severity and cost of repairs can vary greatly, from relatively inexpensive fixes like EGR valve cleaning to more substantial expenses like turbocharger or transmission replacements. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, paying close attention to engine performance, transmission behavior, and overall condition, and also obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic.
