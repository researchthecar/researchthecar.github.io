The 2022 Hyundai Elantra N is a high-performance compact sedan praised for its engaging driving dynamics, powerful engine, and relatively affordable price point. It comes exclusively with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 276 horsepower and 289 lb-ft of torque, and is offered with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners generally love the Elantra N's aggressive styling, sharp handling, and overall fun-to-drive factor. Common dislikes often revolve around the stiff ride quality, road noise, and sometimes polarizing design elements.
