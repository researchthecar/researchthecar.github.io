**Introduction:**

The 2022 Hyundai Elantra N is a compact sports sedan that is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, producing 276 horsepower and 289 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a six-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. The Elantra N is praised for its sporty handling, impressive performance, and well-equipped interior. However, it does have some reported issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

* **Knocking Sound:** Some owners have reported a knocking sound coming from the engine, particularly when the vehicle is cold. The issue is most likely caused by excessive piston-to-cylinder clearance, which can lead to premature engine wear. Replacing the engine components that are causing the knocking, such as pistons and rings, is the solution. Estimated cost: $5,000 - $8,000+
* **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption has been reported on some vehicles. This can be caused by worn piston rings, valve guides, or other internal engine components. Solving this requires engine disassembly and potential replacement of affected components. Estimated cost: $2,000 - $5,000+
* **Recalls:**

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Manual**

* **Grinding Noises:** A grinding noise when shifting gears has been reported by some owners. This is likely due to worn synchronizers, which can cause difficulty in engaging gears smoothly. Replacing the faulty synchronizers is the solution. Estimated cost: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Difficulty Shifting:** Hard or impossible gear shifts have been experienced by some drivers. This can be caused by a faulty clutch master cylinder, slave cylinder, or hydraulic lines. Replacing or repairing the affected components is necessary. Estimated cost: $500 - $2,000+
* **Recalls:** None Found

**Eight-Speed Dual-Clutch**

* **Shift Delays:** Owners have reported experiencing delays or hesitation when shifting gears. This can be caused by a software issue or faulty transmission components. A software update or transmission repair may be needed. Estimated cost: $1,000 - $3,000+
* **Clunking Noise:** A clunking noise when shifting or accelerating has been reported by some drivers. This can indicate a problem with the clutch packs or other internal transmission components. Replacing or repairing the affected components is the solution. Estimated cost: $2,000 - $5,000+
* **Recalls:** None Found

**Suspension**

* **Squeaky Noises:** Owners have reported a squeaking noise coming from the suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or rough roads. This is most likely caused by worn or damaged suspension components, such as bushings or sway bar links. Replacing the affected components is the solution. Estimated cost: $200 - $800+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Some owners have experienced a battery drain that can result in the vehicle not starting. This can be caused by a faulty electrical component, such as the alternator, battery, or parasitic drain. Diagnosis and repair of the affected component is necessary to resolve the issue. Estimated cost: $500 - $2,000+

**Exterior**

* **Weak Paint:** Flaking or peeling paint has been reported on some vehicles. This is most likely caused by improper paint application or exposure to harsh weather conditions. Repainting the affected areas is the solution. Estimated cost: $500 - $2,000+

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunctions:** Some owners have reported issues with the climate control system, such as poor cooling or heating, or incorrect temperature readings. This can be caused by faulty sensors, actuators, or control modules. Replacing or recalibrating the affected components is the solution. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,500+
* **Infotainment Issues:** Issues with the infotainment system, such as screen flickering, freezing, or connectivity problems, have been reported. A software update or replacement of the infotainment unit may be needed to fix these issues. Estimated cost: $500 - $2,000+

**Summary:**

The 2022 Hyundai Elantra N is a performance-oriented sedan with some reported issues that can be concerning for owners. The engine and transmission issues, in particular, can be costly to fix. While some of the issues are covered by recalls, others require out-of-pocket expenses. Overall, the severity and cost of the issues can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the extent of the repairs needed.
