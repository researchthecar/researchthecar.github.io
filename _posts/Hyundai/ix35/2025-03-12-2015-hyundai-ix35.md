The 2015 Hyundai ix35, also known as the Tucson in some markets, is a compact SUV that offered a blend of practicality, fuel efficiency, and value. Available engine options included a 2.0-liter Nu G4NA inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4-liter Theta II G4KE inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 182 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were generally paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the ix35 for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly features. However, some common criticisms included a somewhat uninspired driving experience and the quality of some interior materials.
