The 2013 Hyundai Equus is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and extensive features list, often at a more competitive price point than its European rivals. Two engine options were available: a 4.6L V8 producing 385 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque and a 5.0L V8 producing 429 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a Hyundai-built 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Equus for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and value proposition. Common complaints included the somewhat generic styling, less engaging driving dynamics compared to sportier competitors, and a lack of brand prestige relative to established luxury marques.

**Engine**
