### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Hyundai Equus offers a compelling luxury experience, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The V8 engine, while powerful, can be prone to coolant and oil leaks. The advanced 8-speed automatic transmission may exhibit shifting issues or leaks. The adaptive air suspension, a key luxury feature, is a notable area for potential costly repairs due to leaks or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and intermittent battery drain, are also reported. Exterior door handle mechanisms and interior headliner fabric can also present issues. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most common technical reliability concerns for this model year.
