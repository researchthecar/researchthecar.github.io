Here's a breakdown of the common issues and complaints associated with the 2011 Hyundai Equus, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration. The 2011 Hyundai Equus aimed to provide a luxury experience at a more accessible price point. It was available with two engine options: a 4.6L "Tau" V8 producing 385 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L "Tau" V8 producing 429 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Equus's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and extensive list of standard features. Common dislikes included the lack of brand recognition compared to established luxury marques, and occasional concerns about long-term reliability and parts availability.
