The 2015 Hyundai Equus is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and generous features list. It came standard with a 5.0L GDI V8 engine producing 429 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically praise the Equus for its smooth and quiet ride, luxurious appointments, and value proposition compared to European competitors. Common complaints often revolve around the car's somewhat bland styling, less engaging driving dynamics compared to sportier luxury sedans, and potentially higher maintenance costs due to its complex systems.

**Engine**

**5.0L GDI V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the oil consumption is crucial. Potential causes include worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or PCV valve issues. Repairs can range from replacing these components to more extensive engine work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the timing chain stretching or failing. Symptoms can include engine noise (rattling or ticking), rough running, check engine light with codes related to timing, and potentially engine damage if the chain breaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly when cold. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during gear changes has also been noted.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change *may* alleviate the issue. However, more serious cases might require valve body repair or replacement, or even a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $5000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Equus features an air suspension system designed for a smooth ride. However, air struts, compressors, or height sensors can fail, leading to a saggy ride height, uneven stance, warning lights on the dashboard, and a generally uncomfortable ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts, compressor, or height sensors. Sometimes, leaks in the air lines can also cause issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per strut, $500 - $1000+ for the compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the navigation or infotainment system are occasionally reported, including screen freezing, system crashes, inability to connect to Bluetooth, or malfunctioning GPS.
    *   Solution: Software updates *may* resolve some issues. However, hardware failures may necessitate replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software Updates) - $1500+ (Head Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain issues, leading to a dead battery after the car sits for a relatively short period.
    *   Solution: Identifying the parasitic drain requires diagnostic testing to pinpoint the faulty component. Potential culprits include modules not shutting down properly, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (Diagnostic Testing) + Cost of Repair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof can be a little finicky with the motor dying or getting stuck.
    *   Solution: Usually either have to replace the sunroof motor or track.

    * Description/Symptoms: The automatic door closing mechanism can sometimes have problems closing the doors properly.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the auto-closing module
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+

**Summary**

The 2015 Hyundai Equus, while a comfortable and luxurious sedan, can be prone to certain issues as it ages. The most concerning are potential engine problems like excessive oil consumption and timing chain issues, which can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical gremlins, along with transmission quirks, also contribute to the ownership experience. While not all Equus models will experience these issues, potential buyers should be aware of them and factor in potential maintenance costs when considering purchasing a used model. Severity of the issues varies, but certain engine or suspension failures can be very costly.
