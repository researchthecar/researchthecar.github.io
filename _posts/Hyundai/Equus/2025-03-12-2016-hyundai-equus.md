Here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2016 Hyundai Equus, separated by category and engine/transmission configuration, following your requested format.

The 2016 Hyundai Equus is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and a generous array of standard features. While it offered a premium experience at a more accessible price point than its European rivals, some owners have reported specific issues. The Equus was only offered with a 5.0L GDI V8 engine that produces 429 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with an A8LR1 8-speed automatic transmission. One common point of praise for the Equus is its smooth and quiet ride. Conversely, some owners found the styling to be too conservative and the infotainment system a bit dated compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**5.0L GDI V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include needing to add oil every few thousand miles or less and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust in severe cases.
    *   Solution: The first step is usually a thorough inspection for leaks. If no leaks are found, the dealer may perform an oil consumption test to determine the severity. Potential fixes can range from replacing the PCV valve to piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV valve) - $3,000+ (piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover gasket onto the engine. This can cause a burning smell and potentially lead to more serious issues if the oil drips onto hot exhaust components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**A8LR1 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed harsh or jerky shifting, especially during downshifts or at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or complete transmission overhaul might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (software update), $800 - $1500 (valve body), $3000 - $6000+ (transmission overhaul/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into drive or reverse and the transmission actually engaging.
    *   Solution: This could be due to low transmission fluid, a faulty solenoid, or internal transmission damage. A fluid flush, solenoid replacement, or transmission repair/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $300 - $800 (solenoid), $3000 - $6000+ (transmission overhaul/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Equus features an air suspension system for a smooth ride. Failures can manifest as one corner of the car being lower than the others, a rougher ride, or a warning light on the dashboard. The air compressor can also fail.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking for leaks in the air struts, lines, and compressor. Replacement of the faulty component is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500 per strut, $400 - $800 for compressor replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: A software update may fix the issue. In more severe cases, the entire head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update), $800 - $2000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, requiring frequent jumps or replacement.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly check the electrical system for parasitic draws. This can be caused by a faulty module, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the source of the draw; $100 - $300 (battery replacement), $200 - $1000+ (diagnosis and repair of parasitic draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Trunk Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic trunk may fail to open or close properly, or it may get stuck in an open or closed position.
    *   Solution: This can be caused by a faulty trunk latch, motor, or wiring issue. Replacement of the faulty component is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Power Seat Issues**
