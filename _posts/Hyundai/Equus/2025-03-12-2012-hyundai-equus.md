The 2012 Hyundai Equus is a full-size luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, spacious interior, and abundance of features. It came standard with a 4.6-liter V8 engine producing 385 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. In late 2011, Hyundai introduced the updated 5.0-liter GDI V8 with 429 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque, still mated to the six-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Equus for its value compared to other luxury brands, its quiet cabin, and comfortable seats. Common criticisms include a somewhat bland exterior styling, a less sporty driving experience than some rivals, and a lack of brand prestige compared to established luxury marques.
