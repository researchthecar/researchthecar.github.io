The 2014 Hyundai Equus is a full-size luxury sedan known for its opulent features and smooth ride. It came equipped with two engine options: a 3.8L Lambda GDI V6 producing 333 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L Tau GDI V8 generating 429 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an Aisin 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Equus's comfortable interior, quiet cabin, and extensive standard features. However, some criticisms include the understated exterior styling (blending in too much) and the lack of brand recognition compared to more established luxury brands.

**Summary**

The 2014 Hyundai Equus presents a mix of potential issues, primarily related to its complex suspension and electrical systems. The most significant concerns revolve around the air suspension, which can be costly to repair due to compressor and strut failures. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and battery drain are also common complaints. Engine and transmission issues appear less prevalent. While the Equus offers a luxurious experience, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance expenses, especially when considering higher-mileage examples.
