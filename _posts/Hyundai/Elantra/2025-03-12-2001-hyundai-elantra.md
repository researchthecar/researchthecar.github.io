The 2001 Hyundai Elantra is a compact car that was offered with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing around 140 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Elantra for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and decent handling. Common complaints included some build quality issues, relatively basic interior, and potential reliability concerns as the car aged.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (G4GC)**

*   **Check Engine Light Due to Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and diagnostic codes indicate a faulty oxygen sensor (O2 sensor). This can lead to decreased fuel economy and potentially affect emissions testing.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, often with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency. The car may fail emissions testing. Rattling noises from under the car are also common.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Temperature Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate temperature gauge readings, poor engine performance (rough idling, stalling), and potential overheating issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the coolant temperature sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeably rough or jerky shifting between gears, especially from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush, but if that doesn't solve the issue, it could indicate internal wear and require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) / $1500 - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs high but the car doesn't accelerate properly, indicating the transmission is slipping.
    *   Solution: Usually requires a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll in corners, and increased stopping distance.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken or Worn Stabilizer Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the stabilizer bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows fail to operate or move very slowly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may crank but not start, or stall intermittently while driving. The check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in Salt Belt Regions)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on body panels, particularly around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and door edges.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement (can be costly).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the severity. $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, often due to sun exposure and temperature changes.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or use of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (replacement) / $20 - $50 (cover)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Door Handles (Interior and Exterior)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door handles breaking or becoming loose, making it difficult to open the doors.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Hyundai Elantra, while affordable and reasonably efficient, can exhibit a range of issues as it ages. Engine problems mainly involve sensor and catalytic converter failures, while transmission problems center on shifting quality and slippage, particularly with the automatic. Suspension issues involve worn components like struts and stabilizer links. Electrical problems commonly involve window motors and the crankshaft position sensor. Rust can be a significant issue, especially in regions with harsh winters. Interior issues often include dashboard cracks and broken door handles. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing transmission or catalytic converter problems can be expensive. Regular maintenance and addressing minor problems promptly can help extend the life of the vehicle and prevent more costly repairs.
