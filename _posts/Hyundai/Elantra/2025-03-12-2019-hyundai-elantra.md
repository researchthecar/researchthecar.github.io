The 2019 Hyundai Elantra is a compact sedan known for its value, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Available engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, a 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 (Elantra Eco) producing 128 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 (Elantra Sport) producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0-liter engine is paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 1.4-liter turbo engine is paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The 1.6-liter turbo engine comes with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners appreciate the Elantra's user-friendly technology and spacious interior, but some dislike its somewhat uninspired styling and occasionally sluggish acceleration with the base engine.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights, engine knocking, and in severe cases, engine damage.
    *   Solution: Hyundai issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) regarding this issue. The solution involves performing an oil consumption test to determine the rate of oil consumption. If consumption exceeds a specified threshold, Hyundai may replace the engine under warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: This repair is typically covered under warranty if the vehicle meets the criteria for excessive oil consumption. Out of warranty, an engine replacement can cost several thousand dollars, depending on the source (new, remanufactured, used) and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   No Issues Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (paired with 2.0L engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or hesitation upon acceleration.
    *   Solution: Some cases can be resolved by reprogramming the transmission control module (TCM) with updated software. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection of the transmission is required, which might reveal worn components or valve body issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: A TCM reflash can cost around $100 - $200. More extensive repairs, such as valve body replacement, can range from $500 - $1500 or more.

*   **Clutch Slippage/Rough Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of clutch slippage, especially during low-speed maneuvers or uphill starts. Also, rough or jerky engagement of the clutch, making for an uneven driving experience.
    *   Solution: Updated software for the transmission control unit (TCU) may improve the situation. If the issue persists, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: TCU reflash, $100 - $200. Clutch replacement can range from $1500 - $3000, depending on labor costs and parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced premature failure of the rear shock absorbers, resulting in fluid leakage and diminished ride quality. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, poor handling, and visible fluid leaks on the shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty rear shock absorbers is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 for parts and labor, depending on whether you replace them individually or as a pair, and the brand of shock absorbers used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, even after short periods of inactivity. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: The cause of the battery drain needs to be diagnosed. This may involve testing the battery, alternator, and checking for parasitic draws caused by faulty modules or accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosing electrical issues can range from $100-$200. Battery replacement is around $150 - $300. Fixing a parasitic draw can vary widely, depending on the source, but could range from $200 to several hundred dollars if a module needs replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Updating the infotainment system software can sometimes resolve these issues. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates may be free at the dealership or cost a minimal fee. Head unit replacement can range from $500 - $1500 or more, depending on the specific system and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, causing condensation that can reduce visibility.

**Summary**

The 2019 Hyundai Elantra, while generally reliable, has a few common issues to be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption with the 2.0L engine, which can lead to costly repairs if not addressed promptly. Transmission issues, particularly with the DCT, are also a concern. Other issues, such as electrical problems and suspension component failures, are less common but still worth noting. Overall, while some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, major issues like engine or transmission replacements can be quite costly, highlighting the importance of regular maintenance and addressing any symptoms promptly.
