**Introduction:**

The 1994 Hyundai Elantra was a popular compact sedan offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 1.6-liter inline-four, while the optional engine was a 1.8-liter inline-four. Both engines were paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission. The Elantra was praised for its affordability, reliability, and fuel efficiency. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power and poor handling.
