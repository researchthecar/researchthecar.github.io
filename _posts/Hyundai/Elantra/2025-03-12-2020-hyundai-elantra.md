The 2020 Hyundai Elantra is a compact sedan known for its value, fuel efficiency, and user-friendly technology. Available engine options included a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine found in the Elantra Sport and GT models, producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Most Elantra models with the 2.0L engine are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 1.6L turbo engine is paired with a 7-speed dual clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praise the Elantra for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and generous warranty. Common complaints include the CVT's sometimes sluggish response and the overall uninspired driving experience with the base engine.
