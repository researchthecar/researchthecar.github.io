Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2022 Hyundai Elantra, organized by category and engine/transmission options.

The 2022 Hyundai Elantra is a popular compact car known for its stylish design, fuel efficiency, and value. Engine options include a 2.0L inline-4 producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, primarily found in the SE, SEL, and Limited trims, and a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 generating 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, specific to the Elantra N-Line. A hybrid powertrain combining a 1.6L engine with an electric motor is also available. Many owners appreciate the Elantra's modern interior, comprehensive safety features, and comfortable ride. However, some criticisms include the sometimes sluggish acceleration of the base engine and the absence of a physical volume knob on some trims.
