The 2004 Hyundai Elantra is a compact sedan known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It came with a single engine option, a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Elantra's practicality, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. However, common complaints often revolve around its somewhat underwhelming performance, susceptibility to rust, and some specific mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder (G4GC)**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt is a critical component that synchronizes the crankshaft and camshaft. Over time, it can wear and crack. If the timing belt breaks, especially on the 2.0L engine, it can lead to severe engine damage, including bent valves and damaged pistons. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, and eventually, a complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing belt, tensioner, and water pump is crucial preventative maintenance, ideally every 60,000 miles. If the belt breaks, the engine may need extensive repairs or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ (depending on the extent of damage if the belt breaks)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor helps the engine control module (ECM) determine the position of the crankshaft. A failing sensor can cause intermittent stalling, rough idling, and difficulty starting the engine.
    * Solution: Replacing the crankshaft position sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners may experience harsh or delayed shifting, especially between gears. Transmission slipping can also occur, where the engine revs up but the vehicle doesn't accelerate properly.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) / $1,500 - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the front strut mounts can lead to clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. This can affect handling and ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts. Often, it's recommended to replace the struts themselves at the same time for optimal performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (per pair, including struts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows may stop working intermittently or completely, often due to a faulty window motor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turn Signal Switch Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turn signal switch in the steering column can wear out, causing the turn signals to not engage properly or to cancel intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turn signal switch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$250
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2004 Elantra is known to be susceptible to rust, especially in areas with harsh winter climates that use road salt. Common areas for rust include the rocker panels, wheel wells, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair can range from surface treatment to panel replacement, depending on the severity. Prevention, such as regular washing and waxing, is helpful.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on severity and location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system. This can be due to a faulty sensor, wiring problem, or a problem with the airbag control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the system using a scan tool to identify the fault code, followed by repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Hyundai Elantra, while a practical and affordable car, does have several common issues owners should be aware of. The timing belt is a significant concern due to the potential for severe engine damage if it fails. Rust is also a prevalent issue, especially in colder climates. Electrical problems and suspension issues, while less catastrophic, can still be irritating and costly to repair. While these issues don't plague every 2004 Elantra, they are common enough to warrant careful inspection before purchasing a used model. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major engine or transmission work.
