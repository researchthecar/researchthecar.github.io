The 2023 Hyundai Elantra is a popular compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, stylish design, and comprehensive features at an affordable price point. Engine options for the 2023 Elantra include a 2.0L inline-4 (147 hp, 132 lb-ft torque), a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 (201 hp, 195 lb-ft torque) for the Elantra N-Line, and a 1.6L inline-4 paired with an electric motor for the Elantra Hybrid (139 hp combined). The 2.0L engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the N-Line gets either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The Elantra Hybrid uses a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. People generally appreciate the Elantra's modern styling, fuel economy, and user-friendly technology. Common complaints revolve around the performance of the CVT transmission in non-N-Line models and some reported issues with certain vehicle systems.
