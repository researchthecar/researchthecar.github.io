### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Hyundai Elantra is a generally dependable vehicle, particularly for its initial purchase price. However, owners should be aware of potential issues that can arise with age and mileage. Common concerns include engine oil leaks and the critical timing belt, which requires timely replacement to avoid catastrophic failure. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic variant, can lead to costly repairs. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also prone to wear. Electrically, the Body Control Module can cause a range of frustrating issues, and alternators may fail prematurely. Exteriorly, rust is a concern in certain climates, and headlight lenses can degrade. Inside, the HVAC blower motor and seat fabric durability are points to monitor. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to reported issues, the 2003 Elantra can remain a functional and economical mode of transportation.
