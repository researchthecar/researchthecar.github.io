The 2017 Hyundai Elantra is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and a long list of standard features for its price point. Owners often appreciate its comfortable ride and user-friendly technology. However, some common complaints include a somewhat uninspired driving experience and potential issues with certain components. Engine options for the 2017 Elantra include a 2.0L naturally aspirated inline-4, making around 147 hp and 132 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 making around 128 hp and 156 lb-ft of torque. The transmissions are either a 6-speed automatic or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic (DCT), depending on the engine and trim level.

**Engine**

**2.0L Nu MPI Inline-4 (147 hp, 132 lb-ft)**

*   **Engine Knocking/Ticking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a knocking or ticking noise coming from the engine, particularly at idle or during acceleration. This can be caused by worn connecting rod bearings.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is required. Replacement of the connecting rod bearings or, in severe cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported their 2.0L engines consuming more oil than expected between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil frequently.
    *   Solution: Hyundai has issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) for excessive oil consumption in certain engines. A compression test and leak-down test should be performed to identify the source of the oil consumption, which can be caused by piston ring failure. Depending on the diagnosis, the engine may require piston ring replacement or short block replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Kappa Turbo GDI Inline-4 (128 hp, 156 lb-ft)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature turbocharger failure. Symptoms include a loss of power, strange noises from the engine, and the "check engine" light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.0L engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is required. It may involve flushing the transmission fluid, replacing the transmission fluid, replacing solenoids, or a complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) (paired with 1.4L engine)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a common complaint with DCTs. The transmission may hesitate or jerk during low-speed maneuvers, such as stop-and-go traffic or parking. This is due to the nature of dual-clutch transmissions, which use two separate clutches for odd and even gears.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update from the dealership can improve the transmission's behavior. However, the underlying issue may still persist. Clutch replacement can be considered if the problem becomes severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that rear shock absorbers leak prematurely. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, poor handling, and visible fluid leaks on the shock absorbers.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the car, especially after it has been sitting for a while.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the source of the drain. Common causes include parasitic draws from aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator. Replacement of the battery, alternator, or repair of the wiring harness may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive.
    * Solution: A software update from the dealership or replacement of the unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation build-up inside the headlight housing. This can reduce visibility and potentially damage the headlight assembly.
    *   Solution: Some owners drill a small drain hole to allow moisture to escape, while others replace the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500

**Summary**

The 2017 Hyundai Elantra, while generally reliable, does have some reported issues. The severity and cost of these issues vary. Engine problems, such as knocking, ticking, and excessive oil consumption, can be quite expensive to fix. Transmission issues, particularly with the DCT, can be annoying, but software updates may mitigate some of the problems. Electrical issues and interior/exterior problems can also add to the cost of ownership. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchasing. The presence of these issues does not automatically mean a specific vehicle will experience them, but it's crucial to be informed and prepared.
