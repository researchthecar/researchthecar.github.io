### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Hyundai Elantra is a reasonably reliable vehicle, particularly for its price point. Common issues tend to be related to aging components such as oil leaks from seals, potential timing belt concerns, and wear in suspension parts like ball joints and tie rods. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Exterior paint and interior fabric wear are also noted. However, for owners who address these potential issues proactively, the Elantra can continue to provide dependable transportation. The manual transmission variant is generally considered more robust than the automatic.
