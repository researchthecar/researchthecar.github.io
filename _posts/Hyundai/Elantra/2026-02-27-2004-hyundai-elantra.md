### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Hyundai Elantra is a generally dependable compact car, particularly for its original purchase price. Key areas to monitor for potential issues include the engine's timing belt, which requires timely replacement to avoid catastrophic failure, and potential oil leaks from the valve cover gasket. Automatic transmissions may exhibit harsh shifting over time, necessitating fluid services or component repairs. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear out, leading to steering and noise issues. Electrical problems, often related to the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Exterior rust, especially in rust-prone climates, and interior wear on seats are common cosmetic and functional concerns. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and addressing problems promptly, the 2004 Elantra can remain a cost-effective vehicle.
