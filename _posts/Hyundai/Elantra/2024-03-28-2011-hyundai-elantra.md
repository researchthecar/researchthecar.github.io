**2011 Hyundai Elantra**

The 2011 Hyundai Elantra is a compact sedan that replaced the outgoing Elantra XD in 2006. It is offered with three engine options: a 1.6-liter Gamma four-cylinder, a 1.8-liter Nu four-cylinder, and a 2.0-liter Theta II four-cylinder. The 1.6-liter engine produces 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.8-liter engine produces 148 horsepower and 131 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0-liter engine produces 173 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. All three engines are mated to a six-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Elantra is a popular choice for budget-minded shoppers, and it offers a number of features that are typically found in more expensive cars. It has a spacious interior, a comfortable ride, and a good fuel economy. However, it also has some drawbacks, such as a lack of power from the base engine, a noisy cabin, and a cheap interior.
