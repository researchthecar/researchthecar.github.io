The 2007 Hyundai Elantra is a compact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and reliability, making it a popular choice for budget-conscious buyers. It came standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine, producing 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Elantra for its comfortable ride, spacious interior for its class, and good gas mileage. However, common complaints include a somewhat bland interior, a less-than-exciting driving experience, and some reported reliability issues as the car ages.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (G4GC)**

*   **Check Engine Light Due to Faulty Oxygen Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and a diagnostic scan reveals a code related to an oxygen sensor (typically P0133 or P0171). The engine may experience rough idling or reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light on (P0420 code), reduced engine performance, and a rattling sound from under the car. Often occurs due to a failing O2 sensor causing excess fuel into the catalytic converter.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, particularly noticeable between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush *may* help but replacement of the transmission or a rebuild is often the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $1,500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing or swaying in the rear, poor ride quality, and clunking noises from the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (for a pair)

**Summary**

The 2007 Hyundai Elantra, while generally reliable, exhibits some common issues as it ages. Engine-related problems, such as oxygen sensor and catalytic converter failures, and transmission issues like harsh shifting, are among the more costly concerns. Suspension wear, electrical glitches, and rust are also frequent complaints. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly is important for maintaining the vehicle's performance and safety. While the issues can range from minor annoyances to significant repairs, understanding these potential problems can help prospective buyers make informed decisions and prepare for potential maintenance costs.
