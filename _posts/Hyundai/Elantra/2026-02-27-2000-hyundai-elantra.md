### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Hyundai Elantra is a generally dependable vehicle, but like many cars of its era, it is susceptible to certain age-related issues. Common problems include oil leaks and timing belt concerns for the engine, clutch wear in manual transmissions, and potential for harsh shifting in automatics. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear out, and electrical issues such as alternator failure and power window motor problems are not uncommon. Exterior rust, particularly in wheel arches and rocker panels, is a concern for vehicles in humid or road-salt-prone climates. Interiorly, HVAC blower motor resistors and dashboard illumination can fail. Despite these potential issues, with regular maintenance and addressing problems promptly, the 2000 Elantra can remain a functional and economical car.
