**Introduction to the 2001 Hyundai Elantra**

The 2001 Hyundai Elantra is a compact sedan offered with a choice of two engine options: a 1.6-liter inline-four and a 1.8-liter inline-four. The 1.6-liter engine produces 105 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.8-liter engine generates 125 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a standard five-speed manual transmission, with a four-speed automatic transmission available as an option.
