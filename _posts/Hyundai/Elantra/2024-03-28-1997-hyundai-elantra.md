**Introduction:**

The 1997 Hyundai Elantra is a compact sedan that offers a reliable and fuel-efficient driving experience. It comes with a choice of two engine options: a 1.6-liter inline-four and a 2.0-liter inline-four. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 4-speed automatic transmission. The Elantra is praised for its affordability, interior space, and comfortable ride.
