**Introduction**

The 2014 Hyundai Veloster is a compact sporty coupe available with two engine options: a 1.6L 4-cylinder producing 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque or a turbocharged 1.6L 4-cylinder producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic for both engines.

While praised for its sporty handling, unique design, and affordable price, the Veloster has received some criticism for its limited rear seat space and lack of premium features.
