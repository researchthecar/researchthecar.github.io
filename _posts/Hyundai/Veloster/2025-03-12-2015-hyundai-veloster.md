The 2015 Hyundai Veloster is a unique, sporty hatchback known for its distinctive three-door design (one on the driver's side, two on the passenger's side). Engine options include a 1.6-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing around 132 horsepower and 120 lb-ft of torque. There's also a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers approximately 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque in the Veloster Turbo. Transmission choices include a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) depending on the engine. Drivers appreciate the Veloster's styling, fuel efficiency, and handling. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space and ride harshness, especially on models with larger wheels.
