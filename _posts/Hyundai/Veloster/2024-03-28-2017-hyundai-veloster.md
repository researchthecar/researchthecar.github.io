**2017 Hyundai Veloster**

The 2017 Hyundai Veloster is a compact hatchback available in three trims: Base, Turbo R-Spec, and Turbo. The base trim is powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 132 horsepower and 120 lb-ft of torque, while the Turbo R-Spec and Turbo trims feature a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. All trims are available with either a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission.

The Veloster is known for its stylish design, affordable price, and fun-to-drive handling. However, it has received some criticism for its cramped interior and lack of rear seat legroom.
