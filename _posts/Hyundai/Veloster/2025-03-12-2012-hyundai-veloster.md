The 2012 Hyundai Veloster is a unique and quirky three-door coupe known for its distinctive styling and affordable price point. The base engine is a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque. People often appreciate the Veloster's fuel efficiency, distinctive design, and long warranty. However, some common complaints include a lack of power from the base engine, a somewhat stiff ride, and limited rear visibility. It was offered with a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission.

**Engine**

**1.6L GDI 4-Cylinder**

*   **Engine Knocking/Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking or ticking noise coming from the engine, especially during cold starts or acceleration. This can be a symptom of various underlying issues, from oil starvation to worn rod bearings.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is critical. It may involve checking oil pressure, listening with a stethoscope, and potentially internal engine inspection. Depending on the cause, the repair could range from an oil change and engine flush to replacing rod bearings or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally large amount of oil between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and frequent oil top-offs.
    *   Solution: First, identify the source of consumption; possible causes include worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or leaks. Performing an oil consumption test to determine the rate of oil loss is crucial. Depending on the cause, the solution may be replacing seals, piston rings, or even the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illuminated check engine light (often with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency), reduced engine performance, and potentially a sulfur-like smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DCT transmission can exhibit hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during gear changes. Shifts may feel jerky or rough, especially at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: Start with a DCT transmission control module (TCM) software update, as Hyundai released updated software to address some of these issues. If the problem persists, the clutch actuator or the clutch itself may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure, where the vehicle is unable to shift gears or move. This can be caused by various internal component failures within the DCT.
    *   Solution: Typically, a full transmission replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Torsion Beam Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or during turns. Can also affect handling and stability.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear torsion beam bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Flickering Interior Lights**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent flickering or dimming of interior lights.
    * Solution: This issue is likely caused by a poor ground connection or a faulty dimmer switch. Replacing the dimmer switch or cleaning the ground connections may solve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Instrument Cluster**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Instrument cluster displaying incorrect information, flickering, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling, leaking, or getting stuck open/closed.
    * Solution: Depending on the problem, you may have to replace seals, lubricate, or even replace the whole sunroof assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates or vehicles frequently exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the dashboard. Repair may involve filling cracks and refinishing. Replacement is a more involved and costly option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Hyundai Veloster, while stylish and fuel-efficient, has some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with oil consumption and potential catalytic converter failure, can be costly. The DCT transmission is also a significant source of complaints and can be expensive to repair or replace. Suspension issues, like worn torsion beam bushings, are less severe but still require attention. Electrical issues are uncommon, but can still happen. The problems can range from minor annoyances to significant financial burdens, making a thorough inspection and maintenance history check important before purchasing a used 2012 Veloster.
