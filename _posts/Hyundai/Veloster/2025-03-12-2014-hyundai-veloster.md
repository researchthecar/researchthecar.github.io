Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2014 Hyundai Veloster, categorized by component and engine/transmission option where applicable. The 2014 Hyundai Veloster is a unique, quirky hatchback known for its three-door design (one door on the driver's side and two on the passenger's side). It was available with two engine options: a 1.6-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing around 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque (Veloster Turbo). Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. People generally liked the Veloster's distinctive styling and fuel efficiency, but some disliked its limited rear visibility and relatively small back seat. The base engine was also criticized for its lack of power.
