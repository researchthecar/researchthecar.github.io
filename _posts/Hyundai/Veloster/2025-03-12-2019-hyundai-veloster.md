Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2019 Hyundai Veloster, formatted for your website's needs.

The 2019 Hyundai Veloster is a unique compact car known for its asymmetrical three-door design (one door on the driver's side, two on the passenger side). It offers sporty handling and a distinctive look. What people love about the car is its unique styling and available performance. Common complaints center around ride quality and some reliability concerns. The 2019 Veloster has three engine options: a 2.0L naturally aspirated inline-4 cylinder that produces 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder that produces 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque (202 lb-ft w/ overboost), and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder (Veloster N) that produces 250 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (275 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque with Performance Package). Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic (available with the 2.0L engine), a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (available with the 1.6L turbo), and an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (available with the 2.0L turbo).

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Engine Knocking/Ticking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report a knocking or ticking noise, especially at idle or low RPMs. This can sometimes be related to the CVVT (Continuously Variable Valve Timing) system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the oil level, oil pressure, and inspecting the CVVT components. The CVVT actuator may need replacement, or in severe cases, the entire engine may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,500+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Loss of Power/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a loss of power, hesitation during acceleration, or rough idling. This can be attributed to faulty boost solenoids, vacuum leaks, or issues with the turbocharger itself.
    *   Solution: Troubleshooting involves checking for boost leaks, inspecting the turbocharger, and testing the boost solenoid. Replacing the faulty component typically resolves the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,500+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported oil leaks coming from the valve cover gasket.
    *   Solution: The solution is to replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 Cylinder (Veloster N)**

*   **Exhaust Pops/Bang Concerns**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Veloster N is programmed to produce pops and bangs in the exhaust, but some owners have reported concerns about excessive or inconsistent noises, sometimes accompanied by performance issues.
    *   Solution: This may be normal behavior, but a diagnostic check is recommended to rule out any exhaust leaks, sensor malfunctions, or fuel delivery issues. ECU tuning can be used to adjust the exhaust note and pop/bang characteristics.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,000+ depending on diagnosis and required repairs/tuning.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report harsh or jerky shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, or when downshifting. This can be related to low transmission fluid, faulty solenoids within the transmission, or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A transmission fluid flush may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body issues or solenoid replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **Shuddering/Jerking at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience shuddering, jerking, or hesitation during low-speed maneuvers, especially in stop-and-go traffic. This is a common characteristic of dual-clutch transmissions and can be exacerbated by wear on the clutch packs.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) software update may help improve shift quality. In some cases, clutch pack replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) - $2,000+ (for clutch replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can involve the touchscreen display, navigation, and audio functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer may resolve the issue. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $800+ (for head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Backup camera displays a black screen, is distorted, or not turning on.
    *   Solution: Check camera wiring, connection, and fuses. If the wiring is good, the camera needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Noises from Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard, particularly around the center console or air vents.
    *   Solution: This may require disassembly of the dashboard to locate and secure the source of the noise. Adding foam padding or tightening loose fasteners can help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Hyundai Veloster, while praised for its styling and performance, has some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues, particularly with knocking noises and potential oil leaks, should be investigated thoroughly. Transmission issues, especially with the DCT models, can lead to frustrating driving experiences at low speeds. Electrical glitches, such as infotainment problems, can also occur. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine or transmission repairs, can be costly. Overall, prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems.
