    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a mechanic is necessary to determine the exact cause. If connecting rod bearing failure is confirmed, engine replacement or a rebuild may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Loss of Power/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported experiencing a loss of power or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower RPMs. This can be due to issues with the turbocharger, wastegate, or boost control system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the turbocharger system for leaks or malfunctions. Replacement of faulty components like the wastegate actuator or boost pressure sensor may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (Veloster N)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some Veloster N owners have reported premature turbocharger failure, resulting in a significant loss of power, unusual noises from the engine, and potential check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit. Ensure the replacement unit is properly installed and that any related oil lines and filters are inspected for contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. Transmission slipping can also occur, resulting in delayed acceleration or a complete loss of power.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation, jerky engagement, or shuddering during initial acceleration from a standstill or at low speeds is a common complaint with this DCT. This is often attributed to clutch engagement issues.
    *   Solution: A software update may improve the clutch engagement strategy. In some cases, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 (software update) / $2,000 - $4,000+ (clutch replacement)
