Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2013 Hyundai Veloster, separated by category and specific engine/transmission configurations. The 2013 Hyundai Veloster is a unique, sporty hatchback known for its distinctive three-door design (one door on the driver's side, two on the passenger side). Engine options include a 1.6-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing around 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (Veloster Turbo) making approximately 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque.  People appreciate the Veloster's quirky styling and fuel efficiency. However, some common complaints include the base engine feeling underpowered, the ride can be stiff, and limited rear passenger headroom.

**Engine**

**1.6L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Engine Knocking/Piston Slap**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable knocking or slapping sound, especially during cold starts or acceleration. This can be due to excessive piston-to-cylinder wall clearance.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the pistons and/or connecting rods might be required. In more severe cases, a complete engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminating (often with P0420 code - Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold), reduced engine performance, and/or a sulfur-like smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling or whining noises from the turbocharger, check engine light, and/or oil leaks near the turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the turbocharger. Diagnosis of the oil supply line or other related components is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil levels despite regular oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause (e.g., piston rings, valve stem seals). Repair may involve replacing these components or, in severe cases, an engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage (engine revs higher than expected during acceleration), difficulty shifting gears, a burning smell, or a soft/spongy clutch pedal.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement (including pressure plate and throw-out bearing).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky gear changes, particularly between certain gears (e.g., 1st to 2nd, 2nd to 3rd).
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be needed to check for valve body issues or other internal damage. In some cases, transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid/filter), $500 - $2000+ (valve body/repairs), $3000 - $6000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling sounds coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn sway bar bushings, end links, or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Image is distorted, or screen will be black or not show up at all
    * Solution: Replace the backup camera
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuator is not properly working or does not work at all.
    * Solution: Replace the Door lock actuator
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+

*   **Delaminating Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard material starts to separate or peel away, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: There is no cost-effective repair. Most owners either live with it, try aftermarket dashboard covers, or (rarely) replace the entire dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1500+ (dashboard replacement is very labor-intensive)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Hyundai Veloster has a mix of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the turbo model and catalytic converters, can be the most expensive to address.  Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, are also relatively common and can range from simple fluid changes to costly repairs or replacements.  While other issues like suspension noises and electrical malfunctions are less severe, they can still be annoying.  Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's service history and condition before purchasing. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, so a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
