### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Hyundai Veloster generally presents a solid reliability record, particularly with its naturally aspirated engine and manual transmission. The turbocharged engine and the DCT automatic transmission have seen some isolated reports of minor performance quirks, such as slight lag or occasional hesitation, which are often addressable with software updates. Electrical components, specifically the infotainment system and, in rare cases, the battery, have also had a few documented issues. However, these are not widespread and do not detract significantly from the Veloster's overall dependability. For potential buyers, the Veloster offers a stylish and fun-to-drive experience with a good expectation of reliability, provided routine maintenance is followed.
