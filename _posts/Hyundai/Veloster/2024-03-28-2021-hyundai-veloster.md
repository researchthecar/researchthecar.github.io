**Introduction to the 2021 Hyundai Veloster**

The 2021 Hyundai Veloster is a compact hatchback coupe with a unique asymmetrical door design. It's available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The base engine produces 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, while the turbocharged engine generates 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT).

Critics praise the Veloster's sporty handling, spacious interior, and long list of standard features. However, they note that its rearward visibility is limited and its base engine is underpowered.
