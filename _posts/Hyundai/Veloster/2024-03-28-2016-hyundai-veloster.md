**Introduction**

The 2016 Hyundai Veloster is a compact sports car that comes in three trims: Base, Turbo, and Turbo R-Spec. It is powered by a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine that produces 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission. For the Turbo and Turbo R-Spec trims, a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine is available, producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.
