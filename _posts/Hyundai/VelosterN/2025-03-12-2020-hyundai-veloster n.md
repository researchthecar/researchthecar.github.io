The 2020 Hyundai Veloster N is a performance-oriented hatchback known for its sporty handling and distinctive asymmetrical design. It is only available with a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 275 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (with Performance Package). Initially, a six-speed manual transmission was the only option, but a new eight-speed wet dual-clutch transmission (DCT) was introduced for the 2020 model year. Owners appreciate its engaging driving experience, responsive engine, and relatively affordable price point. Common dislikes include a firm ride quality, road noise, and limited rear passenger space.
