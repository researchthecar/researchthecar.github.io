Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2019 Hyundai Veloster N, categorized by vehicle component. The 2019 Veloster N is a performance-oriented hatchback known for its engaging driving dynamics and affordability. It comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 250 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (or 275 horsepower with the Performance Package). A 6-speed manual transmission is the standard, but an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) was introduced later. Owners generally love the Veloster N's handling, exhaust note, and overall fun-to-drive factor. However, some dislike the firm ride, especially on rough roads, and the interior quality compared to more premium competitors.

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be noticed with lower oil pressure or the need to add a quart of oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection may be necessary to check for leaks, worn valve stem seals, or piston ring issues. In severe cases, engine repair or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Depending on the cause and severity, the cost can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major engine work.
    *   Recalls: None Found
