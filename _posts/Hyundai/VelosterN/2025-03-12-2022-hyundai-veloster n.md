The 2022 Hyundai Veloster N is a unique and sporty hatchback known for its performance-oriented features and engaging driving experience. It comes equipped with a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 275 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a standard 6-speed manual and an optional 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). People generally love the Veloster N for its sharp handling, potent engine, and relatively affordable price point. Common criticisms include a somewhat stiff ride, particularly on rough roads, and limited rear passenger space compared to more conventional hatchbacks.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (Theta II)**

*   **LSPI (Low-Speed Pre-Ignition)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or pinging noises from the engine, especially during low-speed acceleration. Can lead to engine damage over time.
    *   Solution: Using high-quality gasoline with the recommended octane rating and performing regular oil changes can help mitigate the risk. In some cases, a software update from Hyundai may be available to adjust engine parameters and reduce LSPI.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dependent on severity of the damage to the engine.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    *   Solution: A dealer inspection is required to determine the cause. Potential fixes range from replacing PCV valves to performing a cylinder leak-down test. If the engine is found to have excessive wear in the cylinders, pistons, or rings, an engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Ranging from $50 for the PCV valve to $5,000+ for engine replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and a high clutch engagement point. This is often due to aggressive driving habits.

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DCT may exhibit harsh or uneven shifts, particularly at low speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. Some owners report a shuddering sensation when accelerating from a standstill.
    *   Solution: A software update from Hyundai can sometimes address shifting issues. In more severe cases, clutch replacement or valve body repair may be required.
