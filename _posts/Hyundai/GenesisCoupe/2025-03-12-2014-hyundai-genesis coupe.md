The 2014 Hyundai Genesis Coupe is a rear-wheel-drive sports coupe known for its aggressive styling and engaging driving experience. It came with two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 274 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8-liter V6 generating 348 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Genesis Coupe for its sporty handling, powerful engines (especially the V6), and relatively affordable price point. However, some common complaints include a somewhat harsh ride, some cheap interior plastics, and concerns about long-term reliability.

**Summary**

The 2014 Hyundai Genesis Coupe can be a fun and rewarding vehicle to own, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger problems (2.0T), fuel injector issues (3.8L) are concerns, as are transmission issues, particularly with harsh shifting in the automatic and synchro wear in the manual. Suspension and electrical problems can also arise. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as turbocharger or transmission replacement, can be quite costly. Addressing these issues promptly can help prevent more significant problems down the road. Overall, owners should carefully inspect any used Genesis Coupe they are considering purchasing and be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with these known issues.
