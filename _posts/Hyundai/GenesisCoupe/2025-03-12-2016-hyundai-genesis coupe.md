The 2016 Hyundai Genesis Coupe is a rear-wheel-drive sports coupe known for its stylish design and performance-oriented driving experience. It was offered with two engine options: a 3.8-liter V6 producing 348 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 274 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The V6 engine was generally paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.0T engine could be had with a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Genesis Coupe's sporty handling, aggressive styling, and value for the performance. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated interior, firm ride, and average fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**

    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover gaskets, leading to oil burning smell, low oil levels, and visible oil residue on the engine.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The car might hesitate, stall, or experience reduced power. The check engine light will illuminate, and diagnostic codes related to the camshaft position sensor will be stored.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft position sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whining noise from the turbocharger, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
     * Description/Symptoms: Low oil levels between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust (especially during acceleration), and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
     * Solution: Can vary depending on the root cause. In some cases, piston rings or valve stem seals may need to be replaced. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
     * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the severity)
