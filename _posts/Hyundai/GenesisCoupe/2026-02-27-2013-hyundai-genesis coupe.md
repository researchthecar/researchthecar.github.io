### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe is generally a reliable sports car, particularly the 3.8L V6 model, which shows fewer reported mechanical issues. The 2.0L Turbo engine presents a higher likelihood of encountering turbocharger problems or increased oil consumption, which are common for turbocharged engines of this era. Transmission issues are more frequently reported with the 8-speed automatic, often manifesting as rough shifting, while the manual transmission's primary concern is typical clutch wear. Electrical gremlins, such as power window failures and infotainment glitches, are also noted but are not typically catastrophic. Overall, with proper maintenance and awareness of potential weak points, the Genesis Coupe can be a rewarding ownership experience.
