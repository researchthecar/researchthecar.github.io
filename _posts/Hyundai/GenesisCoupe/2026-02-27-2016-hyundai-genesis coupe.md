# 2016 Hyundai Genesis Coupe

### Overview

Generally, the Genesis Coupe is considered a reliable vehicle, with most reported issues being minor or related to typical usage. However, like any vehicle, there are specific areas that have seen more attention from owners and technicians, particularly concerning the powertrain and some electronic components. This analysis focuses on documented technical reliability concerns beyond routine maintenance.

### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Hyundai Genesis Coupe generally exhibits good reliability, especially with the 3.8L V6 engine. The 2.0L turbo engine has seen some reports of turbocharger issues and oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. Transmission reliability is decent, though clutch wear on manual transmissions and potential fluid leaks on automatics are noted. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are the most common non-powertrain complaints. Overall, for a sporty coupe, it offers a solid ownership experience, but potential buyers of the 2.0T model should be aware of the specific engine concerns.
