The 2011 Hyundai Genesis Coupe is a rear-wheel-drive sports coupe known for its stylish design and engaging driving experience. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 and a 3.8L V6. The 2.0T produces 210 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.8L V6 delivers 306 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque.
