The 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe is a rear-wheel-drive sports coupe known for its aggressive styling and engaging driving experience. It was available with two engine options: a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 274 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8-liter V6 generating 348 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Genesis Coupe's sporty handling and distinctive appearance.
