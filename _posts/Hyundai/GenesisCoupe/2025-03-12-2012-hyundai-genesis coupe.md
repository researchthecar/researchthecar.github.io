The 2012 Hyundai Genesis Coupe is a sporty rear-wheel-drive coupe known for its attractive styling and engaging driving experience. It offered two engine choices: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 274 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8-liter V6 generating 348 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's affordability, sporty handling, and distinctive design.
