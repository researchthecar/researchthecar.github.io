The 2010 Hyundai Genesis Coupe marked Hyundai's entry into the rear-wheel-drive sports coupe market. It came with two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing around 210 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque and a more potent 3.8L V6 generating approximately 306 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual (2.0T), a 6-speed manual (2.0T and 3.8L), a 5-speed automatic (2.0T), and a 6-speed automatic (3.8L). People often praised the Genesis Coupe for its sporty styling, rear-wheel-drive dynamics, and relatively affordable price point. Criticisms commonly included a somewhat harsh ride, interior materials quality, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary:**

The 2010 Hyundai Genesis Coupe, while praised for its sporty appeal and rear-wheel-drive setup, does exhibit some common issues. Engine issues range from turbocharger problems on the 2.0T to timing chain concerns on the 3.8L V6. Transmission problems are more prevalent on the automatic variants, with potential for slipping and harsh shifting. Suspension issues relate primarily to bushing and strut wear. Electrical issues, while less frequent, can be frustrating due to the BCM malfunctions. Interior issues are mainly cosmetic with cracked dashes, and other minor components failing. Generally, the severity of these issues varies, with some being relatively inexpensive to fix, while others, such as transmission or timing chain repairs, can be quite costly. Addressing these potential problems proactively can help ensure the longevity and enjoyment of owning a 2010 Genesis Coupe.
