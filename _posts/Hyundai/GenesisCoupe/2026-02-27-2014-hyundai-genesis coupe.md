The 3.8L V6 engine and the 8-speed automatic transmission are particularly robust, with no significant widespread issues reported. The 2.0L turbocharged engine, while offering better fuel economy and a lower entry price, has a few more documented concerns, primarily related to the turbocharger and potential oil consumption, which can be mitigated with proper maintenance.

Overall, the Genesis Coupe is a reliable choice in its segment, especially the V6 models, provided it has been maintained diligently.
