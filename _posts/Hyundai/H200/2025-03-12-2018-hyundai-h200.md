Okay, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2018 Hyundai H200, formatted as requested. Since information on the Hyundai H200 can be limited, I will aim to be comprehensive based on available data and user reports.
The 2018 Hyundai H200, also known in some markets as the Hyundai Starex, is a light commercial van known for its practicality and cargo space. It typically came with a 2.5-liter CRDi diesel engine. Horsepower and torque figures varied slightly depending on the specific tune but generally hovered around 134-170 hp and 253-311 lb-ft of torque. Available transmissions were usually a 5-speed manual or a 4/5-speed automatic (depending on the market). Owners often appreciate the H200 for its spacious interior and utilitarian design, making it suitable for various commercial and transportation needs. However, some common dislikes include its somewhat dated design compared to newer vans and concerns about long-term reliability, particularly with some diesel engine components.

**Engine**

**2.5L CRDi Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine misfires. Can lead to catalytic converter damage if left unresolved.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors with new or remanufactured units. Ensure proper coding of the new injectors to the engine control unit (ECU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (depending on number of injectors replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbo, loss of power, excessive oil consumption, and potential engine damage if the turbo fails completely.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for damage or wear. Replace the turbocharger if necessary. Ensure proper lubrication and maintenance of the turbocharger system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ (depending on turbocharger model and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, engine stalling, and increased emissions. The check engine light will likely illuminate.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. Inspect the EGR cooler and related hoses for blockages or leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on whether cleaning or replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, especially under load, increased engine RPM without a corresponding increase in speed, and a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and potentially the flywheel if it is damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Certain Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding noises when shifting, particularly into reverse or first gear. Difficulty engaging specific gears.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust the clutch cable or hydraulic system. Inspect the transmission linkage for wear or damage. If the problem persists, internal transmission repair may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for linkage adjustment, $1500+ for internal transmission repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4/5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts between gears, noticeable slipping during acceleration, and potential failure to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, internal transmission repair or replacement may be necessary. This could involve valve body issues or worn clutch packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush, $2000+ for transmission repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, particularly when driving over bumps. Reduced handling precision and stability.
