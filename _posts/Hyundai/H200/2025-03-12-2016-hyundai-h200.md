The 2016 Hyundai H200, also known as the Hyundai Starex or iLoad/iMax in some markets, is a light commercial van known for its practicality and spaciousness. The 2016 model year typically features a 2.5-liter CRDi diesel engine, available in multiple power outputs depending on the market (around 134-170 horsepower and 253-311 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options commonly include a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the H200's large cargo capacity and reliability for commercial use, but some dislike its basic interior and relatively unrefined driving experience.

**Engine**

**2.5L CRDi Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine misfires. This is usually caused by a buildup of carbon deposits on the injector nozzles, or by failure of the injector solenoid.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty injectors, often requiring specialized tools for removal. Cleaning the injectors may temporarily alleviate the issue, but replacement is often the permanent solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per injector (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the engine, reduced power, and a noticeable increase in fuel consumption. Oil leaks may also be visible around the turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit. Diagnosing the cause of the failure is crucial to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, engine light illuminated, and potential stalling. The EGR valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, preventing it from functioning correctly.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500 (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh gear changes, slipping between gears, and a general lack of responsiveness. Can be caused by worn clutch packs, solenoid failure, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission or rebuilding it. Replacing solenoids or performing a fluid flush can sometimes fix the issue if the damage is not severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,500+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower in the rear, reduced load-carrying capacity, and a harsh ride. Broken leaf springs are a safety concern.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ (including labor, per spring)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (including labor, per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Doors not locking or unlocking properly with the remote or central locking switch. Often related to faulty door lock actuators or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty door lock actuators or repair of damaged wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (per door)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a short period, requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair parasitic draws, which can be caused by faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or malfunctioning modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficult to open or close, sticking, or making grinding noises. This can be due to worn rollers, damaged tracks, or misaligned components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the door rollers and/or repairing the door track.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ (per door)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A/C blowing warm air or not working at all. Common causes include refrigerant leaks, compressor failure, or a faulty blower motor.
    *   Solution: Repairing refrigerant leaks, replacing the compressor or blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1200+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Hyundai H200 faces common issues, particularly relating to the 2.5L CRDi diesel engine (injector and turbocharger failures) and the 5-speed automatic transmission (rough shifting). Suspension and electrical gremlins also appear, though less frequently. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission work can be costly. Potential buyers should pay close attention to engine performance, transmission smoothness, and the condition of the suspension and door mechanisms during inspection. Due to the H200 being a popular commercial vehicle, proper maintenance is critical to avoid costly repairs.
