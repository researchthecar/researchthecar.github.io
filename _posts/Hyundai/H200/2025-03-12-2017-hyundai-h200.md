The 2017 Hyundai H200, also known in some markets as the Hyundai iLoad or Hyundai iMax, is a light commercial van known for its practicality and cargo capacity. The 2017 model typically came with a 2.5-liter CRDi diesel engine, available in different power outputs depending on the market. The engines deliver around 136 horsepower and 343 Nm of torque, or up to 170 horsepower and 441 Nm of torque for the higher output version. It was commonly available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its spacious interior, ease of driving, and reliability as a workhorse. However, some common complaints revolve around its basic features, ride comfort, and fuel economy compared to more modern vans.
