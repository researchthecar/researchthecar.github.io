Here is a comprehensive overview of common issues and complaints for the 2024 Hyundai Sonata, categorized by major components. The 2024 Hyundai Sonata offers a variety of trims, including those with a 2.5L GDI 4-cylinder engine (191 hp, 181 lb-ft torque), a 1.6L Turbo-GDI 4-cylinder engine (180 hp, 195 lb-ft torque) and a hybrid 2.0L GDI 4-cylinder with an electric motor (total system output 192 hp). The 2.5L engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L Turbo engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid uses a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Sonata's stylish design, comfortable ride, and extensive list of standard features. Common dislikes include the sometimes-unresponsive infotainment system and some find the engine performance to be adequate but not exhilarating.

**Engine**

**2.5L GDI 4-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between scheduled changes. Symptoms may include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Hyundai is currently investigating reports. The recommended solution currently involves closely monitoring oil levels and performing oil consumption tests at the dealership to establish a baseline. If consumption exceeds acceptable levels, engine repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies, $0 (for oil consumption test under warranty) to $3,000+ (for engine replacement out of warranty).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbo-GDI 4-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation upon acceleration or intermittent stalling, particularly in colder weather. The issue may be related to fuel delivery or sensor malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking fuel injectors, fuel pump, and related sensors (e.g., mass airflow sensor). Replacing faulty components is the recommended fix. Software updates for the ECU may also be available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (2.5L and 1.6L Turbo)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection of the transmission may be required, including checking fluid levels, valve body functionality, and clutch wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue) to $1,500+ (for valve body replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Hybrid)**

*No Issues Found*

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent freezing or crashing of the infotainment system, resulting in loss of navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset (often a small button or menu option). If the issue persists, a software update from the dealership is typically required. In rare cases, the infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $800+ (for infotainment unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Parking Sensors Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty front or rear parking sensors that give false warnings or fail to detect obstacles.
    *   Solution: First, ensure the sensors are clean and free from debris. If the problem persists, the sensors may need to be recalibrated or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Faulty Backup Camera**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The image being projected by the backup camera being extremely blurry.
    *   Solution: First, ensure the camera lens is clean and free from debris. If the problem persists, the camera may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per camera, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic High Beam Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Automatic High Beams can be unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Have the module replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing from Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners reporting rattling or buzzing sounds emanating from the dashboard area while driving, particularly on rough roads.
    *   Solution: This often requires pinpointing the source of the noise, which could be loose trim pieces, wiring harnesses, or other components behind the dashboard. Dealership technicians may need to disassemble parts of the dashboard to properly secure the offending components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof/moonroof either getting stuck open or stuck closed, or having a clicking sound.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks and seals can sometimes resolve sticking issues. If a motor or control module is defective, replacement is necessary. The clicking sound is usually a faulty switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (for lubrication) to $300 - $800+ (for motor/module replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*No Issues Found*

**Summary**

The 2024 Hyundai Sonata appears to have a mix of minor and potentially more significant issues. The most common complaints revolve around the engine (oil consumption, hesitation) and transmission (rough shifting), which, if unaddressed, could lead to more costly repairs down the line. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and sensors, also appear to be prevalent. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others like engine replacements can be substantial. The severity and cost of these issues depend greatly on whether the vehicle is still under warranty. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a trusted mechanic.
