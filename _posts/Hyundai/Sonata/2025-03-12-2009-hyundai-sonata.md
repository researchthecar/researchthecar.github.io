The 2009 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan known for its value, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 Theta II engine producing approximately 175 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 Lambda engine generating around 249 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners generally appreciate the Sonata's affordability and features for the price, but common complaints often revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the engine and electrical components.

**Engine**

**2.4L Theta II Inline-4**

*   **Engine Knocking/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine knocking or ticking noises, especially upon cold starts, can indicate connecting rod bearing failure. In severe cases, this can lead to complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the engine with a remanufactured or new unit is the most common solution. Some owners have had success with replacing the connecting rod bearings, but this is a less reliable long-term fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ for engine replacement.
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption is a common issue, requiring frequent oil top-offs between changes. This is often linked to piston ring issues.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a piston ring replacement can mitigate the issue, but engine replacement may be required for severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**3.3L Lambda V6**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic or harsh shifting between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. Slipping between gears can also occur.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may temporarily alleviate symptoms. However, the issue often stems from worn valve body components or internal damage, necessitating a valve body replacement or full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Sagging Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded.
    *   Solution: Replace worn shocks and springs. Some owners upgrade to heavy-duty springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks, often affecting individual doors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door.
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

*   **Turn Signal Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turn signals may not function properly or may flash rapidly.
    *   Solution: Typically replacing the flasher relay or the turn signal switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The latch that secures the center console lid breaks, preventing the console from closing properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the latch or the entire console lid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**Summary**

The 2009 Hyundai Sonata, while praised for its value and space, can suffer from reliability issues, particularly with the 2.4L engine and the 5-speed automatic transmission. Engine problems like knocking and oil consumption can be costly to repair, potentially requiring engine replacement. Electrical issues, such as door lock actuator failures, are also common. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs to the engine or transmission can be significant financial burdens. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, making a thorough inspection essential before purchasing a used 2009 Sonata.
