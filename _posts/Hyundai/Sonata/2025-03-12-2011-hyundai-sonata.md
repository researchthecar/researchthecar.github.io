The 2011 Hyundai Sonata was a popular mid-size sedan known for its stylish design and value. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 GDI engine producing approximately 198 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine with around 274 hp and 269 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciated the Sonata's spacious interior and fuel efficiency. However, common complaints included engine issues, particularly with the 2.4L engine, and some electrical problems.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 GDI**

*   **Engine Failure/Seizing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine failure is a common complaint, often occurring with little to no warning. Symptoms can include loud knocking, complete engine shutdown, oil consumption, and metal debris in the oil pan.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement is typically required. Hyundai extended the warranty on many of these engines due to a manufacturing defect that caused premature bearing wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: 172, 174

*   **Piston Slap**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Piston slap is an engine issue caused by excessive clearance between the piston and the cylinder wall. The symptom is a loud knocking sound when the engine is running, most noticeably when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, as well as slipping between gears, particularly at higher mileages. This can be accompanied by a check engine light and transmission-related error codes.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution may involve a transmission fluid flush, replacement of solenoids, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This is often attributed to worn sway bar links or bushings.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, causing the vehicle to not start. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This could involve replacing the battery, alternator, or other electrical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning TPMS Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors failing prematurely, resulting in inaccurate tire pressure readings or a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty TPMS sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Hyundai Sonata, while stylish and fuel-efficient, has some notable reliability concerns, particularly regarding the 2.4L engine. Engine failure is a severe and expensive issue, though Hyundai extended the warranty on many affected engines. Transmission issues and electrical problems are also present, potentially leading to further repair costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and inspect the vehicle thoroughly or obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic.
