The 2017 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan known for its value, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. The base engine is a 2.4-liter GDI 4-cylinder producing 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. An optional 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine provides a sportier experience with 245 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. A 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine is also available, producing 178 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. All engine options except the 2.0T engine are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.0T comes with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sonata's fuel efficiency, smooth ride, and user-friendly technology. Some common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling and occasional concerns about long-term reliability, particularly with certain engine components.

**Engine**

**2.4L GDI 4-Cylinder**

*   **Engine Failure Due to Connecting Rod Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine knocking, ticking, or rattling noises, especially on startup or during acceleration. Oil consumption may increase. Eventually, the engine may seize or fail completely. This issue is linked to debris left during manufacturing that block oil passages.
    *   Solution: Complete engine replacement. In some cases, a short block replacement may be sufficient if the cylinder head is undamaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: 19V026000, 19V588000, 20V740000, 23V753000

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle consumes an abnormal amount of oil between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and increased emissions.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the Engine Control Unit (ECU) can help to improve oil consumption. In more severe cases, replacement of piston rings or the entire engine may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500+ for ECU update; $2,000 - $5,000+ for piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder**

*   **No Issues Found**

**1.6L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L and 1.6L engines)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky gear changes, hesitation when shifting between gears, and potential slipping of the transmission.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid flush; $800 - $1,500+ for valve body replacement; $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.0T engine)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This can be caused by worn or damaged sway bar links, bushings, or shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected suspension components, such as sway bar links, bushings, or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve replacing a faulty module, relay, or wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or exhibit other issues, such as difficulty connecting to Bluetooth or unresponsive touch screen.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, the infotainment system may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update; $500 - $1,500+ for infotainment system replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing, leading to reduced visibility and potential damage to the headlight components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlight assembly, resealing the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per headlight.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Hyundai Sonata, while generally a reliable vehicle, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most concerning issue is the potential for engine failure in the 2.4L engine due to connecting rod bearing issues, which can be a costly repair. Excessive oil consumption is another common issue with the 2.4L engine. Other problems include transmission issues in models with the 6-speed automatic transmission, rear suspension noises, electrical issues with battery drain, and infotainment system malfunctions. Overall, while some of these issues can be minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, the potential for engine failure is a significant concern.
