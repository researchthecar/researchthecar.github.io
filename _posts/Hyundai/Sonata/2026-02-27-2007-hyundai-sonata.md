### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Hyundai Sonata presents a generally solid reliability record, particularly for its age and price point. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the 2.4L engine's oil consumption and timing chain tensioner, and potential transmission problems with the 5-speed automatic. Electrical components like the BCM and alternator can also be points of concern. However, many of these issues are repairable, and the costs are often moderate.
