The 2010 Hyundai Sonata marked a significant redesign for the model, aiming for a more stylish and fuel-efficient mid-size sedan. The standard engine was a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 175 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. A more powerful 3.5-liter V6 engine was also available, producing around 249 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque, exclusively paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Sonata's fuel economy, modern design, and spacious interior. Common complaints centered on issues with engine reliability, particularly oil consumption and potential engine failure in some models. Other concerns included electrical issues and some transmission problems.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, often requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be observed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Hyundai extended the warranty or offered a settlement related to excessive oil consumption. Depending on the severity, solutions range from oil consumption tests and software updates to piston ring replacement or complete engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (under warranty/settlement) - $3,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete engine failure due to connecting rod bearing failure. This often manifests as loud knocking noises from the engine, followed by a complete engine shutdown.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls:
        *   17V226000 (Affects certain 2011-2014 Sonatas; may be relevant depending on engine condition/replacement history)

**3.5L V6**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both 2.4L and 3.5L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission exhibits harsh or jerky shifting between gears. Slipping, where the engine revs without corresponding acceleration, can also occur.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is required to determine the root cause, which could range from low transmission fluid to valve body issues or internal damage. Solutions may include fluid replacement, valve body repair/replacement, or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (fluid change), $500 - $1,500 (valve body), $3,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn sway bar bushings, end links, and potentially rear shocks or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Airbag Warning Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to determine the specific fault code. Potential causes include a faulty clock spring in the steering wheel, seat position sensor issues, or airbag module problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intermittent Starting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car occasionally fails to start, even with a good battery.
    *   Solution: Check the starter motor, starter relay, and ignition switch. Faulty components should be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctions, including getting stuck open or closed, making unusual noises, or leaking.
    * Solution: Inspect and lubricate the sunroof tracks and mechanism. If the motor is faulty, it will need to be replaced. If the seal is worn, it will need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Driver's Seat Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electric driver's seat stops adjusting or moves intermittently.
    *   Solution: The seat motor needs replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing phones with the Bluetooth system, dropped calls, or poor audio quality.
    *   Solution: Start with attempting to re-pair the phone and check for software updates for the car's infotainment system. If the Bluetooth module is faulty, it may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $300+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Hyundai Sonata is generally considered a decent mid-size sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of several common issues. The most concerning is the potential for engine problems, particularly the 2.4L engine's tendency for excessive oil consumption and potential engine failure. Transmission issues, though less frequent, can also be costly. Electrical problems and suspension noises are less severe but still worth noting. The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic are highly recommended.
