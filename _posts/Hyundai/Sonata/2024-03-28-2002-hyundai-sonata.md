**Introduction**

The 2002 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan that was offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 2.4-liter inline-four that produced 138 horsepower and 157 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 3.0-liter V6 that produced 193 horsepower and 209 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.
