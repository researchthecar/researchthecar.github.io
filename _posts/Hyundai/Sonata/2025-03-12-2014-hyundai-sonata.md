The 2014 Hyundai Sonata can be a good value, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, especially those related to engine failure. The 2.4L and 2.0L turbo engines both have documented issues with failure due to rod bearing failure, which is an expensive repair. While some of these issues are covered by recalls, it's important to check the vehicle's history and ensure that all applicable recalls have been performed. Other issues, such as transmission harsh shifting and electrical problems, are generally less severe but can still be annoying and costly to repair.
