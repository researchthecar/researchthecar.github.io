### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Hyundai Sonata presents a mixed reliability profile. While it offers a generally comfortable ride and decent features for its age, potential owners should be aware of common issues. The 2.4L and 2.7L engines are susceptible to oil leaks and timing belt failures, which can be costly if not addressed proactively. Automatic transmission problems, such as harsh shifting, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, including window regulators and alternators, can arise. Exterior paint degradation and interior wear, particularly on seats and HVAC components, are also points to consider. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential problems are crucial for maintaining the Sonata's reliability.
