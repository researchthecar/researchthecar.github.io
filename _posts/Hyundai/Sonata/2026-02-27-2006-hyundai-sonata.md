# 2006 Hyundai Sonata

### Overview
The 2006 Hyundai Sonata, a mid-size sedan, offered a blend of value and features for its time. It came equipped with either a 2.4L inline-4 engine or a more powerful 3.3L V6, paired with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. While generally considered a decent option for budget-conscious buyers, like any vehicle of this age, it has specific areas where owners have reported issues. This analysis focuses on common mechanical and electrical problems, excluding routine maintenance, to provide a clearer picture of its long-term reliability.

## Engine

### 2.4L Inline-4
**Oil Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level.
- **Solution:** Replacement of seals and gaskets (e.g., valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket).
- **Cost:** $200 - $500

**Timing Belt Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Engine misfires, rough idling, potential engine damage if it breaks.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the timing belt, tensioner, and idler pulleys.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


### 3.3L V6
**Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Check Engine Light illumination, rough idling, stalling, difficulty starting.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the camshaft position sensor.
- **Cost:** $150 - $300

**Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**

- **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


## Transmission

### 4-Speed Automatic
**Slipping Gears**
- **Symptoms:** Delayed engagement, engine revving without acceleration, harsh shifting.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, or transmission rebuild/replacement.
- **Cost:** $300 - $2500+

**Transmission Control Module (TCM) Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Erratic shifting, 'limp mode' engagement, transmission warning light.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential replacement of the TCM.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


### 5-Speed Manual
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Clutch kit replacement (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $600 - $1000


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Ball Joints and Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, poor handling, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints and control arm bushings.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

**Strut Mount Bearing Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Popping or creaking noises when turning the steering wheel.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the strut mount bearings.

### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Hyundai Sonata presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core powertrain components are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues with oil leaks and timing belt maintenance on the 2.4L engine, and camshaft sensor/intake manifold issues on the 3.3L V6. Automatic transmission problems like slipping gears can be costly. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can arise. Exterior paint degradation and interior comfort system quirks are also noted. Despite these potential drawbacks, many issues are repairable, and the Sonata can still be a viable option if well-maintained and if common problems are addressed proactively.
