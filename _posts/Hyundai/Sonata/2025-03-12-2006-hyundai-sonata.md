The 2006 Hyundai Sonata was a significant redesign for Hyundai, aiming to offer a more refined and competitive mid-size sedan. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 162 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 engine producing around 235 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, although a 5-speed manual was available with the 2.4L engine. Owners generally appreciated the Sonata for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and value for money. Common dislikes included some perceived cheapness in interior materials and occasional reliability concerns, especially in earlier model years.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2.4L engines, particularly those produced in the early production years of this generation Sonata, exhibit excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings and potentially other internal engine components. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.3L V6 engine uses a timing belt that needs to be replaced at specified intervals (typically around 60,000-90,000 miles). Failure to replace the belt can lead to it breaking, causing significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Regular timing belt replacement, including the water pump and tensioner, is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be caused by worn valve body components or degraded transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear strut mounts can fail prematurely, leading to clunking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power window regulators can fail, causing the windows to stop working or move erratically.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators can fail, causing the doors to not lock or unlock properly with the key fob or interior switch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Quarter Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2006 Sonatas, especially those in regions with harsh winters and road salt, are prone to rust forming on the rear quarter panels, particularly around the wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, involving cutting out the affected area and welding in new metal, followed by paint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard material can be prone to cracking, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement (expensive) or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $1,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Hyundai Sonata, while offering a good value proposition, does have some common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the potential for oil consumption in the 2.4L engine and timing belt maintenance in the 3.3L engine. Other issues, such as suspension and electrical problems, are less severe but still common enough to warrant attention. Repair costs vary depending on the issue, with engine-related repairs potentially being the most expensive. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these issues and factor in potential maintenance costs when considering a purchase.
