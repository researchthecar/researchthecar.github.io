**Introduction**

The 1997 Hyundai Sonata was a midsize sedan offered with a range of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.0L inline-four with 130 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. A 2.5L V6 with 168 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque was also available. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Sonata was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordable price, but it was criticized for its lack of performance and dated design.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-Four**

* **Head gasket failure:** Premature failure of the head gasket, causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include overheating, coolant loss, and oil consumption. Requires replacement of the head gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Timing belt failure:** Premature failure of the timing belt, causing the engine to lose timing and potentially cause catastrophic damage. Symptoms include rough idling, loss of power, and engine stalling. Requires replacement of the timing belt and associated components. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Ignition coil failure:** Premature failure of the ignition coils, causing misfires and reduced engine performance. Symptoms include rough idling, engine hesitation, and reduced fuel economy. Requires replacement of the ignition coils. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+

**2.5L V6**

* **Engine overheating:** Premature failure of the water pump or thermostat, causing the engine to overheat. Symptoms include high engine temperature gauge, steam from the engine bay, and possible engine damage. Requires replacement of the water pump or thermostat. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Premature failure of the intake manifold gasket, causing vacuum leaks and reduced engine performance. Symptoms include rough idling, loss of power, and reduced fuel economy. Requires replacement of the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $600+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** Premature failure of the clutch disc or pressure plate, causing difficulty engaging gears or slipping gears. Symptoms include difficulty shifting, shuddering, or slipping while driving. Requires replacement of the clutch disc and pressure plate. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** Premature failure of the transmission fluid or torque converter, causing the transmission to slip gears. Symptoms include delayed or sudden gear engagement, loss of power, and rough shifting. Requires transmission repair or overhaul. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Shift solenoid failure:** Premature failure of the shift solenoids, causing the transmission to shift improperly. Symptoms include hard shifts, delayed shifts, or failure to shift gears. Requires replacement of the shift solenoids. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Summary**

The 1997 Hyundai Sonata is an affordable and spacious vehicle, but it has a number of potential mechanical and electrical issues. The most serious issues are head gasket failure, timing belt failure, and transmission slipping, which can all lead to costly repairs or even engine damage. Other issues, such as suspension noise, alternator failure, and interior leaks, while not as severe, can still be annoying and costly to fix. Overall, the Sonata's reliability and repair costs are average for the midsize sedan segment.
