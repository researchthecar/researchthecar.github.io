**Introduction**
The 2000 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan that was available with two engine and transmission options: a 2.4L inline-4 engine mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 3.0L V6 engine mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission. The 2.4L engine produces 138 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0L V6 produces 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally praise the Sonata's affordability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride, but complain about its lackluster performance and subpar fuel economy.

**Engine**
**2.4L Inline-4**
* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket, causing oil consumption and potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace valve cover gasket and clean affected areas.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Piston Ring Failure:** Worn or damaged piston rings can cause excessive oil consumption and blue smoke from the exhaust.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**
**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2000 Hyundai Sonata has several potential issues, particularly with its engine and transmission. Valve cover gasket leaks, piston ring failure, and transmission slipping are common problems with the 2.4L inline-4 engine and 4-speed automatic transmission, respectively. Additionally, the timing belt on the 3.0L V6 has a history of premature failure. Electrical problems, such as alternator and starter failures, are also not uncommon. Suspension, exterior, and interior issues are generally less severe and less expensive to address. Overall, the Sonata's reliability may vary depending on the specific engine and transmission combination, with the V6 and 5-speed automatic offering a better track record.
