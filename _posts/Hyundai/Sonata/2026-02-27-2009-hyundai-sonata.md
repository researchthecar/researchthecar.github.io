### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Hyundai Sonata is generally considered a reliable vehicle with a good value proposition. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to engine oil consumption and timing chain noise, particularly in the 2.4L and 3.3L engines. Automatic transmission issues like harsh shifting can occur and may require significant repair. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and premature alternator failure, are also noted.
