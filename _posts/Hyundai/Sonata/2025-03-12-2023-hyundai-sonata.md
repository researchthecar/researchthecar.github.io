The 2023 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and impressive technology features. It's offered with several engine options: a 2.5L GDI 4-cylinder engine (191 hp and 181 lb-ft of torque), a 1.6L Turbo-GDI 4-cylinder engine (180 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L GDI 4-cylinder hybrid engine (192 hp combined). A major draw to the Sonata is its user-friendly infotainment system and overall value. Some common criticisms include slightly uninspired handling compared to rivals and the polarizing design elements for some.

**Engine**

**2.5L GDI 4-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. The engine may also exhibit a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Initially, monitoring oil consumption to establish a baseline is recommended. If consumption exceeds manufacturer specifications, potential solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or in severe cases, the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Knocking/Ticking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report hearing a knocking or ticking noise coming from the engine, especially during cold starts or acceleration. This can sometimes indicate a potential issue with the connecting rod bearings or valvetrain components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking engine oil pressure, inspecting the valvetrain, and potentially disassembling the engine to examine the connecting rod bearings. Repair may involve replacing the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ (depending on the source and extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbo-GDI 4-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Hesitation/Stuttering During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing hesitation or stuttering, particularly during initial acceleration or when attempting to pass. This could be related to fuel delivery, turbocharger operation, or ignition system issues.
    *   Solution: The issue needs a diagnostic review, and it could require replacing the boost pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (Applies to 2.5L and 1.6L Turbo Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) reset or software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and refill may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Experiencing a delay when shifting from Park or Neutral into Drive or Reverse.
    *   Solution: Requires checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If low or contaminated, a fluid flush and refill are recommended. Internal transmission damage may require more extensive repairs or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $5,000+ (depending on the required solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or unexpectedly crash. This can impact navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Updating the infotainment system software to the latest version may resolve the issue. In some cases, resetting the system or replacing the head unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,500+ (depending on warranty coverage and required solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Sensors/Warning Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous warning lights on the dashboard, such as TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System), ABS (Anti-lock Braking System), or Check Engine Light. The cause can be due to faulty sensors that need replacing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor or addressing the underlying issue triggering the warning light.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the sensor type and location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report hearing rattling or squeaking noises coming from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces, especially when driving on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Requires locating and isolating the source of the noise. This can involve tightening loose fasteners, adding padding or shims, or replacing damaged trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AEB system can sometimes activate unnecessarily, causing the vehicle to brake suddenly even when there are no obstacles in the path.
    *   Solution: Recalibrating the AEB sensors or replacing them if faulty. Also, it is important to ensure that the sensors are free from debris and obstruction.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Hyundai Sonata exhibits a range of issues, from engine and transmission concerns to electrical and interior annoyances. While some problems like excessive oil consumption and harsh shifting could lead to significant repair costs, others such as infotainment glitches or interior rattles are less severe but still impact the overall ownership experience. Before buying, make sure to carefully test drive the vehicle, check the vehicle history, and have a mechanic inspect it for any potential problems.
