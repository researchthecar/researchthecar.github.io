The 2001 Hyundai Sonata was a mid-size sedan offering practicality and value. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing around 149 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L V6 producing around 170 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciated the Sonata's affordability, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Common complaints included subpar build quality, some reliability concerns, and uninspired handling.
