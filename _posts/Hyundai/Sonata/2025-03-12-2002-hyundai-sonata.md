The 2002 Hyundai Sonata was a mid-size sedan offering practical transportation and value. The 2002 model was part of the fourth generation (EF) Sonata. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 138 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L V6 engine producing approximately 170 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission (though the manual was less common). Owners often appreciated the Sonata's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordability. However, common complaints revolved around reliability, particularly with certain electrical components and the automatic transmission. Some also found the handling to be less engaging than competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Engine Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks often originate from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil spots on the ground, and a burning oil smell. Low oil levels can also be a sign.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail prematurely, resulting in a check engine light (typically code P0420). This can also cause poor fuel economy and decreased engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6 Cylinder**

*   **Timing Belt Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 is an interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, serious engine damage can occur. Symptoms of a worn timing belt include a ticking noise from the engine, rough idling, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing belt, tensioner, and water pump as a preventative measure. It is recommended to replace them every 60,000 miles.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.4L engine, the valve cover gaskets on the 2.7L V6 are prone to leaking. This can cause oil to drip onto the exhaust manifold, creating a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported issues with the 4-speed automatic transmission, including harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, and complete transmission failure. This is often linked to internal wear and tear or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can alleviate minor issues. However, more severe problems may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for fluid flush, $1500 - $3000+ for rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, resulting in shuddering during acceleration, stalling, or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**
No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks are prone to wear, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for all four.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coil springs can break, especially in areas with harsh winters and salted roads. Symptoms include a noticeable sag on one side of the vehicle, unusual noises, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken coil spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per spring.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows, particularly the driver's side, may stop working due to a faulty motor or switch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window motor or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks may stop functioning properly, either failing to lock or unlock. This is often due to a failing door lock actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator may fail, resulting in a dead battery, dim headlights, and a warning light on the dashboard.

**Summary**
The 2002 Hyundai Sonata, while offering value and space, has several potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the 4-speed automatic transmission, which is prone to failure and can be costly to repair or replace. Engine issues such as oil leaks and timing belt problems (for the V6) are also common. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in areas with salted roads. Electrical problems such as power window and door lock failures are also prevalent. Overall, the 2002 Sonata can be an affordable option, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and the cost to fix can vary significantly depending on the specific problem.
