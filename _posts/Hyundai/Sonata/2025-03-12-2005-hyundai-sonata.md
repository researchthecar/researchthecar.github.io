The 2005 Hyundai Sonata was a mid-size sedan offering a comfortable ride and good value for its price. It came with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 138 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 engine producing around 235 horsepower and 226 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, depending on the trim level and engine choice. Owners often praised the Sonata for its spacious interior, generous standard features, and smooth ride, but some criticized its bland styling and relatively unrefined engine compared to some competitors. Common complaints included issues with reliability, particularly regarding certain electrical components and engine-related problems.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present, indicating oil burning.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can help determine the source of the oil consumption. If the piston rings are worn or damaged, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises from the engine, especially on startup, can indicate a stretched or worn timing chain. This can lead to poor engine performance and, in severe cases, engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6 Engine**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush), $1,800 - $3,500 (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**

**Summary**

The 2005 Hyundai Sonata, while offering good value, exhibits several common issues. Engine-related problems, such as excessive oil consumption and timing chain concerns in the 2.4L engine, can be costly to address. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic transmission, can also lead to expensive repairs. Other problems such as suspension, electrical, and sunroof concerns can add to the overall cost of ownership. It is recommended to thoroughly inspect a used 2005 Sonata and address any known issues before purchase. The severity of the issues varies, but owners should be prepared for potential repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem.
