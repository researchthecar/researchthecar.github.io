The 2008 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and good value for the money. The Sonata was offered with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 162 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 engine producing around 234 horsepower and 226 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the Sonata for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and affordability. Common complaints include the car's somewhat bland styling, some reports of lower than expected fuel economy, and occasional reliability concerns, particularly with certain engine components.
