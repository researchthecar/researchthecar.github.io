The 2004 Hyundai Sonata was a mid-size sedan offered with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing around 138 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L V6 producing around 170 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners generally liked the Sonata for its affordability and spacious interior, but often disliked its unremarkable styling, lackluster handling, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.4L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing valve stem seals or piston rings may help reduce oil consumption. More severe cases might require a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.4L engine has a timing belt that needs to be replaced at regular intervals (typically around 60,000 miles). Failure to replace the timing belt can lead to it snapping, causing significant engine damage. Symptoms include engine misfires, rough running, or complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing belt according to the manufacturer's recommended service schedule, including replacing the water pump at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve cover gaskets on the 2.7L V6 can develop leaks over time. This results in oil leaking onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between gears. This can be caused by worn solenoids, low transmission fluid, or internal damage to the transmission.
    *   Solution: Start by checking and replacing the transmission fluid. If the problem persists, the solenoids may need replacement, or the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission Slipping is often caused by worn clutches or low fluid levels. The transmission may Rev high as though it is in neutral.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid and filter may help but often requires a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The strut mounts can wear out over time, leading to a clunking noise from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts. It is recommended to replace struts along with the mounts to ensure full functionality.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power window motors can fail, causing the windows to stop working or operate intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per window)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, leading to a dead battery, dimming headlights, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The undercarriage is prone to rusting, especially in regions with harsh winter climates.
    *   Solution: Applying rust prevention coating. In more severe cases, the rust may require cutting out the old and welding new metal in.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack over time, especially in vehicles exposed to high temperatures and sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard, applying a dashboard cover, or attempting to repair the cracks with a filler material.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inside door handles are known to break
    *   Solution: Replacing the inside door handle
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Hyundai Sonata, while affordable and spacious, is prone to certain issues. Engine-related problems, such as excessive oil consumption and timing belt failure (for the 2.4L), can be costly to address. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, may also require expensive repairs. Suspension and electrical issues, while generally less severe, can still contribute to the overall cost of ownership. The prevalence of rust, depending on the vehicle's location and history, can also be a concern. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
