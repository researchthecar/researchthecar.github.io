The 2019 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 producing 178 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 245 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a traditional automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sonata's value, fuel efficiency, and quiet cabin. Common dislikes include somewhat bland styling and a less engaging driving experience compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine stalling unexpectedly, particularly at low speeds or when idling. This can occur intermittently and without warning.
    *   Solution: The issue may be caused by a faulty Idle Air Control (IAC) valve, a dirty throttle body, or a failing crankshaft position sensor. Diagnosis is needed to pinpoint the exact cause. Replacing the faulty component or cleaning the throttle body may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted excessive oil consumption in these engines. This may be indicated by low oil levels between oil changes or the need to add oil frequently.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or a PCV valve issue. A compression test and leak-down test can help determine the source of the oil consumption. Depending on the diagnosis, solutions can range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive engine repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some drivers have experienced engine knocking or pinging sounds, especially under acceleration. This can be a sign of pre-ignition or detonation, which can damage the engine over time.
    *   Solution: The cause can range from using low-octane fuel to a faulty knock sensor or carbon buildup in the combustion chamber. Using premium fuel, replacing the knock sensor, or performing an engine cleaning may alleviate the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**All Transmissions**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting between gears. This may be more noticeable during upshifts or downshifts.
    *   Solution: This issue could be caused by low transmission fluid, a faulty shift solenoid, or wear within the transmission itself. A transmission fluid flush, replacing the shift solenoid, or a complete transmission rebuild may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: This noise could be caused by worn sway bar bushings, loose suspension components, or faulty shocks/struts. Inspecting and replacing the affected components can resolve the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced intermittent freezing or crashing of the infotainment system. This can interrupt navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: Try to use the factory update feature in the Infotainment settings to download the latest software, if it is not on the latest version. This is a common issue on vehicles and is usually fixed via over-the-air software update.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Free if software update resolves the issue. $100 - $1000+ if hardware is required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently. This can result in difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: There could be a parasitic drain from an electrical component that is not shutting off properly, a failing battery, or a faulty alternator. Testing the battery, alternator, and performing a parasitic draw test can help identify the source of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported condensation forming inside the headlight assemblies.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, removing the headlight assembly and drying it out or replacing the headlight assembly may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported problems with the sunroof, including difficulty opening or closing, unusual noises, or leaks.
    *   Solution: This issue could be caused by a faulty sunroof motor, damaged seals, or debris in the sunroof tracks. Cleaning and lubricating the tracks, replacing the motor, or replacing the seals may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Hyundai Sonata generally offers a reliable and comfortable driving experience. However, some owners have reported issues such as engine stalling, oil consumption, transmission harsh shifting, suspension noises, and electrical system glitches.
