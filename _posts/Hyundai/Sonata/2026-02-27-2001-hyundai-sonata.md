### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Hyundai Sonata presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core structure and basic operation are generally sound, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the V6 engine's head gaskets and the automatic transmission's tendency for harsh shifting or slipping. Electrical components like the alternator and window regulators are also common failure points. Exterior paint and interior wear are typical for its age. Addressing these known issues proactively can help mitigate unexpected repair costs and ensure a more dependable ownership experience. Regular maintenance, especially fluid changes for the transmission, is highly recommended.
