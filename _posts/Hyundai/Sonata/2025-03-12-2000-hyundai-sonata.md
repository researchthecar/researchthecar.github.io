The 2000 Hyundai Sonata was a mid-size sedan that offered a comfortable ride and decent value. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing around 149 horsepower and 143 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L V6 engine producing around 170 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual, but the automatic was much more common. Owners often liked the Sonata for its affordability and spacious interior, but disliked its bland styling and sometimes unreliable performance.
