The 2007 Hyundai Sonata was a popular mid-size sedan known for its affordability and spacious interior. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 162 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 engine producing approximately 235 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.3L V6 came standard with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Sonata's comfortable ride and generous features for its price point. Common dislikes included the somewhat uninspired styling and potential reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Some owners noticed blue smoke from the exhaust, indicating burning oil.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions ranged from using a thicker oil to replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. In severe cases, engine replacement was necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light - P0011 (Camshaft Position Timing Over-Advanced or System Performance)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, often accompanied by rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and potential loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft position sensor or the variable valve timing (VVT) solenoid. In some cases, the timing chain or related components needed replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, engine stalling, or complete engine failure. As a maintenance item, the timing belt is supposed to be replaced at certain mileage intervals. However, failure to replace it can lead to catastrophic damage.
    * Solution: Timing belt replacement with associated components like water pump and tensioners. If failure occurred, engine repair or replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.4L Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed gear changes, slipping between gears, and general transmission unresponsiveness.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change might help in minor cases. More severe cases required valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (Paired with 3.3L Engine)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or vibrating sensation, particularly at lower speeds or during light acceleration. This is often attributed to torque converter clutch failure.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush with fluid specifically formulated for torque converter shudder or replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps. The rear strut mounts can deteriorate and crack.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear strut mounts and potentially the struts themselves, if damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows, requiring multiple attempts to operate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Airbag Light On**
    * Description/Symptoms: Airbag light is on due to a faulty clock spring, seat belt sensors, or other faulty components.
    * Solution: Scan the airbag system with a scan tool to diagnose the fault code. Once the fault code is identified, replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues (Certain Regions)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the undercarriage, wheel wells, and other body panels, especially in areas with heavy road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, which can range from surface treatment to panel replacement depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard material, often in sun-exposed areas.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or use of a dashboard cover to conceal the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2007 Hyundai Sonata presented a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the 2.4L, can be a significant concern, potentially leading to costly repairs. Transmission issues, while less common, also warrant attention. Suspension and electrical problems are more typical for a vehicle of this age and mileage. Rust can be a serious problem in colder climates. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission work can be costly, making it crucial to thoroughly inspect the car before purchase.
