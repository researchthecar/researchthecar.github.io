### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Hyundai Sonata is a reasonably reliable vehicle, particularly for its price point. The most common significant issues tend to revolve around the engine's timing belt (especially on the 2.5L V6), potential oil leaks from gaskets, and automatic transmission problems like slipping or harsh shifting. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical concerns such as alternator failure and window regulators are also noted.
