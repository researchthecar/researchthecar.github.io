The 2016 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan that offered a blend of value, comfort, and fuel efficiency. It came with several engine options, including a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 cylinder engine (185 hp, 178 lb-ft of torque), a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine (178 hp, 195 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine (245 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque). The 2.4L engine was generally paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L and 2.0L turbo engines also used a 6-speed automatic or a 7-speed dual clutch transmission depending on trim level. Owners often praised the Sonata for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and long warranty. Common complaints included concerns about engine reliability, particularly the 2.4L engine, and some issues with the infotainment system.

**Summary**

The 2016 Hyundai Sonata, while generally a reliable vehicle, does have some common issues to be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for engine failure in the 2.4L GDI engine, which can be a very costly repair if not covered by a warranty or recall. Other issues, such as suspension noise and infotainment system problems, are generally less severe and expensive to address. When considering purchasing a 2016 Sonata, it's crucial to check the vehicle's maintenance history, including any applicable recalls, and to have a mechanic inspect the engine for signs of potential problems.
