The 2015 Hyundai Sonata marked a significant redesign for the model, offering a more refined and mature aesthetic. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 GDI engine producing 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque and a 2.0L Turbocharged inline-4 GDI engine producing 245 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Common praises for the 2015 Sonata include its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong value proposition. However, some drivers have expressed dissatisfaction with the base engine's performance and reported various reliability concerns.
