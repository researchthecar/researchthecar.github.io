- **Cost:** $200 - $400

**Timing Belt Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Sudden engine stalling, rough running, engine misfires, no-start condition.
- **Solution:** Replacement of timing belt, tensioner, and idler pulleys. If failure occurred, potential engine damage may require more extensive repairs.
- **Cost:** $500 - $800 (preventative), $1500+ (if engine damage)


## Transmission

### 4-Speed Automatic (F4A51)
**Harsh Shifting / Slipping**
- **Symptoms:** Jerking or clunking during gear changes, engine revs without acceleration, difficulty engaging gears.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or full transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600 (fluid/filter), $500 - $1000 (solenoids), $1800 - $3500 (rebuild)


### 5-Speed Manual
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Clutch kit replacement (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $600 - $1000


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Strut Mount Bearing Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Popping or creaking noise when turning the steering wheel, especially at low speeds.
- **Solution:** Replacement of strut mount bearings.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Gremlins**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows malfunctioning, interior lights not working, door locks acting erratically, dashboard warning lights illuminating without cause.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Hyundai Sonata presents a mixed reliability profile. Owners should be particularly mindful of potential issues with the timing belt on both engine options, as failure can be catastrophic and costly. Oil leaks are also a common concern, especially as the vehicle ages. For the automatic transmission, be prepared for potential shifting problems or solenoid failures. On the suspension front, worn ball joints and tie rod ends are typical for a vehicle of this age and mileage. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and alternator failures are also documented. Exteriorly, rust can be a significant issue depending on climate. While not a perfect vehicle, addressing these common problems proactively can help maintain the Sonata's functionality and value.
