The 2022 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and generous features. Engine options include a 2.5L naturally aspirated inline-4, a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4, and a 2.5L hybrid powertrain. The 2.5L engine produces 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. People generally like the Sonata's modern styling, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. Some common dislikes include the occasionally unrefined engine noise, and the somewhat numb steering feel.

**Engine**

**2.5L GDI Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine stalling or hesitating, particularly during initial acceleration or when coming to a stop. This can be intermittent and may not always trigger a diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking for vacuum leaks, faulty mass airflow sensor, issues with the fuel system (fuel pump, fuel filter, fuel injectors), and updating the engine control unit (ECU) software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption in 1.6L turbocharged engines.
    *   Solution: Hyundai has acknowledged potential issues with piston rings in some of these engines and may recommend a compression test and/or oil consumption test. Repairs could range from replacing piston rings to a complete engine replacement depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Associated with 2.5L Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, especially between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during cold starts or when the transmission is under load.
    *   Solution: Involves software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) or replacement of faulty solenoids within the transmission. Transmission fluid change may also be recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (Associated with 1.6L Engine)**

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported delays when shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking transmission fluid levels, solenoids, and the transmission control module. A software update or, in more severe cases, transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: The issue is often related to worn or loose rear suspension components such as sway bar links, bushings, or shocks. Replacement of the affected components is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive, requiring a system reset.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, hardware replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (hardware replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic draws (something is drawing current when the car is off). Replacing the battery and/or addressing the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic High Beam Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic high beam system may not function correctly, failing to dim or brighten the headlights as expected.
    *   Solution: Recalibrating or replacing the sensor for the automatic high beam system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or buzzing noise coming from within the dashboard area, particularly on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying and securing the source of the rattle, which may involve adding insulation or tightening loose components behind the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2022 Hyundai Sonata generally presents a good value proposition, but some owners have experienced issues with the engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and interior. Engine and transmission issues appear to be more prevalent, particularly with the 1.6L Turbo engine and its associated transmission. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly, with some issues being resolved by software updates while others require more extensive and costly component replacements. While no major widespread recalls have been issued, potential buyers should be aware of these reported issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
