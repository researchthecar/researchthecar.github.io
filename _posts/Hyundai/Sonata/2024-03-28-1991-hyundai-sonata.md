**1991 Hyundai Sonata**

The 1991 Hyundai Sonata was a compact sedan that offered a budget-friendly option for car buyers. It came with a choice of two engine options: a 1.6L I4 and a 2.0L I4. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. While the Sonata was praised for its affordability and fuel efficiency, it also received criticism for its lack of power and interior quality.

**Engine**

**1.6L I4**

* **Blown head gasket:** Warping of the head gasket due to overheating or age. Symptoms include coolant leaks, white smoke from the exhaust, and overheating. Fix involves replacing the head gasket. Cost: $500 - $1000
* **Timing chain failure:** The timing chain may stretch or break, causing the engine to lose timing and potentially resulting in catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, decreased performance, and misfires. Fix involves replacing the timing chain and related components. Cost: $1000 - $2000+
* **Oil pan gasket leak:** A leaking oil pan gasket can cause oil loss and potential engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms include an oil leak underneath the vehicle and low oil levels. Fix involves replacing the oil pan gasket. Cost: $150 - $400

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual**

* **Synchronizer wear:** Worn synchronizers can make it difficult to shift gears, especially when downshifting. Symptoms include grinding or difficulty engaging certain gears. Fix involves rebuilding the transmission or replacing the affected synchronizers. Cost: $500 - $1200

**4-speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip or fail to engage properly. Symptoms include a lack of power or acceleration, hesitation when shifting, and a burning smell. Fix involves repairing or replacing the transmission. Cost: $1000 - $2500+
