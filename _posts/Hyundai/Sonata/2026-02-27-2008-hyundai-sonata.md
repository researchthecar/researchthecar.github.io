### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Hyundai Sonata presents a mixed reliability profile. While the chassis and exterior components generally hold up well, potential owners should be aware of possible issues with the 2.4L and 3.3L engines, particularly concerning oil consumption and timing chain noise. The automatic transmissions, especially the 5-speed, can also experience problems like harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM faults and alternator failures, are not uncommon. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Sonatas provide reliable service if properly maintained. Addressing issues like oil consumption proactively is crucial for engine longevity. Overall, it's a vehicle that requires informed ownership and attention to its specific weak points.
