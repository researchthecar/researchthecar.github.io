**1990 Hyundai Sonata**

The 1990 Hyundai Sonata was a compact sedan that offered two engine options: a 1.6-liter inline-four and a 2.0-liter inline-four. Both engines were paired with a five-speed manual transmission. The Sonata was praised for its affordability, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power and poor handling.

**Engine**

**1.6-liter Inline-Four**

* **Blown head gasket:** This is a common issue on the 1.6-liter engine. Symptoms include overheating, coolant leaks, and white smoke from the exhaust. The solution is to replace the head gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Oil leaks:** The 1.6-liter engine is known to develop oil leaks from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots under the car and a burning oil smell. The solution is to replace the leaking gaskets or seals. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+

**2.0-liter Inline-Four**

* **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt is a critical component that synchronizes the timing of the engine's valves. If the timing belt fails, it can cause catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a loud noise from the engine, engine misfires, and a loss of power. The solution is to replace the timing belt and any damaged components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket is a seal that prevents air from leaking into the engine's intake manifold. If the gasket fails, it can cause a loss of power, rough idling, and increased emissions. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400+

**Transmission**

**Five-Speed Manual**

* **Difficulty shifting gears:** This issue can be caused by worn synchros or a faulty clutch master cylinder. Symptoms include difficulty engaging gears, grinding noises when shifting, and a spongy clutch pedal. The solution is to replace the worn components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $800+
* **Transmission fluid leaks:** Transmission fluid leaks can occur from the input shaft seal, output shaft seal, or pan gasket. Symptoms include low transmission fluid levels, slipping gears, and a burning smell. The solution is to replace the leaking seal or gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+

**Suspension**

* **Worn strut mounts:** The strut mounts are rubber isolators that connect the struts to the car's body. When they wear out, they can cause a clunking noise when driving over bumps. The solution is to replace the worn strut mounts. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400+
* **Leaking shocks:** The shocks are responsible for damping the suspension. If they leak, they can cause a loss of stability and a bouncy ride. The solution is to replace the leaking shocks. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $600+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator is responsible for charging the battery. If it fails, the battery will not be able to provide power to the electrical system. Symptoms include dim headlights, a dead battery, and a warning light on the dashboard. The solution is to replace the alternator. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $500+
* **Starter failure:** The starter is responsible for starting the engine. If it fails, the engine will not be able to turn over. Symptoms include a clicking noise when turning the key and a dead engine. The solution is to replace the starter. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400+

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** The 1990 Sonata is prone to rusting, especially around the wheel arches, fenders, and undercarriage. Symptoms include bubbles or flaking paint and holes in the metal. The solution is to repair the rust or replace the affected panels. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $2,000+
* **Sunroof leaks:** The sunroof is known to leak on some Sonatas. Symptoms include water stains on the headliner and carpets. The solution is to replace the sunroof seal or adjust the sunroof alignment. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+

**Interior**

* **Power window failure:** The power window motors or switches can fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. Symptoms include difficulty raising or lowering the windows and a burning smell. The solution is to replace the faulty motor or switch. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+
* **Climate control failure:** The climate control system can fail, causing the heater or air conditioner to malfunction. Symptoms include a lack of heat or cooling, strange noises, and a flashing or dim display. The solution is to replace the failed component. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $800+

**Summary**

The 1990 Hyundai Sonata is a budget-friendly sedan with some serious reliability issues. The engine is prone to head gasket and timing belt failures, while the transmission can develop shifting problems and leaks. The suspension and electrical systems are also known to have issues. Rust is a common problem on the exterior, and the interior can suffer from power window and climate control failures. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but overall, the 1990 Sonata is not a reliable vehicle.
