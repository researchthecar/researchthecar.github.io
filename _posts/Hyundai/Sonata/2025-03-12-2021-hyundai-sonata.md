The 2021 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and abundant features. Engine options include a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, a 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 180 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L inline 4-cylinder hybrid engine with a combined power output of 192 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque. All non-hybrid models use an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid models use a 6-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the Sonata for its value, fuel economy, and spacious interior. Common criticisms include the somewhat numb steering feel and the occasionally quirky behavior of some of the advanced driver-assistance systems.

**Summary:**

The 2021 Hyundai Sonata presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine and transmission problems, while not universally reported, can be costly, particularly with the 2.5L engine and the 8-speed transmission. Electrical issues, especially related to the infotainment system, are fairly common but typically less expensive to resolve. Other issues such as sunroof malfunctions and interior rattles can be annoying but are usually less severe. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase, considering an extended warranty for added peace of mind.
