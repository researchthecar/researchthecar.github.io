The 2012 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan known for its sleek styling, spacious interior, and strong fuel economy. Engine options for the 2012 Sonata included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 198 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine producing 274 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Sonata's value proposition, comfortable ride, and modern design. However, some common complaints revolve around engine reliability, particularly concerning oil consumption and potential engine failure.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, sometimes requiring a quart or more between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and illuminated check engine light.
    *   Solution: Hyundai extended the warranty on some 2011-2019 Sonatas to address this issue. The repair often involves a software update, and if that doesn't resolve the issue, piston ring replacement or engine replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $4,000+ depending on warranty coverage and required repair.
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

*   **Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Catastrophic engine failure, often attributed to connecting rod bearing failure, leading to a seized engine. This may be preceded by knocking noises.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual noises from the turbocharger (whining, screeching), and potential for check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.4L engine, owners report excessive oil consumption leading to potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Similar to the 2.4L, Hyundai has issued recalls and warranties for this issue. The repair often involves a software update, and if that doesn't resolve the issue, piston ring replacement or engine replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $4,000+ depending on warranty coverage and required repair.
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifting between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. The transmission may hesitate before engaging a gear.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, valve body replacement or transmission replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,500+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revving without corresponding acceleration, indicating the transmission is not properly engaging the gears.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is needed to determine the cause, which could be low fluid, worn clutch packs, or internal damage. Repair options range from fluid flush and filter replacement to complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,500+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension components, such as stabilizer bar links, bushings, or shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component.
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a short period, making it difficult to start the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair parasitic drain caused by faulty electrical components or wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause of the drain.
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to lock or unlock properly, requiring manual operation.
    *   Solution: Door lock actuator replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2012 Hyundai Sonata can be a good value but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly concerning the engine. Oil consumption and engine failures are significant concerns, and while Hyundai has addressed some of these issues with extended warranties, it's crucial to check the vehicle's history and perform a thorough inspection before purchasing. Other issues, such as transmission problems and electrical faults, can also lead to unexpected repair costs. While some repairs may be relatively inexpensive, engine or transmission replacements can be costly, making it essential to factor in these potential expenses when evaluating the overall cost of ownership.
