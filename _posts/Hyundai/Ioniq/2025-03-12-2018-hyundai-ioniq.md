The 2018 Hyundai Ioniq is a compact hybrid/electric car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. The 2018 Ioniq was offered in three different powertrains: a hybrid, a plug-in hybrid, and a full electric. The hybrid model is equipped with a 1.6-liter GDI four-cylinder engine producing 104 horsepower and 109 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 43-hp electric motor for a combined system output of 139 hp, and a six-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). The plug-in hybrid model has the same 1.6-liter engine, but a larger 60-hp electric motor with a total combined power output of 156 hp. The electric model has an 88kW electric motor making 118 hp and 218 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Ioniq for its fuel economy, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. However, some criticisms include relatively uninspired driving dynamics and some concerns about long-term battery life in the EV model.
