Here's a breakdown of the common issues reported for the 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5, formatted for your website.

The 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 is an all-electric compact SUV that marked a significant step for Hyundai into the EV market. It's offered in several trim levels with varying battery sizes and motor configurations, offering both rear-wheel-drive (RWD) and all-wheel-drive (AWD) options. The base SE Standard Range RWD model features a 58 kWh battery paired with a single motor producing 168 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Long Range RWD models utilize a 77.4 kWh battery boosting power to 225 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. AWD models use the larger 77.4 kWh battery and two electric motors generating a combined 320 horsepower and 446 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Ioniq 5's retro-futuristic styling, spacious and comfortable interior, rapid charging capabilities, and smooth ride. Criticisms often include limited availability of the more desirable trim levels, some concerns about real-world range compared to EPA estimates, and infotainment system quirks.

**Electric Motor**

**Single Motor RWD (168 hp & 225 hp)**

*   **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a sudden reduction in power, often referred to as "turtle mode," especially when the battery is at a lower state of charge or under high demand. This can lead to significantly reduced acceleration and top speed.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the Battery Management System (BMS) have been implemented to address this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Dual Motor AWD (320 hp)**

*   **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the RWD models, some AWD owners have also reported experiencing "turtle mode," sometimes accompanied by error messages. This seems to be related to battery management and power distribution issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the BMS have been implemented to address this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery System**

*   **Excessive Range Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A few owners have reported experiencing a higher-than-expected rate of battery capacity degradation over a relatively short period. This results in a noticeable decrease in the vehicle's range.
    *   Solution: Battery health is monitored and can be tested under warranty. Replacement may be required if degradation exceeds a specified threshold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under warranty if within specified parameters.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Ioniq 5 relies on a traditional 12V battery to power auxiliary systems. Some owners have reported the 12V battery draining prematurely, leading to issues such as the car not starting or various electrical malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replacing the 12V battery and ensuring proper charging of the 12V battery by the high voltage battery system. A software update might be needed to optimize 12V charging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, which controls navigation, media, and vehicle settings, can sometimes freeze, become unresponsive, or unexpectedly reboot.
    *   Solution: Software updates are the primary solution. Sometimes a hard reset of the system is required. In rare cases, hardware replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are generally free. Hardware replacement would be covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found
* **ICCU Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: This is a known issue where the Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU) can fail, leading to the vehicle being unable to charge either at home or at public charging stations. Symptoms include warning lights on the dashboard related to charging or the high-voltage system, and the car failing to initiate a charging session.
    * Solution: The ICCU unit needs to be replaced by a certified Hyundai technician.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Typically covered under the vehicle's 5-year/60,000-mile new vehicle warranty or the 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty (depending on the component affected and warranty terms).
    * Recalls: 24V-011, 24V-012

**Exterior**

* **Charge Port Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported problems with the automatic charge port door, including difficulty opening or closing properly. This can be caused by a faulty latch mechanism or motor.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the charge port door latch or motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the HVAC system, including inconsistent heating or cooling, failure to switch between modes, or unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the HVAC system components, such as the compressor, blower motor, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 is a generally well-regarded EV. However, some owners have reported issues with power reduction, 12V battery drain, infotainment glitches, charge port doors, and HVAC system malfunctions. These issues vary in severity, but most are addressed through software updates or component replacements covered under warranty. The ICCU failure is a more serious concern, as it can render the vehicle unusable until repaired.
