### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Hyundai Ioniq generally exhibits good technical reliability, particularly in its powertrain components across hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric variants. The 1.6L hybrid engine and the dual-clutch transmission have shown few significant issues. The electric motor and single-speed transmission in the EV model are also robust. The primary areas of concern are related to the long-term health of the battery packs, which can experience degradation over time, and occasional minor glitches within the infotainment system. These are not uncommon for vehicles in this segment and often fall under warranty. Other systems like suspension, exterior, and interior components appear to be holding up well with no widespread problems reported, suggesting a solid overall build quality for the Ioniq.
