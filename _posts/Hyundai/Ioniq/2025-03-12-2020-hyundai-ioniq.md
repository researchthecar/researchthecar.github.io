Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2020 Hyundai Ioniq, categorized and formatted as requested. The 2020 Hyundai Ioniq came in three main flavors: Hybrid, Plug-in Hybrid, and Electric. The Hybrid uses a 1.6-liter GDI four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 139 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The Plug-in Hybrid uses the same engine but with a larger battery pack for increased electric-only range. The Electric version features a 134 horsepower electric motor. Many owners appreciate the Ioniq's fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and generous standard features. Common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling, limited rear headroom (especially in the Hybrid), and the Electric version's relatively short range compared to some competitors.

*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the BMS software, leading to inaccurate state-of-charge readings, reduced range, or unexpected charging behavior. In some cases, the vehicle may display error messages related to the battery system.
    *   Solution: A software update to the BMS is usually the recommended fix. Hyundai dealerships can perform this update.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Usually covered under warranty. If not, potentially $100 - $200+ for diagnosis and software update.

    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified EV technician is needed to pinpoint the source of the noise/vibration. Potential repairs could involve replacing motor mounts, bearings, or, in more severe cases, the electric motor itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause and repair needed. Could range from $100+ for minor adjustments to $1,000+ for motor replacement.
