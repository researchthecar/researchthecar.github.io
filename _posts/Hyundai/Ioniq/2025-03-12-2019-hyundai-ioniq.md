Here is a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Hyundai Ioniq, broken down by category and engine/transmission type.

The 2019 Hyundai Ioniq is a compact car available as a hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and all-electric vehicle. The hybrid model features a 1.6-liter GDI four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 139 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. It uses a six-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). The plug-in hybrid uses the same engine, but with a larger battery for increased electric range. The all-electric model features an electric motor producing 134 horsepower and 218 lb-ft of torque. The all-electric model uses a single-speed reduction gear transmission. People appreciate the Ioniq for its excellent fuel economy, affordability, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include lackluster acceleration (particularly in the hybrid models), a somewhat bland interior, and limited cargo space.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor (All Electric)**

*   **Reduced Battery Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report a noticeable decrease in battery range, especially in colder temperatures or after several years of use. The indicated range on the dashboard may not accurately reflect the actual driving range.
    *   Solution: A software update to the Battery Management System (BMS) can sometimes improve range estimation accuracy. In cases of significant degradation, battery replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement $8,000 - $15,000+ (depending on battery size and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Electric Motor Failure**
