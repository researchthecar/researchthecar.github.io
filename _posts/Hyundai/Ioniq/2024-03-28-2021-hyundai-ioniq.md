**Introduction:**
The 2021 Hyundai Ioniq is a hybrid electric vehicle that combines a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine with an electric motor for a total output of 139 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The gasoline engine is mated to a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission, while the electric motor is paired with a single-speed direct-drive transmission. The Ioniq also offers a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) model with a 111-horsepower electric motor and an 8.9 kWh battery pack that provides up to 29 miles of all-electric range. The PHEV is paired with a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission for the gasoline engine and a single-speed direct-drive transmission for the electric motor.

Drivers appreciate the Ioniq's fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. However, some have reported issues with the vehicle's engine, transmission, electrical system, and interior.
