### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Hyundai Ioniq demonstrates commendable reliability across its hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric variants. While the core mechanical components like the engine and transmission are generally robust, potential owners should be aware of isolated electrical concerns. The primary areas to monitor are the longevity of the high-voltage battery pack, particularly in the EV model, and occasional software glitches within the infotainment system. The 12V auxiliary battery can also be a point of failure. However, these issues are not pervasive and do not detract significantly from the Ioniq's overall reputation for dependability and low running costs. With proactive maintenance and awareness of these specific potential issues, the 2020 Ioniq remains a solid choice for budget-conscious and environmentally aware drivers.
