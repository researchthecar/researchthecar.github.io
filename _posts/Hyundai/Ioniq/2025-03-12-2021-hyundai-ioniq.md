Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2021 Hyundai Ioniq, categorized by major component. This information is based on available owner reports, complaints, and recall data. The 2021 Hyundai Ioniq is available in three configurations: Hybrid, Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV), and Electric. The Hybrid model uses a 1.6-liter GDI four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 139 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The Plug-in Hybrid utilizes the same 1.6-liter engine but with a larger battery pack for increased electric range. The Electric version boasts a 134 horsepower electric motor powered by a 38.3 kWh battery pack. Owners often praise the Ioniq for its fuel efficiency (or zero emissions for the EV), comfortable ride, and generous warranty. Common dislikes include the somewhat uninspiring interior design and, in some cases, limited rear passenger space.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric**
*   **Motor Control Unit (MCU) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the Motor Control Unit (MCU) in the Electric Ioniq. Symptoms include reduced power, error messages related to the electric motor, and in some cases, complete failure preventing the car from starting or operating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty MCU. In some cases, a software update may address the issue if it's related to a software glitch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

**Electric**
*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have occasionally reported issues with the Battery Management System (BMS). These can manifest as inaccurate state of charge readings, reduced range, and charging problems. In some cases, the BMS may incorrectly report battery health, leading to premature degradation warnings.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician to determine the root cause. May involve software updates to the BMS, cell balancing procedures, or in rare cases, battery pack replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ (for BMS repairs/software updates). Battery pack replacement can be significantly more expensive.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Reduced Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience a decrease in the electric range compared to the advertised range, especially in cold weather or after a few years of use.
    *   Solution: This can be due to multiple factors, including driving habits, climate, battery degradation, and tire pressure. There may not be a "fix," but optimizing driving style, maintaining proper tire pressure, and avoiding rapid acceleration/deceleration can help. In some cases, a battery health check by a dealer is recommended to assess the level of degradation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A unless battery pack replacement is deemed necessary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Charging System**

**Electric**

*   **Onboard Charger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the onboard charger fails or exhibits slow charging speeds. This can impact both AC and DC fast charging.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and potential replacement of the onboard charger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Hybrid**

*   No Issues Found

**Plug-in Hybrid**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, lags, or spontaneously reboots. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often released to address these issues. In some cases, a system reset or replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue). $500 - $1500+ for infotainment unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **"Check Hybrid System" Warning Light (Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "Check Hybrid System" warning light may illuminate, indicating a potential issue with the hybrid powertrain. This can be triggered by a variety of sensors or system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is required to determine the root cause. The fix depends on the specific issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable depending on the underlying problem.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Backup camera image is distorted, black, or completely non-functional.
    *   Solution: Inspect the camera wiring and connection. Replace the camera unit if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Inverter Issue**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners are reporting a blinking light, in place of Ready to drive, with a "Stop Safely" warning and a Check Inverter message displayed.
    *   Solution: Inverter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000+
    *   Recalls: 23V-262

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False activation of the AEB system, causing unexpected braking. This is a potentially dangerous issue.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the AEB system. Calibration of the radar or camera sensors used by the AEB system. In some cases, sensor replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue), $300 - $800+ for sensor replacement and calibration.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   No Issues Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Hyundai Ioniq, especially the Electric variant, faces some notable challenges primarily in its electrical systems. Issues such as MCU failure, battery management problems, and onboard charger malfunctions can lead to significant repair costs. While the Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid models appear to have fewer widespread issues, the "Check Hybrid System" warning light necessitates a thorough diagnosis and can result in varied repair expenses. Overall, the severity of reported issues ranges from minor inconveniences (infotainment glitches) to serious malfunctions (AEB issues, motor control failures) that can impact safety and drivability. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider extended warranties or thorough pre-purchase inspections.
