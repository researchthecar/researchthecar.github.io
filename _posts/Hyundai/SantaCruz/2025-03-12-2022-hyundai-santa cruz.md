Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options, along with relevant details.

The 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz is a unique vehicle, blending the characteristics of a compact pickup truck with the comfort and styling of an SUV. It comes with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and a more powerful 2.5L turbocharged inline-4 generating 281 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque, mated to an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Many owners appreciate the Santa Cruz's comfortable ride, stylish design, and versatile bed, making it suitable for both daily commuting and light-duty hauling. However, some common criticisms include limited rear passenger space, and certain tech features that can be finicky.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 (Non-Turbo)**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing hesitation or stalling, particularly during initial acceleration or at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Software update, fuel system inspection, or throttle body cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update only) - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (with 2.5L Non-Turbo)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, and occasionally during downshifts.
    *   Solution: Software update, transmission fluid change, or valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update only) - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) (with 2.5L Turbo)**

*   **DCT Hesitation/Jerking at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint is the DCT's tendency to hesitate or jerk at very low speeds (like parking or in stop-and-go traffic). This is typical of dual-clutch transmissions, but some owners find it more pronounced in the Santa Cruz.
    *   Solution: Software update to refine DCT control logic. While this can improve the experience, it rarely eliminates the behavior entirely. Some owners have had the clutch actuator replaced under warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update only) - $1500+ (for clutch actuator replacement out of warranty)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn suspension components (bushings, struts, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software update. If that doesn't work, the head unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update) - $1000+ (for head unit replacement out of warranty)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **"Check Blind Spot System" Warning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A false "Check Blind Spot System" warning may appear intermittently, even when the system is functioning correctly.
