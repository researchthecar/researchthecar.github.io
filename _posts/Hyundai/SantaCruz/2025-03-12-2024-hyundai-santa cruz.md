The 2024 Hyundai Santa Cruz is a unique Sport Adventure Vehicle, blending the practicality of a compact pickup with the comfort and agility of an SUV. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 GDI engine producing 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.5L inline-4 turbocharged GDI engine that delivers 281 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque. The base engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the turbocharged engine is mated to an 8-speed wet dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praise the Santa Cruz for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and versatile bed, but some criticisms include limited rear seat space and a less traditional truck-like appearance that may not appeal to all pickup enthusiasts.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 GDI**
* **Engine Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine stalling unexpectedly, particularly at low speeds or when idling. This can be intermittent and may not always trigger a check engine light.
    * Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking the fuel system, including the fuel pump and injectors, as well as the engine control unit (ECU) for any stored error codes. Software updates to the ECU may also be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and parts required)
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Inline-4 Turbocharged GDI**
* **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports have surfaced of turbocharger failures, evidenced by a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or screeching), and potentially a check engine light.
    * Solution: Inspection of the turbocharger for damage or leaks. Replacement of the turbocharger unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on labor and parts)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (paired with 2.5L non-turbo)**
* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This may be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) are the common fixes, but in some rare cases, a valve body or entire transmission replacement might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (for fluid flush and software update); $2,000 - $5,000+ (for valve body or transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Wet Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) (paired with 2.5L turbo)**
* **Hesitation or Jerking at Low Speeds**
    * Description/Symptoms: DCTs are known for occasional hesitation or jerky behavior at low speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. This is due to the nature of the dual-clutch system and can be more pronounced in certain driving conditions.
    * Solution: While not always a fix, software updates to the TCM can sometimes improve the smoothness of the transmission. Driving technique also plays a role; smooth and consistent throttle input can minimize the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (for software update)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot while driving. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    * Solution: Software updates are often the first step in addressing this issue. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,200+ (for head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Blind Spot Monitoring System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The blind spot monitoring system may intermittently fail to detect vehicles in the blind spot, or may give false alerts when no vehicles are present.
    * Solution: Check the sensors and wiring for damage or obstruction. Software updates may also be available. If the problem persists, the sensors may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and parts required)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate Alignment Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the tailgate not aligning properly, causing difficulty in closing or opening, or creating a gap that can allow water to enter the bed.
    * Solution: Adjustment of the tailgate hinges and latch. In some cases, replacement of the latch mechanism may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the severity and parts required)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling Noises from Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard area, particularly on rough roads. This may be caused by loose trim pieces or wiring harnesses.
    * Solution: Identifying and securing the source of the rattle. This may involve tightening screws, adding padding, or re-routing wiring harnesses.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (depending on the complexity of the repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2024 Hyundai Santa Cruz exhibits a mix of minor and potentially more serious issues. While the engine and transmission concerns, particularly turbocharger failures and DCT hesitation, could lead to substantial repair costs, other issues like infotainment glitches and tailgate alignment problems are generally less severe. Overall, the severity of potential issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and ensure a thorough inspection before purchasing.
