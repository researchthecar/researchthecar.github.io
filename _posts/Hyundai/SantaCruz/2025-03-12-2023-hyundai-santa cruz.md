The 2023 Hyundai Santa Cruz is a unique vehicle, blending the characteristics of a compact SUV and a pickup truck. It offers two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful turbocharged 2.5L inline-4 cylinder engine generating 281 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque. The base engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the turbo engine comes with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praise the Santa Cruz for its comfortable ride, stylish design, and practical bed. Common complaints often revolve around the DCT transmission feeling jerky at low speeds, especially in the Turbo configuration, fuel economy not meeting expectations, and limited bed space compared to traditional trucks.
