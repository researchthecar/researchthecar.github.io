Similarly, the suspension and core exterior/interior components appear robust. The primary areas where minor concerns have been noted are within the electrical system, specifically occasional infotainment glitches that are often resolvable with software updates, and a few reports of premature 12V battery failure. Overall, the Santa Cruz offers a promising start in terms of dependability, with most owners likely to experience a trouble-free ownership period, provided these minor electrical quirks are addressed.
