### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Hyundai Tiburon presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around age-related wear, particularly with engine oil leaks and timing belt maintenance for the 2.0L, and potential overheating for the 2.7L V6. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can manifest as harsh shifting. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts are also points of concern, as are electrical gremlins such as window regulators and instrument cluster problems. Exterior rust can be a significant issue depending on climate. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these common problem areas, especially as the vehicle ages. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maximizing the lifespan and reliability of a 2001 Tiburon.
