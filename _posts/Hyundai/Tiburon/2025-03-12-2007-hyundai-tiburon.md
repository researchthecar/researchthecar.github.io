Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2007 Hyundai Tiburon, categorized for clarity. The 2007 Hyundai Tiburon is a sporty coupe that offered two engine choices: a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder and a 2.7L V6. The 2.0L engine produced approximately 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.7L V6 delivered around 172 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic for the 2.0L engine, and a 6-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic for the 2.7L engine. Owners generally appreciate the Tiburon's sporty styling, affordable price point, and decent handling. Common dislikes include its relatively low fuel economy for the class, cramped rear seating, and some concerns about long-term reliability.
