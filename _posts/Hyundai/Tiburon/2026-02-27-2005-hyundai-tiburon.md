### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Hyundai Tiburon is a generally reliable sporty coupe, particularly if well-maintained. The most common reported issues tend to be related to the engine's timing belt (a critical maintenance item), oil leaks from seals and gaskets, and typical wear items in the suspension like ball joints and tie rod ends. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can arise but are often addressable with fluid changes or solenoid replacements. Electrical components like window motors and alternators can also fail. Proactive maintenance, especially the timing belt replacement at recommended intervals, is crucial for preventing more significant and costly engine damage. Overall, for its age and market segment, the Tiburon offers a reasonable ownership experience with manageable potential repairs.
