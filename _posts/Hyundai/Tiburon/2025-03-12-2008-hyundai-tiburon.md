The 2008 Hyundai Tiburon, also known as the Hyundai Coupe in some markets, is a sporty two-door coupe that aimed to offer style and fun at an affordable price. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.7L V6 engine producing around 172 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic for the 2.0L engine, and a 6-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic for the 2.7L engine. Owners often praised the Tiburon for its sleek design, sporty handling, and value. Common complaints centered on the relatively weak base engine (2.0L), the outdated 4-speed automatic transmission, and some interior plastic quality.

**Engine**

*   **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may exhibit a rough idle, particularly when cold. Some owners reported stalling issues, especially at idle or when coming to a stop.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body and Idle Air Control (IAC) valve can sometimes resolve this issue. In more severe cases, the Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF) may need to be replaced.
