### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Hyundai Tiburon presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain is generally robust, owners should be aware of potential oil leaks and the critical nature of timing belt maintenance, especially on the V6. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can arise. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, can be frustrating. Exterior issues like clogged sunroof drains are manageable but can lead to interior damage if ignored. Overall, with diligent maintenance and attention to these known issues, the Tiburon can remain a reliable and enjoyable sporty coupe.
