# 2006 Hyundai Tiburon

### Overview
The 2006 Hyundai Tiburon, a sporty compact coupe, offered a blend of style and performance for its era. It was available with two distinct engine options, a 2.0L inline-4 and a more potent 2.7L V6, paired with either a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual (on V6), or 4-speed automatic transmission. While generally considered a reasonably reliable vehicle for its price point, certain areas have seen more frequent reports of issues than others. Owners often praise its distinctive styling and engaging driving dynamics, especially with the V6 engine. However, like many vehicles of this age, potential buyers should be aware of common problem areas that may require attention.

### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Hyundai Tiburon presents a mixed reliability profile. While its sporty design and performance are appealing, potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The engines, particularly the 2.0L, can experience oil consumption and timing belt problems, while the 2.7L V6 may develop oil leaks or VIM actuator issues. Automatic transmissions can be prone to harsh shifting, and manual clutches will eventually need replacement. Electrical systems, especially the BCM and alternator, are also noted areas for potential concern. Exterior paint and interior upholstery can show wear typical for its age. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Tiburons have provided years of service with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
