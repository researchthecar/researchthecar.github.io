Here is a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2004 Hyundai Tiburon, categorized by vehicle component. The 2004 Hyundai Tiburon, also known as the Hyundai Coupe in some markets, is a sporty compact car known for its stylish design and affordability. Engine options include a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L V6 engine generating around 170 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices include a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic (primarily paired with the 2.0L), and a 6-speed manual (typically with the 2.7L). Owners often appreciate the Tiburon's sporty appearance and value for money, but common complaints involve build quality, reliability issues, and the performance of the base 2.0L engine.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder Engine**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt can fail prematurely, especially if not replaced at the recommended interval. Symptoms include engine misfires, loss of power, and, in severe cases, complete engine failure if valves are damaged.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt according to the manufacturer's recommended service interval (typically every 60,000 miles). Also replace the water pump and tensioners at the same time, as failure of these components can lead to timing belt failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The IAC valve can become clogged or fail, leading to erratic idling, stalling, or difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6 Engine**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets are common as the engine ages. This can lead to oil loss, burning smells, and potentially damage to other engine components if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**

    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (Primarily with 2.0L)**

*   **Shift Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hard or delayed shifting, particularly between gears. This can be caused by worn solenoids, low transmission fluid, or internal transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Check and top off or replace the transmission fluid. If the problem persists, have the transmission diagnosed by a qualified mechanic, which may involve replacing solenoids or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $1500+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission (Typically with 2.7L)**

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears, especially 2nd and 3rd, can indicate worn synchros.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn synchros or rebuild the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noises (clunking, popping) from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Worn strut mounts can also negatively affect handling.
