The 2005 Hyundai Tiburon is a sporty coupe known for its sleek styling and relatively affordable price point. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder (138 hp, 136 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.7L V6 (172 hp, 181 lb-ft of torque). Transmissions were either a 5-speed manual (2.0L), 6-speed manual (2.7L), or a 4-speed automatic (both engines). Owners often praise the Tiburon for its sporty looks and handling, while common complaints include a lack of refinement, road noise, and some reliability concerns, particularly as the vehicles age.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Addressing excessive oil consumption can involve various approaches. Initially, verify the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) valve's functionality to ensure proper crankcase pressure regulation. If the PCV valve is not the cause, a compression test and leak-down test can assist in pinpointing the source of oil consumption, which may be worn piston rings or valve seals. Based on the test results, consider replacing the piston rings, valve seals, or both, depending on their condition and wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the repairs and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idling/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may idle roughly or stall, particularly at stoplights or after starting.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve. Check for vacuum leaks and repair as needed. A tune-up (spark plugs, wires) can also improve idle quality.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt can fail prematurely if not replaced at the recommended interval (typically 60,000 miles). Failure can result in significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, water pump, tensioner, and idler pulleys as a preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets. This can cause burning oil smells and eventually oil drips.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may shift harshly, slip between gears, or fail to engage gears properly.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, it may indicate internal damage requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $2000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission (2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder)**

*No Issues Found*

**6-Speed Manual Transmission (2.7L V6)**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, vague handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, and/or ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per bushing/joint, depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window motor.
