The 2006 Hyundai Tiburon is a sporty coupe that was available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 and a 2.7-liter V6. The 2.0L engine produced around 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. The 2.7L produced around 172 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (2.0L), 6-speed manual (2.7L), and a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Tiburon for its sporty styling and relatively affordable price. Common complaints often centered around the car's ride quality (being somewhat harsh), interior materials, and potential for reliability issues as the car aged.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**
* **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine idles roughly, especially when cold, and may stall. Can also include reduced power and hesitation during acceleration.
    * Solution: Clean the throttle body. Replace the idle air control valve (IACV) if cleaning doesn't resolve the issue. Check for vacuum leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on which parts are needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminates with codes related to oxygen sensors (e.g., P0130, P0131, P0135). Reduced fuel economy and poor engine performance.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor. Typically, either the upstream (pre-catalytic converter) or downstream (post-catalytic converter) sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6**
* **Timing Belt Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 is an interference engine. Failure to replace the timing belt at the recommended interval can result in catastrophic engine damage if the belt breaks. Symptoms can include ticking or rattling noises from the engine, especially at idle or during acceleration.
    * Solution: Replace the timing belt, water pump, tensioner, and idler pulley as a preventative measure every 60,000 miles (or as specified in the owner's manual). If the belt has already broken, the engine may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ depending on if there is catastrophic damage
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often originating from valve cover gaskets or the oil pan gasket. Noticeable oil spots under the car and a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**
* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard or delayed shifts between gears. Transmission slipping, especially when accelerating or going uphill. Check engine light may illuminate with transmission-related codes.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush. If the problem persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $2500+ (rebuild/replace)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll in turns. Visible oil leaks from the struts/shocks.
    * Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks. Replacing both front struts or both rear shocks at the same time is recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Broken or Worn Stabilizer Bar Links**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    * Solution: Replace the worn stabilizer bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power windows stop working, or move very slowly. Grinding noises may be heard when attempting to operate the windows.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator and/or motor assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of gauges in the instrument cluster. Backlighting may flicker or fail.
    * Solution: Replace or repair the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust (Especially in Salt-Prone Areas)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the undercarriage, around the wheel wells, and on other body panels.
    * Solution: Treat and repair any rust spots. For severe rust, body panel replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof failing to open or close properly. Leaks around the sunroof seal.
    * Solution: Clean and lubricate the sunroof tracks and mechanism. Replace the sunroof seal if leaking. Repair or replace the sunroof motor if it's faulty.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2006 Hyundai Tiburon, while stylish, exhibits several common issues as it ages. Engine problems, especially with the timing belt on the V6 and rough idle on the 4-cylinder, can be costly if neglected. Suspension wear is typical for a car of this age. Electrical problems, like window regulators and instrument cluster failures, also contribute to the overall ownership experience. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive repairs, others, such as transmission problems or major engine work, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the car for these common issues before purchasing.
