**Introduction to the 1998 Hyundai Tiburon**

The 1998 Hyundai Tiburon is a two-door sports coupe that was available with a choice of two engines: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 130 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.7-liter V6 engine with 170 horsepower and 183 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Tiburon was praised for its sporty handling and aggressive styling, but it was also criticized for its cramped interior and lack of power from the 2.0-liter engine.
