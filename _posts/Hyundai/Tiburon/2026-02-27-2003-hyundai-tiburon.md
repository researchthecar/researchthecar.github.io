# 2003 Hyundai Tiburon

### Overview
The 2003 Hyundai Tiburon, a sporty compact coupe, offered a blend of style and performance for its era. It was available with two primary engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 and a more potent 2.7L V6. Transmission choices typically included a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. While generally considered a decent value, like any vehicle of this age, it has specific areas where owners have reported issues. This analysis focuses on common mechanical and electrical problems, excluding routine maintenance, to provide a clearer picture of its long-term reliability.

### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Hyundai Tiburon presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around age-related wear, particularly oil leaks from both engine variants and potential timing belt failures, which can be costly if not addressed proactively. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can arise, manifesting as rough shifting. Suspension components like bushings and shocks are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument clusters, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for maintenance and potential repairs typical of a vehicle of this vintage, especially concerning the engine and transmission.
