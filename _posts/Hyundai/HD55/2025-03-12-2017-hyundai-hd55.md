Okay, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2017 Hyundai HD55, categorized and formatted as requested. Please note that accessing comprehensive and definitively accurate data on specific issues for commercial vehicles like the HD55 can be challenging due to limited public reporting compared to passenger cars. This information is compiled from available sources, including owner forums and repair databases. I have tried to be as thorough as possible.

The 2017 Hyundai HD55 is a light-duty commercial truck designed for various applications. Engine options for the 2017 model year typically include a 2.5-liter CRDi diesel engine, producing approximately 130 horsepower and 255 Nm of torque. Transmission options usually consist of a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners appreciate the HD55 for its reliability, maneuverability in urban environments, and relatively low operating costs. Common dislikes center around the basic interior features, limited cargo capacity compared to larger trucks, and potential challenges in sourcing specialized parts.

**Engine**

**2.5L CRDi Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, engine misfires, and difficulty starting the engine. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to injector performance (e.g., P0201-P0204) may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty injector(s) with new or remanufactured units. Ensure proper coding of the new injectors to the engine control unit (ECU) is performed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per injector (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling or whining noises from the turbocharger, excessive oil consumption, and black smoke from the exhaust. The vehicle may exhibit sluggish acceleration and increased turbo lag.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the turbocharger for damage or wear. If necessary, rebuild or replace the turbocharger. Check and address any oil leaks in the turbocharger system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (depending on whether rebuild or replacement is needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor engine performance, increased emissions, and a check engine light with codes related to the EGR system (e.g., P0401, P0402). The engine may stall or hesitate during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve. Inspection of the EGR cooler for blockage. Ensure proper operation of the EGR system components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the severity and whether cleaning or replacement is needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting/Gear Grinding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, grinding noises during gear changes, and a general feeling of stiffness or resistance when shifting. This is most likely to be noticed when shifting into 2nd and 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust the clutch cable or hydraulic clutch system for proper operation. Inspect the synchronizers, gears, and shift forks inside the transmission for wear or damage. Replace worn or damaged components. Gear oil replacement may improve shifting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the extent of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, especially when accelerating or driving uphill. A burning smell may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. Check the flywheel for damage and resurface or replace as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower on one side, uneven tire wear, and a rough ride. Leaf springs may show visible signs of cracking, bending, or breakage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected leaf spring(s). Consider replacing leaf springs in pairs to maintain even suspension performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per leaf spring (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and increased stopping distances. Shock absorbers may show signs of leaking fluid.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per shock absorber (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery frequently dies or struggles to start the engine. Could be caused by an interior light left on, but if not, there may be a parasitic draw from the electrical system.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the electrical system to identify the source of the drain. Repair or replace faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Wiring Harness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as malfunctioning lights, sensors, or other electrical components. Could be caused by a rodent infestation.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the damaged section of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the damage).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Chassis/Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust formation on the chassis/frame components, particularly in areas exposed to road salt and moisture.
    *   Solution: Rust removal and application of rust preventative coating. Repair or replacement of severely corroded sections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the severity of the rust).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Hyundai HD55, while generally reliable, can experience issues related to its diesel engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. Engine issues like injector failure and turbocharger problems can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues, particularly those related to shifting, can impact driveability. Suspension concerns, mainly related to leaf springs, may affect ride quality and load-carrying capacity. Electrical problems, such as battery drain, require thorough diagnosis. Rust on the chassis can also be a concern, especially in regions with harsh winter conditions. Overall, while some issues can be relatively minor, others may result in substantial repair expenses.
