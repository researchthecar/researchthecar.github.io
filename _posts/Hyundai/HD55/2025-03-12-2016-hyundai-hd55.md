**Engine**

**3.9L D4DB Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, black smoke from the exhaust, reduced fuel efficiency, and potential engine misfires. These issues often stem from clogged or malfunctioning fuel injectors that fail to deliver fuel properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis via OBD-II scanner to identify faulty injectors. Replacement of the problematic injectors is the standard fix. Cleaning of the fuel system may also be recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable loss of power, whistling or screeching noises from the engine bay during acceleration, and the engine warning light illuminating. This may be caused by oil starvation or damage to the turbocharger's internal components.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the turbocharger for physical damage or oil leaks. If the turbocharger is damaged, replacement is typically required. Oil lines should also be checked for blockages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (depending on the brand and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.9L D4GA Diesel**

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, decreased fuel economy, and the engine warning light. The EGR valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, preventing it from functioning properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic check to confirm EGR valve failure. Cleaning the EGR valve might resolve the issue, but in most cases, replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the cost of the EGR valve and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding noises during gear changes, difficulty engaging certain gears, and the gear lever feeling stiff or unresponsive. This can be due to worn synchronizers, clutch issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Inspect the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, a fluid change may help. If the problem persists, a mechanic should inspect the clutch, synchronizers, and shift linkages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $1500+ (clutch or synchronizer replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, and a high or spongy clutch pedal feel. This is due to wear and tear on the clutch disc, pressure plate, or throw-out bearing.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+ (depending on the brand and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging or Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced load-carrying capacity, uneven vehicle ride height, and clunking noises from the rear suspension. Over time, the leaf springs can weaken and sag, or even develop cracks.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the leaf springs for damage or wear. Replacement of the affected leaf springs is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ (per spring, including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery frequently dies, requiring frequent jump starts. Possible parasitic drain from faulty lights, accessories, or wiring.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic drain test to find what is causing the drain and replace the faulty module/item.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the source of the drain and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuses Blowing Frequently**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A specific electrical component stops working, and the corresponding fuse blows repeatedly after replacement. This indicates a short circuit or excessive current draw in that circuit.
    *   Solution: Inspect the wiring and components associated with the affected circuit for damage or shorts. Repair or replace the faulty wiring or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the location of the short and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage/Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust formation, especially in areas exposed to road salt or moisture. If left untreated, this can compromise the structural integrity of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Sandblasting rusted areas, applying rust converter, and applying a protective coating or paint. Severe cases may require welding repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the rust).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement, overlay, or repair kit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the repair option chosen and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Hyundai HD55, while generally reliable, can encounter issues primarily related to its engine, transmission, and suspension components due to its commercial usage. Issues such as fuel injector problems, turbocharger failure, and clutch wear are the most commonly reported. Rust and electrical problems were also common issues, though less than the mechanical ones. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others like turbocharger or clutch replacement can be more costly. Potential buyers should prioritize a thorough inspection of these components before purchasing.
