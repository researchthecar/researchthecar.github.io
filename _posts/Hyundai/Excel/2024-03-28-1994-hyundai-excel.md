**Introduction:**
The 1994 Hyundai Excel was a subcompact car available with two engine options: a 1.5L SOHC I4 and a 1.6L DOHC I4. The 1.5L engine produced 73 horsepower and 89 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.6L engine produced 92 horsepower and 108 lb-ft of torque. The 1.5L engine was paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, while the 1.6L engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Excel was praised for its low price and fuel economy, but criticized for its lack of power and interior space.
