The 2003 Hyundai Accent is a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a 1.5L SOHC 12-valve inline 4-cylinder engine producing around 92 horsepower and 97 lb-ft of torque, and later a 1.6L DOHC 16-valve inline 4-cylinder engine producing around 103 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque. Transmissions were typically a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Accent's low price point and simple design, making it easy to maintain. Common complaints include a lack of power, particularly with the 1.5L engine, and concerns about the car's long-term reliability and build quality.
