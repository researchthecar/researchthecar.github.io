The 2009 Hyundai Accent is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It was available as a 3-door hatchback, 4-door sedan. The 2009 Accent came with only one engine option: a 1.6-liter inline-4 cylinder engine that produces 110 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. People liked the Accent for its low price, good gas mileage, and relatively spacious interior for a subcompact. Common dislikes included the somewhat unrefined engine, basic interior materials, and lack of advanced features compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2009 Hyundai Accent, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine-related problems, such as catalytic converter and ignition coil failures, are relatively frequent. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can be more costly to repair. Suspension wear is typical for a car of this age, and electrical problems, such as alternator or sensor failures, can occur. Rust can also be a concern, especially in certain climates. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and have the vehicle inspected by a trusted mechanic before purchasing.
