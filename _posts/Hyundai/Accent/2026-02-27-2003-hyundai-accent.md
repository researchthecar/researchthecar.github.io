### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Hyundai Accent is a budget-friendly vehicle that, while generally functional, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and class. The 1.6L engine can suffer from oil leaks and potential timing belt issues, which can be costly if the belt breaks. Both manual and automatic transmissions have documented problems, ranging from clutch wear and synchronizer issues in manuals to harsh shifting and TCM failures in automatics. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are prone to wear, and electrical issues such as alternator failure and power window motor problems are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a significant concern in certain climates. Interiorly, HVAC blower motors and door lock actuators are known failure points. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the Accent to be a dependable, albeit basic, mode of transport when properly maintained and when common wear items are addressed proactively.
