The 2021 Hyundai Accent is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It comes with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine that produces 120 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). People generally like the Accent for its value, fuel economy, and ease of use. Common dislikes include a somewhat lackluster driving experience and limited rear seat space.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a knocking or pinging sound coming from the engine, especially during acceleration or when the engine is under load. This can be more prevalent when using lower octane fuel.
    *   Solution: Try using higher octane fuel. If the problem persists, have the engine checked for proper ignition timing, fuel delivery issues, or carbon buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners may notice that the engine is consuming more oil than usual, requiring more frequent oil additions between scheduled oil changes. This can sometimes be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Start with a compression and leak-down test to determine the health of the engine. If the results are good, the valve stem seals or PCV valve may be faulty. However, if the rings are bad, the engine will likely need to be rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5,000+, depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is struggling to find the right gear ratio.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the CVT may need to be inspected and potentially replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) to $4,000+ (for CVT replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In rare cases, the CVT transmission can fail prematurely, requiring a complete replacement. Symptoms include loud noises, slipping, and inability to accelerate.
    *   Solution: Replace the CVT Transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**
*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Shocks/Struts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of the shocks or struts, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. Noises such as clunking or rattling from the suspension may also be present.
    * Solution: Replace worn shocks and struts. Inspect suspension components for any damage
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may require a reboot of the system to restore functionality.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) to $500+ (for unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera image may be distorted, blurry, or completely absent. This can be intermittent or constant.
    *   Solution: Check the camera wiring and connections. If the wiring is intact, the camera unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the issue and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Wind Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing high levels of wind noise, especially at highway speeds.
    * Solution: Replace weather stripping, apply tape over crevices such as door jams.

**Interior**

* **Rattling/Squeaking Sounds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rattling and squeaking sounds emanating from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or seats.
    *   Solution: Tighten any loose screws or fasteners. Apply felt tape or lubricant to areas where the panels are rubbing together.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ depending on the location and severity of the noise.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Hyundai Accent is a budget-friendly vehicle that provides good value for the money, but owners may experience a few common issues. Engine knocking and oil consumption are the most commonly reported engine issues. CVT issues can range from minor hesitation to complete transmission failure. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and backup camera are also potential concerns. While the severity and cost of these issues vary, it's essential for prospective buyers to be aware of them and to have the vehicle inspected before purchase.
