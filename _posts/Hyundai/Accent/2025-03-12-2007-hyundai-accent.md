The 2007 Hyundai Accent is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It was offered with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing approximately 110 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its low price and fuel economy, but common complaints include a lack of features, limited rear passenger space, and a somewhat basic interior.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 (G4ED)**

*   **Check Engine Light - P0420 Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and a diagnostic scan reveals the P0420 code. This indicates the catalytic converter is not functioning efficiently, potentially leading to emissions failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter is the most common fix. Sometimes, the issue can be caused by exhaust leaks before the catalytic converter or faulty oxygen sensors, so those should be checked first.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light flashing. Diagnostic codes may indicate cylinder misfires (e.g., P0300, P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304).
    *   Solution: Often caused by worn spark plugs, faulty ignition coils, or vacuum leaks. Start by replacing the spark plugs and inspecting the ignition coils. A compression test can reveal if there are more serious issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeably harsh or delayed shifts between gears. The transmission may slip or fail to engage properly.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is dark or burnt, a fluid and filter change might help. In more severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The driver experiences difficulty engaging certain gears, particularly first or reverse.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust the clutch cable. If the problem persists, the clutch disc, pressure plate, or throw-out bearing may need replacement. In some cases, worn synchronizers within the transmission can also cause this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (clutch cable adjustment) - $800+ (clutch replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll during turns, and bottoming out over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (parts and labor for both front or both rear)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can also cause vague steering feel.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings. In some cases, it might be more cost-effective to replace the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Window Regulator**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working, often with a clicking sound.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks fail to lock or unlock with the remote or power door lock switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the defective door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the rear wheel arches, particularly in regions with harsh winters and road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, patching, and repainting the affected area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per wheel arch, depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to determine the cause of the fault. This could be a faulty sensor, wiring issue, or a problem with the airbag control module. The repair cost can vary widely depending on the specific issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Hyundai Accent, while generally reliable for its price point, does have some common issues. Engine-related problems, such as catalytic converter failure and misfires, can be moderately expensive to address. Transmission issues, especially in the automatic version, can also lead to significant repair costs. Suspension issues are relatively common and can affect ride quality and handling. Electrical problems, such as window regulator and door lock actuator failures, are also frequently reported. The presence of rust, particularly on the rear wheel arches, is a concern in areas with high road salt usage. Overall, while the Accent is an affordable option, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget accordingly for potential repairs.
