The 2008 Hyundai Accent is a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It's a popular choice for budget-conscious buyers. The 2008 Accent came with a single engine option: a 1.6-liter inline-4 producing around 110 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Accent's fuel economy and ease of parking, but often dislike its somewhat basic interior and limited power, especially when loaded with passengers or driving uphill.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 (G4ED)**

*   **Check Engine Light Due to Faulty Oxygen Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates. Diagnostic codes often indicate a problem with the oxygen sensor (O2 sensor). This can lead to decreased fuel economy and potentially affect emissions.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the engine consumes oil at a higher-than-normal rate, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a repair or replacement of piston rings or valve seals may be necessary. Monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed is a simpler, though less permanent, solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (topping off) to $1500+ (engine work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall, run rough, or fail to start. A diagnostic trouble code related to the crankshaft position sensor may be present.

**Summary**

The 2008 Hyundai Accent generally has a mix of minor and moderate issues. Engine-related problems, like oxygen sensor failures and excessive oil consumption, are common. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can be more costly. Suspension wear and tear is also expected. The severity of the issues ranges from inexpensive sensor replacements to more costly engine or transmission work. Checking for airbag recalls is essential.
