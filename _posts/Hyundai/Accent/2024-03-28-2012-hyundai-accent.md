**Introduction:**

The 2012 Hyundai Accent is a subcompact sedan known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and everyday practicality. It comes with two engine options: a 1.6-liter Gamma four-cylinder producing 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter Gamma GDI four-cylinder generating 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with either a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission.

While the Accent has received praise for its value proposition and low running costs, some specific issues have been reported by owners.

**Engine**
