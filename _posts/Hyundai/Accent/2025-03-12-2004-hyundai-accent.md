The 2004 Hyundai Accent is a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a 1.6-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 103 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Accent's low price point and good gas mileage, but common complaints include its basic features, limited space, and somewhat unrefined driving experience.

**Engine**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (can be significantly higher if the engine is damaged due to belt failure)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor can fail, causing the engine to stall, misfire, or not start at all. The check engine light will usually illuminate.
