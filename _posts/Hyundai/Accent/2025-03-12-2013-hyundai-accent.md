The 2013 Hyundai Accent is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It was offered with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that produced around 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque. Buyers generally liked the Accent for its good gas mileage, relatively spacious interior for its class, and attractive styling. Common dislikes included road noise, somewhat unrefined engine, and the lack of some features found in competitors. The Accent was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report a knocking or pinging sound coming from the engine, especially during acceleration or when the engine is under load. This can be more noticeable with lower-grade fuel.
    *   Solution: Using higher-octane fuel might reduce the issue, but a more permanent solution might involve a software update to the engine control unit (ECU). In severe cases, the issue may be related to carbon buildup, requiring a fuel system cleaning or valve cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (fuel additive) - $500+ (ECU update or carbon cleaning).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potentially engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: A possible solution is replacing the piston rings which can be costly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Summary**

The 2013 Hyundai Accent has some common issues, with engine and transmission problems being potentially the most costly. The engine knock and oil consumption issues on the 1.6L engine can lead to expensive repairs if not addressed promptly. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can also require costly repairs or rebuilds. Other issues like suspension and electrical faults are generally less severe and expensive to fix. While the Accent is an affordable car, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase.
