The 2022 Hyundai Accent is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and user-friendly technology. It comes standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 120 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate the Accent's spacious interior for its class, responsive handling, and value for money. Common complaints include its basic interior materials, limited engine power for highway passing, and relatively bland styling.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine hesitating upon acceleration, or even stalling completely, particularly at lower speeds or after idling. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the issue has been traced to faulty mass airflow sensor, clogged fuel injectors, or issues with the engine control unit (ECU) programming. Replacing the affected part, or reprogramming the ECU may fix the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerky acceleration, particularly at low speeds. Some have also reported transmission hesitation when accelerating from a stop, making the vehicle feel sluggish.
    *   Solution: Some have had luck with a software update to the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, a replacement of the CVT has been necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a system reboot or restart of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: The problem may be addressed with a software update to the infotainment system. If this does not fix it, replacing the unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,000+ (Replacement)

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a short period.
    *   Solution: Potential causes include a parasitic drain from an electrical component. Testing each circuit is required to determine the cause, and replacing that component to fix the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Rattling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises coming from the dashboard area, especially when driving on rough roads.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2022 Hyundai Accent generally experiences a few common issues, primarily related to the engine hesitations, and the CVT transmission's performance. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also reported. Interior rattling is another concern. While some issues are minor and easily resolved, engine and transmission problems can be more severe and costly to repair. It is important to note that many owners experience no issues. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and consider them during the purchasing process.
