**Engine**

**1.6L GDI Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls unexpectedly while driving, especially at lower speeds or when idling. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: Some owners have reported that cleaning the throttle body can alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, the fuel injectors or fuel pump may need to be replaced. A software update might also be available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable knocking or pinging sound coming from the engine, especially during acceleration. May be more pronounced when using lower octane fuel.
    *   Solution: Using higher octane fuel (as recommended in the owner's manual) can sometimes mitigate the issue. In some cases, it could indicate a more serious problem like carbon buildup or a faulty knock sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100+ (for fuel); $200 - $800+ (for sensor/cleaning)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable harsh shifting between gears, often accompanied by a jerking sensation. May be more pronounced during upshifts or downshifts.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and replacement with the correct fluid type (per Hyundai's specifications) may improve the issue. If the problem persists, it could indicate a valve body issue or internal wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush); $500 - $1500+ (valve body/internal repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hesitation/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed response when accelerating, or a feeling of the transmission "slipping" during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Initially, check the transmission fluid level and condition. If low or contaminated, a fluid change is recommended. More serious cases may require transmission repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid change); $1,500 - $3,500+ (repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking fluid observed on the rear shock absorbers, leading to reduced damping and a bouncy ride.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Noisy Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps.
