The 2010 Hyundai Accent is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It was available as a two-door hatchback and a four-door sedan. The engine options included a 1.6-liter inline-4 gasoline engine that produced 110 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices consisted of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Many owners appreciate the Accent's value proposition and ease of parking in urban environments. Common dislikes include its basic interior features, relatively modest acceleration, and sometimes rough ride quality compared to more modern vehicles.
