### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Hyundai Accent is a basic subcompact that offers affordability but comes with a set of common issues typical for its age and class. Engine-wise, oil leaks and timing belt concerns are notable, with the latter potentially causing significant damage if it fails. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, can experience wear, particularly the clutch in manuals and shifting problems in automatics. Suspension components like ball joints and struts are prone to wear, leading to ride quality and steering issues. Electrical problems, such as alternator failure and power window issues, are also reported. Exterior rust, especially in common areas, and interior issues like HVAC blower motor failure and dashboard cracking are also points to consider. Overall, while not a luxury vehicle, addressing these potential problems can maintain its functionality as a budget-friendly commuter.
