Here is a comprehensive list of issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2022 Hyundai Creta. The Creta is a subcompact SUV, available with two engine options: a 1.5L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing around 115 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque, paired with a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission), and a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 producing around 138 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed DCT (Dual Clutch Transmission). Owners generally appreciate the Creta's stylish design, comfortable ride, and feature-rich interior for its class. Common dislikes include perceived lack of performance with the 1.5L engine, occasional complaints about DCT behavior, and build quality concerns in some markets.

**Engine**

**1.5L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4 (CVT)**

* **Loss of Power/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a lack of power, especially during acceleration or when climbing hills. The CVT may struggle to find the optimal gear ratio, leading to hesitation.
    * Solution: In many cases, there is no specific "fix". Dealerships may recommend software updates to the ECU or CVT control module to improve responsiveness. Some owners resort to aftermarket performance chips or throttle controllers, but these solutions are not recommended by the manufacturer and could void warranty.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty. Aftermarket solutions vary in price.
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Turbocharged Inline-4 (7-Speed DCT)**

* **Turbo Lag**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay between pressing the accelerator and the engine responding, particularly at lower RPMs. This is inherent to turbocharged engines but can be more pronounced in some Creta models.
    * Solution: Similar to the 1.5L engine, there is often no definitive "fix" as it is characteristic of the engine design. Software updates to the ECU may help mitigate the issue to some extent.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Paired with 1.5L Engine)**

* **CVT Whine/Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive whining or humming noises from the CVT, especially during acceleration. This noise is generally considered normal for CVTs, but some find it obtrusive.
    * Solution: In most cases, the noise is considered normal operation. However, if the noise is excessively loud or accompanied by other symptoms (slipping, jerking), a CVT fluid change or CVT replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change - $100 - $300. CVT replacement - $3000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed DCT (Paired with 1.4L Turbo Engine)**

* **DCT Jerking/Hesitation at Low Speeds**
    * Description/Symptoms:  The DCT can exhibit jerky or hesitant behavior at low speeds, particularly in stop-and-go traffic. This is a common characteristic of DCTs, as they operate differently than traditional automatic transmissions.
    * Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes improve the shifting behavior. In some cases, replacing the clutch packs within the DCT may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty. Clutch pack replacement - $2000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This may require a system reset.
    * Solution: Software updates to the infotainment system are often released to address these issues. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty. Head unit replacement - $500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Door Panels**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report rattling noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels, especially when driving on rough roads.
    * Solution: Dealers may attempt to identify and secure the source of the rattle. This may involve adding padding or tightening fasteners.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable depending on the source and complexity of the rattle. Could range from minimal cost if DIY to several hundred dollars at a dealership.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Hyundai Creta generally has few major, widespread issues. The most common complaints revolve around the performance of the engines and transmissions, particularly the perceived lack of power with the 1.5L engine and the jerky behavior of the 7-speed DCT at low speeds. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and minor interior rattles are also reported. The severity of these issues varies, with some being minor annoyances and others requiring more substantial repairs. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive software updates to more costly transmission or infotainment system replacements. Overall, the Creta is a relatively reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
