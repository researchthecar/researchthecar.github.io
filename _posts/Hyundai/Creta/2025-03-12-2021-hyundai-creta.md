The 2021 Hyundai Creta is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency. Two engine options were available for the 2021 model year. The base engine is a 1.5L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 113 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, depending on the market. A more powerful option is a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 that produces 138 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners appreciate the Creta's modern interior, ample features for the price, and easy maneuverability. However, some criticisms include the relatively weak performance of the base engine, especially when fully loaded, and the occasionally sluggish response of the dual-clutch transmission.

**Engine**

**1.5L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Engine Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Louder than normal engine noise, especially during acceleration. This could be related to a lack of sound insulation, but some owners report it being more pronounced.
    *   Solution: Inspect exhaust and intake system. Consult Hyundai for potential sound deadening solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Turbo Lag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay in power delivery when accelerating, especially at lower RPMs. The turbocharger takes time to spool up, leading to a momentary hesitation.
    *   Solution: There is no mechanical fix for this issue. Software updates or learning to drive around the lag are possible mitigation strategies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update, if available)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 1.5L Engine)**

*   No Issues Found

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) (Paired with 1.4L Turbo Engine)**

*   **Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, especially at low speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. The dual-clutch transmission can sometimes struggle with smooth transitions between gears.
    *   Solution: Software updates may help improve shift quality. Transmission fluid service may also improve shift smoothness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update, if available), $100 - $300 (fluid service)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or creaking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect rear shock absorbers, sway bar links, and bushings for wear or damage. Replace worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the parts needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may experience occasional freezes, glitches, or slow response times. Issues with Bluetooth connectivity or navigation system errors have also been reported.
    *   Solution: Restart the infotainment system. Check for software updates. Take to a mechanic to check out the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update, if available), $100 - $1000+ (component replacement if necessary)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws (anything pulling power when the car is off). Replace battery if defective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (battery replacement), $100+ (diagnosing parasitic draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poor Quality Wiper Blades**
    *   Description/Symptoms: OEM wiper blades perform poorly and need to be replaced.
    *   Solution: Replace the OEM wiper blades.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20- $40
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises coming from the dashboard area, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and secure any loose components. Applying felt pads or foam tape can help dampen the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ (depending on complexity and if professional assistance is required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Hyundai Creta appears to have some common issues, including transmission issues when equipped with the DCT, suspension noises, and some electrical glitches. The severity of these issues varies, with some being minor annoyances and others requiring more substantial repairs. The estimated cost to fix these problems ranges from relatively inexpensive (software updates, wiper blades) to potentially more costly (suspension repairs, infotainment system replacement). Owners should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchase, especially if considering a model with the 1.4L turbo engine and DCT.
