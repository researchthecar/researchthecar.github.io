The 2001 Hyundai XG300 was a mid-size luxury sedan aimed at providing a comfortable and feature-rich experience at a competitive price point. The sole engine option for the 2001 XG300 was a 3.0L V6 engine producing approximately 192 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the XG300's smooth ride, spacious interior, and extensive list of standard features for the price. However, some common complaints included less-than-stellar fuel economy, a somewhat generic exterior design, and concerns about long-term reliability compared to established luxury brands.
