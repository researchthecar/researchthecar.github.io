## **2019 Hyundai Starex**

The 2019 Hyundai Starex is a spacious and versatile van offered with a choice of two engines: a 2.5-liter diesel engine producing 175 horsepower and 392 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4-liter gasoline engine producing 173 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission.

Owners of the Starex generally appreciate its practicality, affordability, and comfortable interior. However, there are some reported issues that affect its reliability.

### **Engine**

**2.5L Diesel Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail prematurely, leading to a loss of power and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling or whining noise, blue or black smoke from the exhaust, and decreased performance. The solution involves replacing the turbocharger, which can cost between $1,500 - $2,500+ for parts and labor.
* **Fuel Injector Issues:** Faulty fuel injectors can cause rough idling, poor fuel economy, and starting problems. The affected parts need to be diagnosed and replaced, with an approximate repair cost of $300 - $600+ per injector.
* **EGR Valve Malfunction:** The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve may malfunction, leading to increased emissions and reduced engine performance. Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve is necessary, which can cost around $200 - $500+.

**2.4L Gasoline Engine**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing a rattling noise and potential engine damage. Replacing the tensioner and timing chain is required, which can cost $1,000 - $2,000+ for parts and labor.
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A faulty intake manifold gasket can leak coolant, leading to overheating and poor engine performance. The gasket needs to be replaced, which can cost approximately $200 - $400+ for parts and labor.

### **Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Synchronizer Issues:** Worn or damaged synchronizers can make it difficult to shift gears smoothly. Replacing the synchronizers is necessary, which can cost around $500 - $1,000+ for parts and labor.
* **Clutch Problems:** The clutch may wear out prematurely, leading to slipping and difficulty engaging gears. Replacing the clutch kit is typically required, which can cost $600 - $1,200+ for parts and labor.

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** Leaking transmission fluid can cause shifting problems and potential transmission damage. Identifying and fixing the source of the leak is necessary, which can cost around $300 - $800+ for parts and labor.
* **Solenoid Issues:** Faulty solenoids can affect shift quality and may trigger the "Check Engine" light. Diagnosing and replacing the affected solenoids is required, which can cost $200 - $600+ for parts and labor.

### **Suspension**

* **Front Suspension Struts:** The front suspension struts can wear out prematurely, leading to a rough or bouncy ride. Replacing the strut assemblies is necessary, which can cost around $400 - $800+ per side for parts and labor.
* **Rear Leaf Springs:** The rear leaf springs can sag or break over time, affecting handling and ride quality. Replacing the leaf springs is required, which can cost $300 - $600+ per side for parts and labor.

### **Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Some vehicles may experience a battery drain issue, caused by a faulty module or electrical component. Diagnosing and repairing the electrical system is required, which can cost $200 - $600+ depending on the issue.
* **Alternator Failure:** A faulty alternator may not properly charge the battery, leading to electrical problems. Replacing the alternator typically costs around $400 - $800+ for parts and labor.

### **Exterior**

* **Door Lock Mechanism Failure:** The door lock mechanisms can fail, making it difficult to lock or unlock the doors. Replacing the affected lock actuators or switches is required, which can cost $200 - $400+ per door for parts and labor.
* **Body Rust:** Some owners have reported premature rust issues on the body panels, especially in areas exposed to salt or moisture. Body repair or replacement may be necessary, which can vary in cost depending on the extent of the damage.

### **Interior**

* **Dashboard Rattle:** A rattling noise from the dashboard may be caused by loose or defective components. Identifying and securing the affected parts is necessary, which can cost $100 - $300+ for labor.
* **Air Conditioning Issues:** The air conditioning system may not perform as expected, due to issues with the compressor, condenser, or other components. Diagnosing and repairing the affected part is required, which can cost $300 - $1,000+ depending on the issue.

### **Summary**

The 2019 Hyundai Starex is a spacious and practical vehicle, but it has some reported issues that affect its reliability. Engine problems, transmission issues, and suspension wear are among the most common concerns. Electrical problems, exterior issues, and interior rattles are also reported.

The severity of the issues varies, and some may be covered under warranty. However, some repairs can be costly, especially for engine or transmission failures, potentially impacting the overall value and ownership experience of the vehicle.
