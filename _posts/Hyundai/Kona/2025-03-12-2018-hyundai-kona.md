The 2018 Hyundai Kona is a subcompact SUV that offers a unique blend of style, practicality, and technology. Two engine options were available: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, and a more potent 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 generating 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L turbo engine uses a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners generally appreciate the Kona's agile handling, distinctive design, and user-friendly infotainment system. Criticisms often revolve around the limited rear passenger space and some reliability concerns.
