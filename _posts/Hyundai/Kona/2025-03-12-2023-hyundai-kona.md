The 2023 Hyundai Kona is a subcompact SUV known for its stylish design, nimble handling, and user-friendly technology. Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 (147 horsepower, 132 lb-ft of torque) and a turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 (195 horsepower, 195 lb-ft of torque). The 2.0L is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 1.6L Turbo is mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Kona's value, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability in urban environments. Common complaints revolve around a somewhat cramped rear seat and limited cargo space, as well as occasional concerns about the responsiveness of the base engine.

The severity and cost of these issues vary widely. While some problems can be resolved with simple fixes or software updates, others may require more extensive repairs, potentially involving significant expenses. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used Kona before purchasing.
