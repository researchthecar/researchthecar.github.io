Alright, here's a breakdown of potential issues with the 2024 Hyundai Kona, formatted as requested. It's important to remember that this is based on currently available information and real-world complaints that are still developing, as the 2024 model is relatively new. This list will likely evolve as more owners report their experiences.

The 2024 Hyundai Kona is a subcompact SUV offering a blend of practicality, style, and technology. It's available with two main engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine delivering 190 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The Kona is generally praised for its modern design, user-friendly infotainment system, and comfortable ride, though some find the base engine underpowered and the rear cargo space limited. Complaints typically center around initial build quality concerns and the occasional glitch with the infotainment.

**Summary**

The 2024 Hyundai Kona, while generally well-received, appears to have some initial build quality and electronic gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and connectivity.

The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs, depending on the root cause. Based on early reports, the majority of issues are considered to be on the lower side for repair costs and don't affect the functionality of the vehicle.
