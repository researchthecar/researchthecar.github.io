The 2022 Hyundai Kona is a subcompact SUV known for its stylish design, agile handling, and generous features for its class. It comes in several trims with two primary engine choices. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). An optional, more potent engine is a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 generating 195 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, matched with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Many owners appreciate the Kona's fuel efficiency, ease of parking, and user-friendly infotainment system. Conversely, some criticisms often revolve around the limited rear passenger space and the occasionally firm ride, especially on models with larger wheels.
