The 2021 Hyundai Kona is a subcompact SUV known for its stylish design, agile handling, and fuel efficiency. It was available with two gasoline engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Some owners appreciate the Kona's comfortable ride and abundance of technology, while others criticize its small rear seat space and some reported reliability issues, particularly with the dual-clutch transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can cause rough idling, poor acceleration, and a noticeable decrease in fuel economy. The check engine light may illuminate, and diagnostic codes related to misfires on specific cylinders (e.g., P0301, P0302) may be present.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the misfire, which could be due to faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors, or vacuum leaks. Replacing the faulty components and performing a compression test to rule out any cylinder damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component needing replaced
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil levels may drop significantly between oil changes, requiring frequent top-ups. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust during startup or acceleration may also be present.
    *   Solution: Hyundai has issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) regarding oil consumption issues in some of their engines. The solution often involves replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the engine bay, loss of power, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic codes related to turbocharger underboost or overboost may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger. It's crucial to diagnose the root cause of the failure, such as oil starvation or debris entering the turbo.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **Rough Shifting and Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or abrupt shifts, particularly at low speeds. Hesitation or delay in engagement when accelerating from a stop. Transmission may make clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes improve shift quality. In more severe cases, clutch replacement or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $6,000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may overheat, especially in stop-and-go traffic or during hot weather. The driver may notice reduced performance or an inability to shift gears. A warning light may illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Improve the DCT cooler system, or transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $6,000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

**Summary**

The 2021 Hyundai Kona has shown a few common issues that owners have experienced. The most prevalent and potentially expensive issues appear to be related to the 1.6L turbo engine, including excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failure. The 7-speed DCT is also a common source of complaints, with rough shifting and overheating being common problems. Electrical issues like infotainment system problems and battery drain can also occur. While not all Konas will experience these issues, it is important for potential buyers to be aware of them. Addressing these problems can range from relatively inexpensive software updates to costly engine or transmission repairs.
