The 2020 Hyundai Kona is a subcompact SUV known for its quirky styling, nimble handling, and available all-wheel drive. It offers two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and a turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 generating 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). People generally like the Kona for its value, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability, while some dislike its small rear seat and limited cargo space.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (with 6-Speed Automatic Transmission)**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine stalling, particularly at low speeds or when idling. This can occur intermittently and may be accompanied by a brief loss of power.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is needed to determine the cause of the stalling, which could range from a faulty sensor to a problem with the fuel system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbo Inline-4 (with 7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission)**

*   **Loss of Power/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience hesitation or a lack of power during acceleration. This may be more noticeable when the engine is cold or under heavy load. Some owners have reported the engine jerking or stumbling under light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Troubleshooting to identify the cause is necessary, which might involve checking the turbocharger, fuel injectors, or other engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **DCT Transmission Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, especially at low speeds. Some have noticed clunking sounds or vibrations during gear changes. This behavior is somewhat inherent to DCTs, but excessive roughness may indicate an issue.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) software update may alleviate some shifting issues. In severe cases, clutch replacement or transmission repair may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (software update); $1500 - $4000+ (clutch/transmission repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Paired with 2.0L Engine)**

No Issues Found

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) (Paired with 1.6L Turbo Engine)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint with DCTs is hesitation or jerking, especially during low-speed maneuvers or when starting from a stop. This is due to the nature of the dual-clutch design.
    *   Solution: While some of this behavior is inherent to the DCT design, software updates to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) can sometimes improve smoothness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (software update)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and other system functions.
    *   Solution: Try updating the infotainment system software. If the problem persists, a system reset or hardware replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update); $200 - $1000+ (hardware replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested for its ability to hold charge. If the battery is bad, it should be replaced. Also, check for parasitic drains.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (new battery); $100 - $200+ (diagnose parasitic drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Taillight Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracks appearing in the rear taillight lenses.
    *   Solution: Taillight lens replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises from various areas of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing the loose component, which could involve adding padding or tightening fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Hyundai Kona has a few common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine stalling and loss of power are possible concerns, particularly in the 1.6L turbo variant with the DCT, which can also exhibit rough shifting. Electrical issues like infotainment glitches and battery drain can be bothersome. The cost to address these issues can vary significantly, ranging from relatively inexpensive software updates to more costly engine or transmission repairs. While some issues are minor and easily fixed, others could lead to more substantial expenses. Overall, the 2020 Kona is generally considered a reliable vehicle, but it's wise to thoroughly inspect any used Kona and address any identified issues before purchase.
