**Summary**

While the 2024 Hyundai Palisade generally receives positive reviews, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues reported by owners.

Some issues are minor and easily addressed with software updates, while others may require more extensive (and costly) repairs. Proactive maintenance and addressing issues promptly can help to prevent more serious problems down the road.
