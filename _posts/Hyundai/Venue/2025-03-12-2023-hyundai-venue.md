The 2023 Hyundai Venue is a subcompact SUV known for its fuel efficiency, maneuverability, and affordability. All 2023 Venue models come standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 121 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Venue for its easy parking, user-friendly technology, and value. Common dislikes include its limited rear seat space, less-than-thrilling acceleration, and basic interior materials.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline 4-Cylinder**
* **Engine Misfires/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of engine misfires or hesitation, particularly during acceleration. This can manifest as a slight jerking or stumbling feeling. It may also cause the check engine light to illuminate.
    * Solution: Diagnosis typically involves checking spark plugs, ignition coils, and fuel injectors. A faulty ignition coil is the most common cause and replacement of the coil usually resolves the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the number of coils replaced and labor costs).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. It is important to note that this is not an exceedingly common complaint.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and using the manufacturer-recommended oil type and viscosity is important. Further diagnostics to check for leaks or internal engine issues (like worn piston rings) may be necessary. In rare instances, internal engine repair or replacement might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for oil change) - $1,000+ (for more extensive repairs).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Jerky Acceleration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported jerky acceleration or a feeling of hesitation when accelerating, especially at lower speeds. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: In some cases, the issue can be resolved by resetting the transmission control module (TCM) or performing a CVT fluid flush. If the problem persists, a TCM replacement or complete transmission replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (for TCM reset/fluid flush), $500 - $1,500+ (for TCM replacement), $3,000 - $5,000+ (for transmission replacement).
