The 2024 Hyundai Venue is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and user-friendly technology. It offers a single engine option: a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 121 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Venue's maneuverability in urban environments and its comprehensive suite of standard safety features. Criticisms often focus on the engine's modest power, which can feel strained during highway driving, and the limited cargo space compared to some competitors.
