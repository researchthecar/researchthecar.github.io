The 2020 Hyundai Venue is a subcompact crossover known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and city-friendly maneuverability. It comes standard with a 1.6L Smartstream G1.6 four-cylinder engine producing 121 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission (base SE model only) or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), which is the more common configuration. Owners often praise its stylish design, user-friendly technology, and comfortable interior for its class. Common complaints include limited cargo space, a somewhat underpowered engine, and road noise at higher speeds.

**Engine**

**1.6L Smartstream G1.6**

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine stalling, hesitating upon acceleration, or exhibiting rough idling, especially in colder weather or shortly after starting. This can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update for the Engine Control Unit (ECU) can address the issue. It may also be related to the Mass Airflow Sensor, Throttle Position Sensor, or fuel injectors. In worst cases, it is a faulty fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the failed component
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 1.6L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil. This is generally noticed by having to add oil much more frequently than normal, or seeing the low oil light come on. In some cases, it has led to engine damage due to insufficient lubrication.
    *   Solution: A possible solution may be replacing piston rings and/or addressing valve seal issues to prevent oil from entering the combustion chamber. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Intelligent Variable Transmission (IVT)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have described experiencing jerky or uneven acceleration, especially at lower speeds, and occasionally harsh shifting. The IVT, designed for smooth transitions, may exhibit unnatural behavior.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) software update may help smooth out the transmission behavior. In more severe cases, replacement of the transmission control module or complete transmission replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+ depending on repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may include issues with the touchscreen, navigation, or audio system.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, replacing the infotainment unit is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (replacement unit)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature battery drain, resulting in difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws from aftermarket accessories, faulty wiring, or a failing alternator. Replacing the battery is a common initial step, but addressing the underlying cause is essential.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (battery replacement) - $500+ (diagnosing and fixing electrical draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Instances of the AEB system activating unnecessarily, even without an obstruction or pedestrian present. This can be both alarming and dangerous.
    *   Solution: Calibration of the AEB sensors or replacement of a faulty AEB sensor or control module. Ensure the front sensor is clear of obstructions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1,000+ depending on the replacement or repair needed
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the AC system blowing warm air, indicating a potential issue with the compressor, refrigerant leak, or other components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the AC failure and repair or replace the faulty component (compressor, condenser, evaporator, etc.). A refrigerant recharge may also be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the failed component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Hyundai Venue, while generally a reliable and affordable vehicle, does exhibit some common issues. Engine-related problems such as stalling and oil consumption, as well as transmission concerns like jerky shifting, can be potentially costly to repair. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and battery drain are also fairly common. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and thoroughly inspect any prospective vehicle before purchasing.
