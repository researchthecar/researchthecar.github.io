The 2021 Hyundai Venue is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and ease of parking. It is powered by a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing 121 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate the Venue's nimble handling and standard features, but some dislike its limited cargo space and relatively slow acceleration.
