The 2022 Hyundai Venue is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability, making it a popular choice for city dwellers and first-time car buyers. It is only available with one engine option, a 1.6-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 121 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque, which is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate its compact size, easy parking, and generous standard features. Common complaints include limited rear passenger space, modest acceleration, and some concerns about the CVT's performance.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a knocking or pinging sound coming from the engine, especially during acceleration or when using lower-octane fuel. This can indicate pre-ignition or detonation, potentially leading to engine damage over time.
    *   Solution: The problem may be caused by carbon buildup, improper fuel mixture, or a faulty knock sensor. Try using higher-octane fuel or having the dealer check for software updates or other engine-related issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have observed that their Venue consumes an unusual amount of engine oil between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and the need for frequent top-offs.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly, check for leaks, and consult a mechanic to determine the cause. It is possible that the valve stem seals or piston rings are worn out.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1,500+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly from a standstill or at lower speeds. This can make the vehicle feel unresponsive or unstable.
    *   Solution: Some owners have reported improvement after a CVT software update from the dealer. In other cases, the CVT may need to be replaced if the issues persist.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) - $4,000+ (for CVT replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or humming noise emanating from the transmission, especially during acceleration or at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by worn CVT components or low fluid levels, which leads to noise. The first step is to inspect the fluid level and inspect the fluid. If the noise persists, the transmission may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Fluid change) - $4,000+ (for CVT replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Try restarting the system or checking for software updates. If the issue persists, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $500+ (for infotainment unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera. Image distortion, black screen, or no display when the vehicle is in reverse.
