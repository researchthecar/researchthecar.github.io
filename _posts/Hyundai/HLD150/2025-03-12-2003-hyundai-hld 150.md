The 2003 Hyundai Elantra (XD generation) is a compact car known for its affordability and practicality. It was offered with two main engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 gasoline engine, and a 1.8-liter inline-4 gasoline engine. The 2.0L engine produced approximately 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Elantra's fuel efficiency and roomy interior for its class. Common complaints often revolve around the car's somewhat bland styling and less-than-exciting driving dynamics. Over time, issues related to age and wear are prevalent.

**Summary**

The 2003 Hyundai Elantra, while generally reliable for its time, is now prone to issues associated with age and wear. Engine problems can range from minor sensor failures to more significant valve cover leaks. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can be expensive to repair. Suspension components like struts and springs will likely need replacement on older models. Electrical gremlins such as power window and turn signal switch failures are also common. Rust is a significant concern, especially in colder climates. While individual repair costs may be relatively low for some issues, the cumulative effect of these age-related problems can make ownership more costly over time.
