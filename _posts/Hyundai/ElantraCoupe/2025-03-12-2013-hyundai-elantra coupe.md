The 2013 Hyundai Elantra Coupe is a two-door compact car that offered a sportier alternative to the Elantra sedan. The 2013 Elantra Coupe had only one engine option: a 1.8-liter inline-4 cylinder engine, producing 148 horsepower and 131 lb-ft of torque. It came standard with a 6-speed manual transmission, with a 6-speed automatic transmission available as an option. Owners often appreciated the Elantra Coupe's fuel efficiency, stylish design, and value for the money. However, common complaints included road noise, a somewhat lackluster driving experience, and some reliability concerns.
