The 2016 Hyundai HD65 is a light-duty truck primarily used for commercial purposes. Itâ€™s known for its reliability and practicality as a workhorse vehicle. The HD65 typically comes with a diesel engine, specifically the D4GA engine which is offered in varying output ratings depending on the market. This engine produces around 150 horsepower and approximately 400 Nm of torque. While owners generally appreciate the HD65 for its robustness and cargo capacity, some common complaints revolve around the ride quality and fuel efficiency relative to newer, more technologically advanced trucks. The available transmission is a 5-speed manual.

**Engine**

**D4GA Diesel Engine**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, rough idling, black smoke from exhaust, decreased fuel economy, and engine misfires. This can be caused by dirty fuel or a faulty injector.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis through OBDII scanner. Replacement of faulty fuel injector(s). Cleaning of fuel system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector (includes labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, loud whining noise from the engine bay, and the engine entering limp mode.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm turbocharger failure. Replacement of the turbocharger unit, including necessary gaskets and oil lines. Inspection of intercooler for oil accumulation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ (includes labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting/Grinding Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Resistance when shifting gears, grinding noise when engaging gears, especially 2nd and 3rd gears, and potential gear slippage. Could be caused by worn synchronizers or clutch issues.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the clutch system (master cylinder, slave cylinder, clutch disc, pressure plate). Replacement of worn synchronizers or the entire gear set if damage is extensive. Gear oil change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ (depending on severity and parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty engaging gears, high engagement point, and unusual noises when pressing the clutch pedal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and release bearing. Resurfacing or replacement of the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1500 (includes labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, especially under load, uneven stance, and visible cracks or damage to the leaf springs. Affects load-carrying capacity and ride comfort.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf spring pack(s). Inspection and replacement of U-bolts and spring bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200 per spring (includes labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, longer stopping distances, and visible oil leaks from the shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shock absorbers. Inspection of suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 (includes labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the vehicle, especially in cold weather, requiring frequent jump starts, and dimming headlights. Can be caused by a parasitic drain.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic drain. Repair or replacement of faulty components (e.g., alternator, starter, relays, or wiring).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard, battery not charging, and eventually, the vehicle stalling.
    *   Solution: Testing the alternator's output. Replacement of the alternator unit. Inspection of the battery and charging system wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (includes labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on body panels, especially in areas prone to moisture and salt exposure (e.g., wheel wells, undercarriage, and seams).
    *   Solution: Thorough cleaning and rust removal. Application of rust converter and primer. Repainting the affected area. In severe cases, panel replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor not working, resulting in no airflow from the vents, or inconsistent airflow. Can be caused by a faulty blower motor or resistor.
    *   Solution: Testing the blower motor and resistor. Replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 (includes labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Hyundai HD65, while a reliable work truck, does have some common issues. The most prevalent problems appear to be related to the D4GA diesel engine, specifically fuel injector and turbocharger failures, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with shifting and the clutch, are also reported. Suspension problems, especially related to leaf springs, affect ride quality and load-carrying capacity. Electrical issues with the battery and alternator can also occur. Rusting, especially in harsh environments, is a concern for the exterior. Overall, potential buyers should pay close attention to the engine's condition, clutch and transmission operation, and any signs of rust when inspecting a used 2016 HD65. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls.
