Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2021 Hyundai Nexo, categorized by major components.

The 2021 Hyundai Nexo is a fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV), praised for its futuristic design, long driving range, and comfortable ride. It boasts a 120 kW (161 hp) electric motor producing 291 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate its zero-emission driving and advanced technology, but some express concerns about the limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure and the higher initial cost compared to conventional vehicles. The Nexo only has one motor/transmission configuration.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances where the Nexo enters "turtle mode" or experiences significantly reduced power output, even with a sufficient hydrogen fuel level. This can occur under various driving conditions and is often accompanied by warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: This issue often requires a diagnostic check by a certified Hyundai technician. The issue could stem from multiple parts. Often the issue is related to the high-voltage system, and a software update or component replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnostic fee: $100-200. Repair cost depends on the faulty part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**High Voltage Battery**

*   **High Voltage Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A small number of owners have reported the high-voltage battery failing completely or exhibiting significantly reduced capacity. This can result in the vehicle being unable to start or having a drastically reduced driving range.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-voltage battery pack is the only solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $15,000+ (including labor). Battery replacements are generally covered by Hyundai's warranty, but out-of-warranty repairs are expensive.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven road surfaces.
    *   Solution: The cause is the rear shock absorbers or stabilizer bar links. Replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300- $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: A software update can sometimes resolve this issue, but if the problem persists, the infotainment system may need to be replaced.

*   **Hydrogen Fuel Door Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Issues with the hydrogen fuel door not opening or closing properly have been reported. This can prevent refueling or create aerodynamic drag while driving.
    * Solution: This is often due to a faulty actuator or sensor in the fuel door mechanism. Replacement of the faulty component is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Hyundai Nexo, while innovative and environmentally friendly, does experience some issues. The most concerning are related to the high-voltage battery and motor, which can be costly to repair if not covered by warranty. Electrical glitches and suspension noises are also common complaints. While the frequency of these issues seems relatively low, potential buyers should be aware of these possibilities and ensure they have access to a reliable Hyundai service center experienced with fuel-cell vehicles. The overall severity of the issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially significant repair expenses.
