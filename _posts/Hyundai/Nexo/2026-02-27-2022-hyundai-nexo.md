# 2022 Hyundai Nexo

### Overview
The 2022 Hyundai Nexo is a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) that represents a significant step in alternative fuel technology. As a relatively new powertrain for mass production, its reliability is closely watched. While FCEVs generally offer a simpler mechanical design compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (fewer moving parts, no oil changes, etc.), the complexity lies in the fuel cell stack, hydrogen storage, and associated high-pressure systems. Early data suggests a promising start for the Nexo, with owners generally reporting positive experiences regarding its core functionality and the innovative powertrain. However, as with any advanced technology, long-term durability and the availability of specialized repair infrastructure remain key considerations for potential buyers and fleet operators.

### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Hyundai Nexo demonstrates strong initial reliability, particularly concerning its groundbreaking hydrogen fuel cell powertrain. The core components of the FCEV system have shown no significant widespread issues, which is a positive indicator for this advanced technology. Minor concerns are primarily related to the infotainment system's software, which is common across many modern vehicles and typically resolved with updates. The lack of widespread mechanical issues in traditional areas like the engine and transmission is a testament to the inherent simplicity of electric drivetrains. Overall, the Nexo appears to be a reliable option for those seeking cutting-edge, zero-emission transportation, though long-term durability and the specialized nature of FCEV repairs should be considered.
