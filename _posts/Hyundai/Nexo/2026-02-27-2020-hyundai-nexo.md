# 2020 Hyundai Nexo

### Overview
The 2020 Hyundai Nexo is a cutting-edge hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) designed for zero-emission driving. As a relatively new technology in the mainstream automotive market, its long-term reliability is still being established. However, initial data suggests a strong performance, particularly in its powertrain components, which are less complex than traditional internal combustion engines. The Nexo aims to provide a sustainable and advanced driving experience, focusing on innovative technology and environmental consciousness. While the core fuel cell system has shown promise, like any advanced vehicle, potential owners should be aware of the specific maintenance requirements and the developing infrastructure for hydrogen refueling.
