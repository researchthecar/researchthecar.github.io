The 2024 Hyundai Nexo is a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), powered solely by hydrogen. It boasts a 120 kW (161 hp) electric motor with 291 lb-ft of torque. There are no other engine or transmission options available. The Nexo is praised for its quiet and smooth ride, innovative technology, and long driving range (estimated at 380 miles). Common dislikes include limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure and the higher price point compared to traditional gasoline vehicles or battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

**Electric Motor**

*   **Electric Motor Power Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden and unexpected loss of power from the electric motor. This can occur during acceleration or while maintaining a constant speed. Some owners report the vehicle entering a "limp mode" with severely reduced power.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a certified Hyundai technician using specialized diagnostic tools to identify the root cause, which could range from a faulty inverter, motor controller, or issues within the fuel cell system itself. Depending on the diagnosis, solutions may include software updates, component replacement (e.g., inverter, motor controller), or fuel cell system repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the cause. Software updates may be free. Component replacement could range from $500 to $5,000+, with fuel cell system repairs potentially costing even more.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical System**

*   **12V Battery Drainage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, which supports auxiliary systems like lights and accessories, drains rapidly, particularly if the vehicle is left unused for a few days. This can lead to starting problems or the inability to use certain vehicle features.
    *   Solution: Inspect for parasitic drains (e.g., aftermarket accessories drawing power when the vehicle is off). A faulty battery management system (BMS) could also be a cause. Replacement of the 12V battery or repair/replacement of the BMS may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: 12V Battery Replacement: $100 - $300. BMS Repair/Replacement: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system becomes unresponsive, freezes, or crashes unexpectedly. This may affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other integrated functions.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. If the problem persists, a software update may be necessary. In some cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (often free), Infotainment unit replacement: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Hydrogen Fuel Door Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hydrogen fuel door (the door that covers the hydrogen refueling port) may fail to open or close properly. This can be due to a faulty latch mechanism, actuator motor, or issues with the door sensor.
    *   Solution: Inspect the latch mechanism for obstructions or damage. Lubricate the latch. If the problem persists, the actuator motor or the entire fuel door assembly may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Actuator Motor Replacement: $200 - $500. Fuel Door Assembly Replacement: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters fail to operate, or provide inconsistent heating. This may affect only one seat or multiple seats.
    *   Solution: Check the seat heater wiring and connections for damage or loose connections. The seat heater element or the seat heater control module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Seat Heater Element Replacement: $200 - $600+ per seat. Control Module Replacement: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2024 Hyundai Nexo, while innovative and environmentally friendly, does present a few potential issues for owners. The most concerning is the potential for electric motor power loss, which could significantly impact the driving experience and necessitate costly repairs. Electrical issues, such as 12V battery drainage and infotainment system problems, are also noteworthy. Other issues like the fuel door malfunction and seat heater failures are less severe but can still be frustrating for owners. Overall, while not extensive, the list of potential problems suggests prospective buyers should be aware of the possible repair costs associated with the Nexo's unique fuel cell technology and electrical systems.
