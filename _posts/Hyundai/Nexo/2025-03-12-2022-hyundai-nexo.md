The 2022 Hyundai Nexo is a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). It's powered by a fuel cell stack that combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, with water as the only emission. The Nexo boasts an estimated range of 380 miles. The Nexo offers features such as a spacious and well-appointed interior, advanced safety technology, and a smooth, quiet ride. However, its limited availability due to the scarcity of hydrogen refueling stations and the higher upfront cost compared to traditional gasoline vehicles or battery electric vehicles are often cited as drawbacks.

**Fuel Cell Stack and Electric Motor**

*   **Fuel Cell Stack Degradation/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature degradation or failure of the fuel cell stack is a potential issue. Symptoms can include reduced range, decreased power output, and error messages related to the fuel cell system. This could stem from fuel contamination, improper maintenance, or inherent design limitations.
    *   Solution: Requires diagnosis and repair or replacement of the fuel cell stack by a certified Hyundai technician familiar with FCEV systems. Regular maintenance and following Hyundai's recommendations for fuel quality are important preventative measures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Substantially high due to the specialized components and labor involved. Replacement of the fuel cell stack could easily exceed $10,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Electric Motor Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electric motor itself, while generally reliable, can experience issues such as bearing failure or winding damage. These problems can lead to unusual noises, reduced power, or complete motor failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of the electric motor by a qualified technician.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether the motor can be rebuilt or needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**High Voltage System**

*   **High Voltage Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: While fuel cells power the car, a high-voltage battery is still used. Degradation may occur resulting in reduced range or performance.
    * Solution: Battery replacement or module replacement depending on the specific issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Software Glitches/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or unresponsive infotainment screens are reported. Some users have experienced intermittent issues with the driver assistance systems.
    *   Solution: Software updates or module replacements might fix these issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on whether the issue is resolved through software or hardware replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2022 Hyundai Nexo, while innovative and environmentally friendly, can be subject to issues with the fuel cell stack, electric motor, and electrical systems. The most concerning is the potential for fuel cell stack degradation or failure, which can be extremely costly to repair. Electrical glitches in the infotainment system are less severe but can still be frustrating. The limited availability of hydrogen infrastructure makes owning a Nexo practical only in certain regions.
