The 2019 Hyundai Nexo is a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) powered by a hydrogen fuel cell stack that produces electricity to power an electric motor. It has a single electric motor that produces 161 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque. There are no other engine or transmission options for the 2019 Nexo. Owners often praise the Nexo for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and impressive range for a fuel cell vehicle. Common complaints include the limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure, the higher purchase price compared to battery electric vehicles, and the somewhat bland interior design.
