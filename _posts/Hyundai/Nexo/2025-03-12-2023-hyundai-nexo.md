The 2023 Hyundai Nexo is a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), powered by a 95 kW (127 hp) electric motor and producing 291 lb-ft of torque. The Nexo only has one powertrain configuration, making it simpler to analyze common issues. Owners generally praise the Nexo for its futuristic technology, quiet and smooth ride, and zero tailpipe emissions. Some common dislikes include limited hydrogen refueling infrastructure and the higher initial cost compared to traditional gasoline vehicles or battery-electric vehicles.

**Electric Motor**

*No Issues Found*

**Battery**

*No Issues Found*

**Fuel Cell System**

*   **Hydrogen Fuel Cell Stack Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature degradation of the fuel cell stack, leading to reduced range, decreased performance, and potential failure to start. Error codes related to fuel cell efficiency may also appear. This is a long-term concern rather than an immediate failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel cell stack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20,000+ (Fuel cell stacks are expensive and require specialized technicians)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydrogen Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Detection of hydrogen leaks from the fuel cell system or hydrogen storage tanks. This can be detected by a noticeable hydrogen smell or via sensors in the car that trigger a warning light or error message. Hydrogen is highly flammable and thus leaks are a safety risk.
    *   Solution: Locating and repairing the leak (e.g., replacing a faulty valve, tightening a connection, or replacing a damaged section of the hydrogen storage tank).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (Depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*No Issues Found*

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software update or replacement of the infotainment system unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,500+ (Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery, which powers accessories and provides initial power for starting the vehicle, can drain prematurely, leading to a dead battery and inability to start the car. This may be due to a parasitic drain from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve replacing a faulty sensor, module, or wiring harness. Alternatively, the 12V battery itself may be defective and needs replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Battery Replacement) - $500+ (Diagnosing and repairing parasitic drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the blind spot monitoring system or parking sensors to function correctly. This can be due to sensor damage, misalignment, or electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing or realigning the affected sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor (includes labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters fail to heat, or only heat intermittently. This may be due to a faulty heating element or a wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating element or repairing the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per seat
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Hyundai Nexo, while lauded for its innovative technology and eco-friendliness, may present potential issues, the most concerning being premature fuel cell degradation and hydrogen leaks, which can be very costly to repair. While not frequent, electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system, and sensor malfunctions are also potential concerns. The severity of these issues ranges from inconvenient (infotainment system) to potentially dangerous (hydrogen leaks). Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of the long-term maintenance costs associated with fuel cell technology and the potential for expensive repairs.
