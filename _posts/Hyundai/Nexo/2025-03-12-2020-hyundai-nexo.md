The 2020 Hyundai Nexo is a fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) powered by a hydrogen fuel cell system. It produces 161 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque. There are no other engine or transmission options available as it is solely powered by a hydrogen fuel cell and an electric motor. The Nexo is liked for its futuristic design, quiet and smooth ride, and zero tailpipe emissions. Some common dislikes include the limited availability of hydrogen refueling stations and the higher initial cost compared to gasoline vehicles.

**Electric Motor**

* **Electric Motor**
    * **Reduced power/turtle mode**
        * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle enters a "turtle mode" or reduced power mode, often accompanied by warning lights. This can occur under heavy acceleration or sustained high-speed driving, particularly when the hydrogen fuel cell system is under high load. The vehicle may also display a "Check Electric System" or similar error message.
        * Solution: Addressing this issue can involve several steps. Firstly, inspect the hydrogen fuel cell system and related components for any leaks or damage. Secondly, ensure that the hydrogen fuel cell system has adequate cooling. Lastly, ensure all sensors related to the fuel cell stack is functioning correctly. In some cases, a software update may be required to optimize the fuel cell system's performance.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the cause.
        * Recalls: None Found

**Fuel Cell System**

* **Hydrogen Fuel Cell System**
    * **Hydrogen Leakage**
        * Description/Symptoms: Hydrogen leakage from the fuel cell system. This can be detected by a strong odor of gas around the vehicle. It may also trigger the "Check Fuel Cell System" warning light. This is a critical safety concern.
        * Solution: Locating and repairing the source of the leak is the solution to the problem. This will involve a thorough inspection of the hydrogen storage tanks, fuel cell stack, and related plumbing. Damaged components need to be replaced, and any leaks need to be properly sealed.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
        * Recalls: None Found

* **Hydrogen Fuel Cell System**
    * **Fuel Cell Stack Degradation**
        * Description/Symptoms: Gradual decline in the performance of the fuel cell stack over time. The vehicle may experience reduced range, slower acceleration, and decreased overall power output.
        * Solution: Replacement of the fuel cell stack, which is an expensive repair. Alternative solutions may involve cleaning or refurbishing the existing fuel cell stack, but the effectiveness of these options is not guaranteed.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000 - $20,000+
        * Recalls: None Found

**Battery System**

* **Lithium-ion Battery Pack**
    * **Battery Degradation/Reduced Range**
        * Description/Symptoms: Reduction in battery capacity over time, resulting in reduced range. This is a normal phenomenon in electric vehicles, but some owners may experience a more significant decline than expected.
        * Solution: Battery management system (BMS) recalibration can improve range if the battery cells are in good health. Battery module replacement or full battery pack replacement is the only option if the cells have significant degradation.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $15,000+ depending on whether individual modules or the entire pack needs replacement.
        * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Electrical System**
    * **12V Battery Drain**
        * Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the 12V auxiliary battery, often resulting in the vehicle being unable to start or exhibiting electrical issues. This can be caused by parasitic drain or a faulty charging system.
        * Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the source of the parasitic drain. Replacing the 12V battery with a new, high-quality unit.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement and diagnostic fees.
        * Recalls: None Found

* **Electrical System**
    * **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
        * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect access to navigation, audio, and vehicle settings.
        * Solution: Performing a software update, if available. Resetting the infotainment system. In severe cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,500+ depending on whether a software update fixes the issue or unit replacement is needed.
        * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Interior Electronics**
    * **Digital Gauge Cluster Issues**
        * Description/Symptoms: The digital gauge cluster (instrument panel) may experience flickering, dimming, or complete failure. This can make it difficult to monitor vehicle speed, battery level, and other critical information.
        * Solution: The gauge cluster may need to be recalibrated or replaced.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
        * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Exterior Components**
    * **Sensor Malfunctions (parking sensors, blind spot monitoring)**
        * Description/Symptoms: The sensors may generate false alarms, fail to detect obstacles, or become completely inoperative. This can compromise the vehicle's safety features.
        * Solution: Inspecting and cleaning the sensors to ensure they are free from dirt, debris, and obstructions. Replacing faulty sensors as needed. Calibrating the sensor system after replacement.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, plus calibration costs.
        * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Hyundai Nexo, while innovative, has experienced some issues centered around its hydrogen fuel cell and electrical systems. The hydrogen fuel cell issues such as hydrogen leakage and fuel cell stack degradation are the most severe and costly to repair. Electrical issues like 12V battery drain and infotainment system malfunctions are also common complaints. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to upwards of $20,000 depending on the issue. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and ensure proper maintenance and inspections are performed to mitigate risks.
