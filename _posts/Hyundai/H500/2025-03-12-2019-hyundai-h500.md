Okay, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Hyundai Kona, organized by category and component, following your specified format.  Please note that this is based on commonly reported issues, technical service bulletins (TSBs), and recall data available as of my last update. Actual experiences can vary.  Information regarding trim levels and drivetrain configurations can affect the frequency and nature of specific issues. The Hyundai Kona is a subcompact SUV. For 2019, engine options include a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L is typically paired with a six-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L turbo is paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). The Kona is generally praised for its nimble handling, distinctive styling, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints revolve around its relatively small rear seat space and limited cargo capacity, especially compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (MPi)**

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report instances of engine stalling at low speeds, particularly when coming to a stop. Others describe hesitation or a lag in acceleration, especially during initial throttle application. Symptoms can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics may include checking the mass airflow sensor (MAF), throttle body, fuel injectors, and the engine control unit (ECU) software. Some dealers may recommend an ECU reflash or replacement of the faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, needing to add oil more frequently than normal between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: Check for oil leaks around the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. A compression test and cylinder leak-down test can help determine if the issue is internal (e.g., piston rings). The dealership may perform an oil consumption test to determine if the consumption is within acceptable limits (as defined by Hyundai). For excessive consumption, repairs may involve replacing piston rings or other internal engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and components replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4 (GDI)**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, whistling or whining noises from the turbocharger area, check engine light illumination (often related to turbocharger boost pressure or wastegate control). Some owners experience turbocharger failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the turbocharger system for leaks, damaged hoses, and proper wastegate operation. A faulty turbocharger may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup (GDI Engine)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, reduced fuel economy, hesitation during acceleration, and a check engine light. GDI (Gasoline Direct Injection) engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves due to the lack of fuel washing over them.
    *   Solution: Perform an intake valve cleaning service. This can involve walnut blasting, chemical cleaning, or other methods to remove carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) - (1.6L Turbo Models)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint with DCTs, this manifests as hesitation or jerky movements during initial acceleration, particularly in stop-and-go traffic. The transmission may feel "clunky" or "unrefined" at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Some dealers may recommend a DCT software update to improve shift quality. In some cases, clutch replacement may be necessary, although this is typically only required after significant mileage or aggressive driving.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: $100-$200, Clutch Replacement: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Gear Slippage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission will not engage gear correctly at times, causing gear slippage or failure to accelerate.
    * Solution: The DCT clutch actuator motor may need to be replaced
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report clunking or rattling noises from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rear shock absorbers, sway bar links, and bushings for wear or damage. Replacing worn components can resolve the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the parts needing replacement and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation issues. The infotainment system can be slow to respond or crash intermittently.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset (if available). Check for software updates and install the latest version. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $0 (if DIY), $50-$150 (at dealer). Head unit replacement: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. The car may be difficult to start or require a jump start.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic drains by testing the current draw when the car is off. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a malfunctioning body control module (BCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Seat Upholstery Wear/Tearing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners, especially those with cloth seats, have reported premature wear or tearing of the seat upholstery, particularly on the driver's seat.
    *   Solution: Seat covers can protect the upholstery. If the damage is significant, reupholstering or replacing the seat may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the sunroof gets stuck when trying to open or close, makes loud noises, or leaks water.
    *   Solution: Inspect sunroof track and seals. Check sunroof motor and replace if needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Hyundai Kona, particularly with the 1.6L turbo engine and DCT, may experience issues related to transmission smoothness, turbocharger reliability, and carbon buildup. The 2.0L engine can suffer from excessive oil consumption and stalling issues. Electrical gremlins in the infotainment system are also reported. While some issues like carbon buildup and DCT hesitation are common in similar vehicles, the turbocharger and electrical problems could lead to more significant repair costs. The severity of issues varies, but it's essential to be aware of these potential problems when considering a used 2019 Kona.
