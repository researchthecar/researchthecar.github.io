Here's a comprehensive overview of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2018 Hyundai Kona, broken down by category and engine/transmission options. Note that this information is based on publicly available reports and owner experiences, and individual vehicle issues can vary.

The 2018 Hyundai Kona is a subcompact SUV known for its stylish design, agile handling, and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-4, producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4, generating 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were front-wheel drive standard, with all-wheel drive being available. The 2.0L engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L turbo was paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners generally appreciate the Kona's value, maneuverability, and technology features. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space and some concerns about the long-term reliability of the DCT transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (147 hp, 132 lb-ft)**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly while driving or at idle. This issue has been reported to happen randomly and has been attributed to a variety of causes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking for fault codes, inspecting the fuel system, and potentially replacing sensors (crankshaft position sensor, mass airflow sensor). A software update from the manufacturer may also be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between service intervals.
    *   Solution: Perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of oil loss. If excessive, possible causes include worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or PCV valve issues. Repair may involve replacing these components or, in severe cases, an engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**1.6L Turbo Inline-4 (175 hp, 195 lb-ft)**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine exhibits knocking or pinging sounds, especially under acceleration or load. This could indicate issues with fuel quality, improper combustion, or pre-ignition.
    *   Solution: Try using premium fuel with a higher octane rating. If the problem persists, inspect for carbon buildup, check the ignition system, and ensure proper engine timing. A software update may also be available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.0L Engine)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or jerky shifting between gears. This can manifest as a noticeable shudder or lurch during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush may resolve the issue. If not, further diagnosis might involve inspecting the valve body or solenoids within the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) (Paired with 1.6L Turbo Engine)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DCT transmission can exhibit hesitation or jerking, especially at low speeds, during stop-and-go traffic, or when starting from a standstill. This is a common characteristic of dual-clutch transmissions.
    *   Solution: Some improvement may be achieved through transmission software updates. In more severe cases, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: “None Found”
*   **Transmission Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may overheat during extended periods of driving in stop-and-go traffic or on hills. A warning light may illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Allow the transmission to cool down. Ensure the transmission cooler is functioning correctly. In some cases, a transmission fluid change with a higher-quality fluid may help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: “None Found”

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains prematurely, leading to difficulty starting the engine, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for an extended period.
    *   Solution: Conduct a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator. Replace the defective component or disconnect the accessory.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: “None Found”
*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or exhibit glitches. These issues can affect navigation, audio, and other connected features.
    *   Solution: Try a soft reset of the system. Check for software updates from the manufacturer. If the problem persists, a replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
