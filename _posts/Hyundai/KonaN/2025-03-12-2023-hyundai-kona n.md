The 2023 Hyundai Kona N is a high-performance subcompact SUV that's known for its fun-to-drive nature and sporty styling. It comes exclusively with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 276 horsepower and 289 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). It is only offered in front-wheel-drive. Owners appreciate the Kona N's responsive engine, sharp handling, and relatively affordable price point. Common complaints revolve around the stiff ride quality, limited cargo space, and somewhat polarizing styling.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be indicated by the low oil light illuminating or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Some have had success with changing to a higher viscosity oil. Others have required engine repairs or replacement depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $8,000+

    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the DCT can exhibit rough or jerky shifting, particularly at low speeds or during stop-and-go traffic.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) or clutch relearn procedure. In some cases, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+

    *   Description/Symptoms: The Kona N's suspension, while contributing to its sporty handling, can be harsh over rough roads, leading to discomfort for some occupants.
    *   Solution: There is no easy solution for this issue, as it is inherent to the vehicle's design. Some owners consider aftermarket suspension modifications, but this can affect handling and potentially void warranty coverage.

**Summary**

The 2023 Hyundai Kona N is a generally reliable vehicle with a few common issues. The most concerning are the potential engine issues (oil consumption, turbo failure) and transmission problems (rough shifting, slippage) due to their potential impact on performance and repair costs. Electrical glitches and interior rattles are less severe but can still be frustrating for owners. Before purchasing a used Kona N, it is important to obtain a thorough pre-purchase inspection and check the vehicle's service history to identify and address any potential problems.
