The 2022 Hyundai Kona N is a performance-oriented subcompact SUV, known for its engaging driving dynamics and distinctive styling. This high-performance variant of the Kona is powered exclusively by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 276 horsepower and 289 lb-ft of torque. It comes exclusively with an eight-speed wet dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Common praises include the Kona N's responsive handling, potent engine, and aggressive looks. Criticisms often target the firm ride quality and limited rear passenger space.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add quarts of oil frequently.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels more frequently, performing oil consumption tests at the dealer to assess the severity, and potentially replacing piston rings or other engine components in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$5000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing turbocharger failures or malfunctions. Symptoms can include a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine bay, and error codes related to the turbocharger system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician to identify the specific cause of the issue, followed by repair or replacement of the faulty turbocharger components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Wet Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dual-clutch transmission can exhibit rough or jerky shifting, particularly at low speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. This can manifest as hesitation, lurching, or clunking sounds during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) to improve shift smoothness, or in some cases, replacement of the clutch packs or other transmission components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for software updates) / $2000 - $6000+ (for component replacements)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Stiff Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Kona N's suspension is tuned for performance, resulting in a firmer ride than the standard Kona. This can be uncomfortable for some drivers, especially on rough or uneven road surfaces.
    *   Solution: There is no easy solution. Consider aftermarket adjustable dampers for a softer ride, or a different vehicle with softer suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Consider purchasing the car with the ride stiffness in mind)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) / $500 - $2000+ (for head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Warning Lights (False Positives)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous warning lights appearing on the dashboard, even when no actual problem exists with the associated system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis using an OBD-II scanner to check for error codes, clearing any false codes, or addressing any underlying issues that may be triggering the warning lights.
