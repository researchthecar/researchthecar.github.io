The 2003 Hyundai Tiburon (also known as the Hyundai Coupe in some markets, and designated as the HMD 230 internally by Hyundai) is a sporty coupe offering decent handling and a stylish exterior for its time. Engine options typically included a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine (G4GC) producing around 138 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L V6 engine (G6BA) producing around 181 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual (V6 only), or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Tiburon's sporty styling and affordability but often cite concerns about build quality, interior materials, and long-term reliability.

**Summary**

The 2003 Hyundai Tiburon can be a stylish and affordable choice for a sporty coupe. However, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to the engine (timing belt, valve cover gaskets), transmission (especially with the automatic), and suspension (strut mounts, bushings). Electrical problems like window motors and alternators are also frequently reported. The cost of repairs can range from relatively minor for sensor replacements and fluid flushes to significant for engine or transmission overhauls. Rust is also a major concern, especially in areas with harsh winter conditions. Addressing these potential issues proactively through thorough inspections and regular maintenance can help extend the lifespan of the vehicle.
