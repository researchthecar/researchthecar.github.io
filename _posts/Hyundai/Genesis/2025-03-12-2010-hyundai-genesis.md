The 2010 Hyundai Genesis was a significant step for Hyundai, marking their entry into the luxury sedan market. This model came with a few engine options: a 3.8L V6 (290 hp, 264 lb-ft of torque), a 4.6L V8 (375 hp, 333 lb-ft of torque), and later in the model year, a 5.0L V8 (429 hp, 376 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Genesis for its luxurious features at a competitive price point, its comfortable ride, and its powerful engine options. Common complaints included some issues with the navigation system, electrical glitches, and occasional reports of suspension problems.
