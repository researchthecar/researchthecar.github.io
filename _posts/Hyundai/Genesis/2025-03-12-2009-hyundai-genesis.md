The 2009 Hyundai Genesis was a significant step for the Korean automaker, aiming to compete in the luxury sedan market. It was available with two engine options: a 3.8L V6 producing 290 hp and 264 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 4.6L V8 generating 375 hp and 333 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a ZF 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Genesis for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and impressive value for its price point. Common complaints centered around some early build quality issues, electrical glitches, and a less-than-stellar fuel economy, particularly with the V8.
