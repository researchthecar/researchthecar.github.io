The 2015 Hyundai Genesis is a luxury sedan praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong value proposition. It came standard with a 3.8-liter V6 engine producing 311 horsepower and 293 lb-ft of torque. There was also an optional 5.0-liter V8 engine, generating 420 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Genesis's quiet cabin, upscale features, and smooth driving experience. Some common complaints include a somewhat bland exterior styling and the lack of a true sport sedan driving feel compared to some European rivals.
