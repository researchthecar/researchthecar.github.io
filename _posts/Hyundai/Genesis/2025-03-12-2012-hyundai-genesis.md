The 2012 Hyundai Genesis is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong value proposition. It was available with three engine options: a 3.8L V6 producing 333 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque, a 4.6L V8 producing 385 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L V8 producing 429 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Genesis for its features, smooth ride, and powerful engine options. Common complaints often revolve around electrical gremlins, some build quality issues, and higher than expected maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**

*   **Engine Knocking/Ticking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking or ticking noise coming from the engine, especially when cold. This can be caused by worn piston rings, connecting rod bearings, or valve lifters.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a mechanic is crucial. The fix could range from an engine flush to replacing the affected parts (piston rings, bearings, or lifters) or even a complete engine rebuild in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.6L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent topping off between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Check for leaks, evaluate PCV valve function, and consider compression tests to assess the condition of piston rings. Possible solutions may include replacing the PCV valve, repairing oil leaks, or an engine rebuild if piston rings are the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $4000+ depending on the cause and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8**

*   **Valve Train Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise, primarily noticeable at idle and low speeds. This can be attributed to worn valve lifters or chain tensioners.
    *   Solution: Inspection of valve train components, replacement of worn lifters, chain tensioners, or timing chain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifting between gears, hesitation when accelerating, or transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, the valve body may need to be inspected and potentially rebuilt or replaced. In some cases, the torque converter may be the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3500+ (valve body replacement or transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the car sagging or sitting low, air compressor running constantly, "Suspension Fault" warning light.
    *   Solution: Diagnose leaks in the air springs, lines, or compressor. Replace the faulty components (air springs, compressor, or lines).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per side depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car battery draining overnight or within a few days of being parked, requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic draw by testing the current draw on different circuits. Common causes include a faulty door actuator, a malfunctioning amplifier, or a failing infotainment system module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system freezing, crashing, or displaying incorrect information. The infotainment system may also experience glitches, audio problems, or screen malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the system. If the problem persists, software updates may be available. In some cases, the unit needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/update) - $1500+ (replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings.
    *   Solution: Remove headlight assembly, inspect for cracks or loose seals. Dry out headlight and re-seal, or replace the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reseal) - $800+ (replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof not opening or closing properly, making grinding noises, or leaking.
    *   Solution: Inspect the sunroof tracks for debris or damage. Lubricate the tracks and check the motor. Damaged parts may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (lubrication) - $800+ (motor or track replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Hyundai Genesis, while a luxurious and comfortable vehicle, is not without its share of potential issues. Engine problems like knocking noises, oil consumption, and valve train noise can be costly to address. Transmission issues can also be a significant expense. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment problems, are also common. Air suspension failures, if equipped, can add to the maintenance costs. The severity of these issues varies, but some repairs can be quite expensive, making it important to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
