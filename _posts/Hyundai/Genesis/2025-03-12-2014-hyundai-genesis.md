The 2014 Hyundai Genesis marked a significant step forward for Hyundai into the luxury sedan market. It was offered with two engine choices: a 3.8L V6 producing 311 horsepower and 293 lb-ft of torque and a 5.0L V8 that delivers 420 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Genesis for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and long list of standard features. Criticisms often include a somewhat bland exterior design, limited brand recognition compared to established luxury brands, and a lack of the ultimate sporty handling found in some competitors.
