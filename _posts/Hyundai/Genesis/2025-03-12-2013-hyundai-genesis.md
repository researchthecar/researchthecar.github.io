The 2013 Hyundai Genesis is a luxury sedan known for its value and features. It offered a smooth ride, spacious interior, and a good amount of standard equipment for its price point. However, some owners have reported issues with reliability and certain components. Engine options included a 3.8L V6 producing 333 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque, a 4.6L V8 generating 385 horsepower and 333 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L V8 producing 429 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. What owners typically liked about the car were the abundant features, upscale styling, and comfortable ride. Dislikes often centered around the somewhat uninspired handling and occasional electronic glitches.

The most concerning problems revolve around the 5.0L V8's oil consumption and the timing chain issues in the 3.8L V6, as these can lead to expensive repairs. The transmission and electrical issues are also relatively common.
