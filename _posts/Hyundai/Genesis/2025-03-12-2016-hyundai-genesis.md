**Summary**

The 2016 Hyundai Genesis, while generally a reliable luxury sedan, does have some potential issues that buyers should be aware of. Engine oil leaks are the most prominent engine-related problem, especially with the 3.8L V6 and 5.0L V8. The 8-speed automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting, and the air suspension (if equipped) is a known weak point. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are also reported. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some being relatively minor fixes (e.g., software updates) and others requiring more extensive and costly repairs (e.g., engine replacement or transmission rebuild). Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
