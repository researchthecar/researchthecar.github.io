It was only offered with a 3.8L Lambda II V6 engine producing around 250 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Entourage's roomy interior, comfortable seating, and value for money. Common dislikes included less-than-stellar fuel economy and some reported reliability issues.

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are reported, often from the valve cover gaskets or oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil spots under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ depending on the location and extent of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **P0016 Crankshaft Position-Camshaft Position Correlation (Bank 1 Sensor A)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Diagnostic trouble code P0016 indicates a timing misalignment between the crankshaft and camshaft positions. Symptoms include rough idling, stalling, reduced power, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis needed to find the root cause, but could be related to oil sludge/blockage in the system, camshaft actuator failure, or timing chain wear/stretch. Replacement of the timing chain/tensioners, camshaft actuator(s), or cleaning of the oil passages might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or when downshifting. Could worsen over time.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, it may require further diagnostics and potentially valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush and filter change; $500 - $1200+ for valve body replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips while driving, resulting in poor acceleration and erratic RPM readings.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may temporarily help, but a slipping transmission often indicates internal damage. A rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4500+ for transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the rear suspension, bouncy ride, and reduced handling stability.

**Summary**

The 2010 Hyundai Entourage can be a good value for a used minivan, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine oil leaks and transmission problems, particularly harsh shifting or slipping, can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension and electrical issues, such as shock absorber failures and sliding door malfunctions, can also add to the overall cost of ownership. While some repairs may be relatively inexpensive, major issues like transmission rebuilds can be costly. It is important to have a pre-purchase inspection done by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems before buying.
