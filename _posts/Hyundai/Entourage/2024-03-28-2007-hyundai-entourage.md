**Introduction:**

The 2007 Hyundai Entourage is a versatile minivan introduced with two powertrain options including a 3.8L V6 engine paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission and a 3.3L V6 engine with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The 3.8L V6 produces 242 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, making it the more powerful option. While the Entourage generally receives positive feedback for its spacious cabin, comfortable seating, and affordable value, it has encountered various issues over the years.

**Engine**

* **3.8L V6**
  * **Cylinder Head Gasket Failure:** Blown head gaskets lead to coolant leaks, overheating, and engine damage. The solution involves replacing the faulty gasket and any damaged components. Estimated Cost: $1,500 - $2,500+
  * **Vacuum Leak:** Cracked vacuum hoses cause engine performance issues such as rough idling, misfiring, and poor fuel economy. Replacing the vacuum hoses restores proper engine operation. Estimated Cost: $100 - $300
* **3.3L V6**

**Transmission**

* **4-Speed Automatic**
  * **Shifting Issues:** Transmission slips, hesitates, or fails to engage gears due to faulty solenoids or other internal components. Transmission repair or replacement may be necessary. Estimated Cost: $1,200 - $3,000+
* **5-Speed Automatic**
  * **Transmission Fluid Leak:** A faulty transmission oil pan gasket or cracked seal can lead to fluid leakage, which affects transmission performance. Replacing the gasket or seal solves the issue. Estimated Cost: $300 - $600

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Failure:** Worn or damaged front struts result in a bumpy ride, decreased stability, and uneven tire wear. Strut replacement is typically required. Estimated Cost: $500 - $800
* **Rear Shock Absorber Leakage:** Leaking rear shock absorbers affect the stability and handling of the vehicle. Replacing the shock absorbers resolves the problem. Estimated Cost: $400 - $600

**Electrical**

* **Electrical Control Module (ECM) Failure:** A faulty ECM can cause various electrical issues such as starting problems, erratic engine performance, and component failure. Replacing the ECM is usually the solution. Estimated Cost: $800 - $1,200
* **Power Window Failure:** Malfunctioning power window switches or motors prevent windows from operating properly. Repairing the switches or motors restores window functionality. Estimated Cost: $200 - $400

**Exterior**

* **Tail Light Assembly Failure:** Water leakage into the tail light assembly can cause corrosion and electrical issues affecting tail lights and turn signals. Replacing the assembly solves the problem. Estimated Cost: $250 - $400

**Interior**

* **Airbag Control Module Failure:** A faulty airbag control module can prevent airbags from deploying in a collision. Replacing the control module is crucial for safety. Estimated Cost: $600 - $900
* **Dashboard Crack:** Exposure to heat and sunlight can cause the dashboard to crack or warp. Replacement of the dashboard is the only solution. Estimated Cost: $400 - $600

**Summary:**

The 2007 Hyundai Entourage can experience some issues affecting its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical systems, and interior components. The severity of these issues varies, but some can be costly to repair, such as cylinder head gasket failure or transmission problems. Overall, the issue frequency and repair costs are comparable to other vehicles in the same class. Regular maintenance and timely repairs are essential to mitigate potential issues and ensure the vehicle's reliability and safety.
