### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe XL generally offers good reliability, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of specific issues. The engines, particularly the 2.4L GDI, have seen reports of oil consumption and knocking noises, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues like hesitation and harsh shifting are also noted. On the electrical front, infotainment system glitches and battery drain are concerns. Exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling and interior problems such as HVAC blower motor failure and sunroof leaks have also been reported. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, they represent the most common technical complaints for this model year. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate some of these potential reliability concerns.
