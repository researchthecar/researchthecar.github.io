The 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe XL is a mid-size SUV that offers comfortable seating for up to seven passengers and a decent amount of cargo space. While praised for its spacious interior, user-friendly infotainment system, and overall value, some owners have reported encountering specific issues. The Santa Fe XL offered two engine options: a 3.3L V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine which did not end up being available for the XL Model. Both engine options were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some common dislikes include the fuel economy and reported issues related to the engine and transmission.

**Engine**

**3.3L V6**

*   **Engine Stalling or Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly while driving or exhibit hesitation during acceleration. This can occur at various speeds and under different driving conditions.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the root cause of the stalling. Possible causes include a faulty mass airflow sensor, a malfunctioning crankshaft position sensor, a failing fuel pump, or issues with the engine control unit (ECU). Replacement of the faulty component is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the part and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may occur from various locations, such as the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or front crankshaft seal. These leaks can lead to reduced oil levels and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the oil leak and replace the affected gasket or seal. In some cases, resealing the oil pan or timing cover may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+, depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, especially between certain gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change to see if that resolves the issue. If not, inspection of the valve body and solenoids might be needed. In some cases, replacement of the transmission is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping is a condition where the engine RPM increases without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This can occur during acceleration or when attempting to maintain a constant speed.
    *   Solution: Inspect the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. If not, a more thorough inspection of the transmission's internal components, such as the torque converter or clutches, may be necessary. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension components such as ball joints, control arm bushings, and struts. This can lead to noises, vibrations, and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components. A wheel alignment should be performed after the replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner, depending on the parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the battery drain. This may involve testing the charging system, checking for parasitic draws, and inspecting the battery's condition. Replacement of the battery or repair of the charging system may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the cause and solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other system functions.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the infotainment system. If the problem persists, a software update may be required. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment system may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (system replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or it may exhibit erratic behavior.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts, sensors, and motor. Replacement of the faulty component may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to turn on or may not heat properly.
    *   Solution: Check the seat heater elements and wiring. Replacement of the faulty component may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe XL, while generally a comfortable and spacious SUV, has some recurring issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine stalling, oil leaks, transmission problems, premature suspension wear, and electrical glitches are some of the common complaints. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with transmission replacements potentially being the most expensive. Proper maintenance and addressing issues promptly can help mitigate these problems.
