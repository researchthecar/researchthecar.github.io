The 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe XL is a three-row SUV that offered a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and a good amount of standard features for its time. However, it has been known to have some issues with the engine and other components. The Santa Fe XL came exclusively with a 3.3L Lambda II V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Santa Fe XL's smooth ride and ample cargo space, but some have reported issues with reliability and certain features.

**Engine**

**3.3L Lambda II V6**

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly, especially at low speeds or when idling. Some owners have reported hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: This issue is often attributed to faulty fuel injectors, a dirty throttle body, or a failing crankshaft position sensor. Start by cleaning the throttle body. If the issue persists, test the fuel injectors and replace any that are not performing correctly. The crankshaft position sensor can also be tested and replaced if faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (Throttle Body Cleaning), $200 - $800+ (Fuel Injector Replacement), $100 - $300+ (Crankshaft Position Sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may develop from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets or the oil pan gasket. Visible oil spots under the vehicle and a burning oil smell are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket. Valve cover gaskets are a common source.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (Valve Cover Gasket), $200 - $600+ (Oil Pan Gasket)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knocking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking noise may come from the engine, particularly during cold starts or under heavy load. This can sometimes indicate issues with the connecting rod bearings or piston slap.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a heavier-weight oil might help. However, if the noise persists or worsens, further diagnosis is needed. This could indicate failing connecting rod bearings, requiring engine disassembly or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Oil Change to Heavier Weight Oil). $2,000-$6,000+ (Engine Repair or Replacement)

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears.

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement of the transmission, especially when shifting from park to drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush may help. If the problem persists, the torque converter or the transmission itself may be failing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (Fluid Flush), $800 - $2000+ (Torque Converter), $2500 - $5000+ (Transmission Replacement)
