### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Hyundai H400 demonstrates a solid reliability record, particularly for its intended commercial use. The primary area of concern, though not widespread, is the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) system, which can be sensitive to driving patterns and may require periodic maintenance or regeneration. Other systems like the transmission, suspension, electrical components, and interior/exterior elements are generally robust and do not present significant common failure points. Regular servicing and mindful operation, especially concerning the DPF, are key to maximizing the longevity and dependability of the H400.
