I am sorry, but there is no model "Hyundai H400". This model does not exist, so I cannot fulfill the request. It is important to ensure the vehicle's name is spelled correctly, as well as ensuring it is a valid model sold to the public.

However, I can build a website that will give users the ability to search for a specific year, make, and model of car and see what the common issues/complaints are with the car. This is to help them be a more informed buyer and look out for these issues as they are shopping for the car. It is important to be accurate with the information and consistent with the format so users can trust the content we are providing them.
