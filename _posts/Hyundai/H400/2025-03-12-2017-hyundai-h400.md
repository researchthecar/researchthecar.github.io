The 2017 Hyundai H1, also known in some markets as the Hyundai Starex, is a van appreciated for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and practicality. Engine options for the 2017 model typically include a 2.5L CRDi diesel engine, producing around 136-170 horsepower and 343-441 Nm of torque, depending on the specific tune and market. Transmission options commonly include a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the H1 for its large passenger capacity and cargo space, making it suitable for families or commercial use. Some common criticisms include the van's relatively simple interior design and fuel economy compared to more modern vehicles.

**Engine**

**2.5L CRDi Diesel**

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clogging or failure of the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can lead to rough idling, poor acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive soot buildup in the DPF can cause reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and DPF regeneration failure.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration or replacement of the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for regeneration; $800 - $2000+ for replacement.

**Summary**

The 2017 Hyundai H1 can suffer from several issues. The most serious are related to the EGR valve and Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) in the diesel engine configurations, which can lead to significant performance problems. Transmission issues, especially rough shifting, also represent a concern. Other issues like suspension sagging, electrical system malfunctions, sliding door problems, and air conditioning faults can lead to inconvenience and repair costs. While none of these are universally reported, pre-purchase inspections focusing on these areas are highly recommended. The cost of repairs can vary significantly, with engine and transmission work potentially being the most expensive.
