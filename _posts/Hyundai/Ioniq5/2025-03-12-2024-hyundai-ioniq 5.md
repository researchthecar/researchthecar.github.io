Here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5, categorized by major components. Keep in mind that this is based on currently available data and may change as more information becomes available. The 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 is an all-electric compact SUV that has garnered praise for its retro-futuristic design, spacious interior, fast charging capabilities, and comfortable ride. It is available with a single motor rear-wheel drive configuration (168 hp, 258 lb-ft of torque in base SE trim) or a dual-motor all-wheel drive configuration (320 hp, 446 lb-ft of torque). The Ioniq 5 utilizes a single-speed reduction gear transmission. Some common complaints include the infotainment system being slow, issues with the heat pump in cold weather affecting range, and limited cargo space compared to some competitors.

**Electric Motor**

**Single Motor Rear-Wheel Drive**

*   **Reduced Power in Cold Weather**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report a significant decrease in acceleration and overall power output in cold ambient temperatures (below freezing). This is especially noticeable when trying to accelerate quickly from a stop or merge onto a highway. The issue seems to be related to the battery management system limiting power to protect the battery in cold conditions.
    *   Solution: There is no permanent fix. The vehicle's performance should return to normal as temperatures rise. Hyundai may release a software update to improve cold weather performance in the future. Preconditioning the battery prior to driving in cold weather can improve performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (No cost, performance will return to normal)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive**

*   **Reduced Power in Cold Weather**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the RWD model, owners of the AWD Ioniq 5 report reduced power and acceleration in cold weather. The impact seems less severe than in the RWD model, but still noticeable.
    *   Solution: There is no permanent fix. The vehicle's performance should return to normal as temperatures rise. Hyundai may release a software update to improve cold weather performance in the future. Preconditioning the battery prior to driving in cold weather can improve performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (No cost, performance will return to normal)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery System**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery can drain prematurely, leading to the car failing to start or displaying error messages. This issue is exacerbated by frequent short trips or leaving the vehicle unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Hyundai recommends regular charging of the 12V battery, especially in cold weather or when the vehicle is not used frequently. Some owners have installed a 12V battery maintainer. If the battery is repeatedly failing, replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for 12V battery replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Single Speed Reduction Gear Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Harsh Ride Quality on Rough Roads**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners find the ride quality to be harsh, especially on roads with potholes or uneven surfaces. This is primarily attributed to the suspension tuning, which prioritizes handling over comfort.
    *   Solution: There is no official fix for this. Some owners have replaced the factory tires with tires that have a softer sidewall, or have installed aftermarket shocks/struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (depending on aftermarket suspension parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can be slow to respond, freeze intermittently, or experience glitches. This issue is more common in early production models.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Hyundai have addressed some of these issues. Ensure the vehicle is running the latest software version. A system reset (consult the owner's manual) may temporarily resolve the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (Software update, usually free at the dealership)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Heat Pump Issues in Cold Weather**
    * Description/Symptoms: The heat pump, which is used for heating the cabin, can be inefficient or fail to operate in very cold temperatures, leading to reduced range.
    * Solution: Preconditioning the cabin while plugged in, and using seat heaters to reduce the need for heat. Some Owners have seen the issue disappear after a software update.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (Software update, usually free at the dealership), $500-$1500+ (Heat Pump Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Charging Port Door Freeze**
    * Description/Symptoms: In cold weather, the charging port door can freeze shut, preventing access to the charging port.
    * Solution: Carefully use a de-icer or a hairdryer to melt the ice. Avoid using excessive force to open the door.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Pixelated Tail Light Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Malfunction of individual lights in the Pixelated tail lights.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty tail light assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000 (tail light assembly replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Creaking Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported creaking or rattling noises coming from the dashboard or other interior trim pieces, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: This issue often requires a technician to identify the source of the noise and apply felt tape or other padding to eliminate the friction causing the creaking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the severity and location of the noise)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 is generally considered a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported a few common issues. The most prevalent problems seem to be related to the infotainment system, cold weather performance, and suspension harshness. While some of these issues can be resolved with software updates or minor repairs, others, like the ride quality, are inherent to the vehicle's design. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but overall, they do not appear to be widespread enough to significantly detract from the Ioniq 5's appeal.
