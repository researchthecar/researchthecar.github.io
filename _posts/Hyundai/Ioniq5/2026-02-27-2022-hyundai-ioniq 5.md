# 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5

### Overview
The 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5, a groundbreaking all-electric crossover, has generally received high marks for its innovative design, spacious interior, and impressive performance. As an early model year for a completely new platform, initial reliability data is still accumulating. However, based on early owner feedback and expert reviews, the Ioniq 5 demonstrates a strong start in terms of dependability. The electric powertrain, with fewer moving parts than traditional internal combustion engines, inherently reduces the potential for certain types of mechanical failures. Focus areas for electric vehicles often shift towards battery health, charging systems, and software integration, where the Ioniq 5 has shown promising, though not entirely flawless, early performance.
