*   **Reduced Range in Cold Weather**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners report a significant decrease in driving range during cold weather conditions. The reduction can be more substantial than expected compared to gasoline-powered vehicles.
    *   Solution: No direct fix. Drivers can mitigate the issue by preconditioning the battery before driving, using seat heaters instead of cabin heat when possible, and adjusting driving habits for efficiency.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slow Charging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported slow charging speeds at 350kW charging stations. This is an issue with the vehicle and not the charging station.
    *   Solution: Software update to resolve the issues with the BMS.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical System**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery can drain unexpectedly, especially when the vehicle is not driven for several days, leaving the car unable to start. This is an auxiliary battery and not the main drive battery.
    *   Solution: Dealers have been instructed to inspect the vehicle and update the Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU) software to prevent excessive 12V battery drain. In some cases, the 12V battery itself may need replacement. Some owners have purchased a trickle charger to maintain the 12V battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update), $100-$300+ (12V Battery Replacement - if not covered under warranty).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ICCU (Integrated Charging Control Unit) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ICCU is responsible for both AC and DC charging of the main battery and charging of the 12V auxiliary battery. A faulty ICCU can prevent the vehicle from charging at all, display charging errors, or intermittently fail to charge.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the ICCU. In some cases, software updates may address the problem if caught early.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2000+ (ICCU Replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, and rebooting issues are reported with the infotainment system. Some owners also report issues with the navigation system and wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity.
    *   Solution: Software updates are frequently released to address these issues. A hard reset of the system may also provide temporary relief. In extreme cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update), $800-$1500+ (Infotainment Unit Replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **False Safety System Alerts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Random activation of driver-assistance features such as forward collision warning, lane keep assist, or blind-spot monitoring.
    *   Solution: Dealership inspection and recalibration of the sensors or replacement of faulty sensors. Software updates may also address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $500+ (Sensor Replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Charging Port Door Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the charging port door, sometimes due to freezing in cold weather or mechanical failure of the latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Applying lubricant to the latch mechanism, thawing ice, or replacing the door latch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (Latch Replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Head-Up Display (HUD) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: HUD may be blurry, distorted, or not displaying information correctly. In some cases, it may fail to function entirely.

**Summary**

The 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5, while praised for its styling and technology, has experienced a range of issues. The most concerning are the potential ICCU failure (which can be costly) and the 12V battery drain, as these can leave owners stranded. The other issues, such as infotainment glitches, rattling noises, and false safety alerts, are generally less severe but can be annoying. Addressing these issues can range from software updates (free) to potentially costly component replacements (over $1500). Prospective buyers should be aware of these common complaints and check whether the vehicle has had the necessary software updates or component replacements performed.
