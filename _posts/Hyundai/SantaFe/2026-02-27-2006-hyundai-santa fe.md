### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe is a generally dependable SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine oil leaks and timing belt concerns are notable for the V6 engines, requiring diligent maintenance. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting, can arise and may necessitate costly repairs. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, can cause frustration. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor may need replacement. Overall, with proper inspection and maintenance, the Santa Fe can still be a reasonable choice, but budgeting for potential repairs is advisable.
