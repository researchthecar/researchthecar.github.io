### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe generally presents as a reasonably reliable vehicle, especially considering its age and market position. The most commonly cited issues tend to revolve around the engine, particularly head gasket concerns on the 2.4L and timing belt maintenance on the 2.7L V6. Transmission issues, while not universal, can manifest as harsh shifting. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also areas to inspect for wear. Electrical problems, such as alternator failure and window regulators, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern, especially in corrosive climates. Overall, proactive maintenance, particularly for the timing belt and fluid changes, can significantly mitigate potential problems. Addressing minor issues promptly can help maintain the Santa Fe's overall dependability.
