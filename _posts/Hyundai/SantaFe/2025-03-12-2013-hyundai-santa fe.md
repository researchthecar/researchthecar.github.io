The 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe is a popular SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and value for money. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 190 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 264 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the vehicle's design and features, some common complaints revolve around engine issues, particularly with the 2.4L engine, and some electrical glitches. Others have expressed concerns regarding the responsiveness of the transmission and ride quality.
