The 2020 Hyundai Santa Fe is a popular mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 generating 235 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Santa Fe's value, abundant safety features, and smooth handling. However, some criticisms include the base engine's lackluster acceleration and occasionally reported electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Engine Stalling/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported sudden engine stalling while driving, sometimes without warning. This can lead to loss of power steering and braking. In some cases, the engine may fail completely.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is necessary. The issue could be related to fuel delivery, ignition, or other engine components. Replacement of faulty parts, such as the fuel pump or crankshaft position sensor, may be required. In more severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed their Santa Fe consuming an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored and addressed.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed. A dealer can perform an oil consumption test to determine the severity. Depending on the results, possible solutions include replacing piston rings, valve stem seals, or the entire engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **Engine Knocking/Piston Damage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of engine knocking noises, especially under acceleration. This can be indicative of pre-ignition or detonation, potentially leading to piston damage.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is necessary. The issue could be related to carbon buildup, faulty fuel injectors, or incorrect spark plugs. Repair may involve cleaning or replacing components, or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**

**Summary**

The 2020 Hyundai Santa Fe, while generally reliable, has been subject to several issues. Engine problems, particularly stalling, excessive oil consumption, and knocking, can be severe and expensive to repair, potentially costing thousands of dollars. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, can also be costly to address. Electrical problems such as battery drain and infotainment glitches are less severe but still inconvenient. Owners should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle inspected regularly.
