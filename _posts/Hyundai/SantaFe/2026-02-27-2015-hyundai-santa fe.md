### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe presents a generally solid reliability record. The most frequently cited technical concerns revolve around the gasoline engines, specifically oil consumption in both the 2.4L and 3.3L variants, and potential knocking/pinging in the 2.4L. Transmission issues, such as hesitation or shuddering, are also noted but appear less common. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are present but not pervasive. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread reported defects. Overall, the Santa Fe is a dependable choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the engine oil consumption and transmission shift quality as areas to inspect.
