The 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe is a mid-size SUV offering a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and a good value proposition. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.3L V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Santa Fe for its smooth ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and ample cargo space. However, some common complaints include issues with the engine, electrical system, and occasional build quality concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly while driving or idling, or hesitate during acceleration. This can be intermittent and may not always trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: The issue has been related to the High Pressure Fuel Pump(HPFP). Replacing the HPFP and updating the engine control unit (ECU) software can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: 22V-657: Hyundai is recalling certain 2017-2018 Sonata, 2016-2018 Sonata Hybrid, 2018-2020 Accent, and 2016-2017 Azera vehicles. The piston rings may not have been properly heat-treated, which can result in excessive oil consumption, and possible engine damage.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Drivers experience a need to add oil frequently between scheduled oil changes. There might be visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: A diagnosis from a qualified mechanic is needed to pinpoint the root cause. Possible repairs include piston ring replacement or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: 22V-657: Hyundai is recalling certain 2017-2018 Sonata, 2016-2018 Sonata Hybrid, 2018-2020 Accent, and 2016-2017 Azera vehicles. The piston rings may not have been properly heat-treated, which can result in excessive oil consumption, and possible engine damage.

**3.3L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit rough or jerky shifts between gears. Some owners report experiencing a "clunking" sound during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Often this can be resolved by replacing the transmission fluid. In other cases, a more in depth inspection of the transmission, valve body, and solenoids may be necessary to determine if replacement of parts is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip out of gear while driving or fail to engage properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to see what parts need to be replaced. Valve body and solenoids are common to be replaced, or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven road surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn sway bar links, bushings, or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for an extended period of time, leading to difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery can help but if the battery continues to drain, a parasitic draw test can be done to identify the source of the drain, which is commonly caused by faulty relays, modules, or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive, requiring a restart to restore functionality.
    *   Solution: Performing a software update can help to resolve this issue. If it does not, the system may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Parking Assist Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The parking assist system may display error messages or fail to function correctly.

**Summary**

The 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe has some notable issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly in the 2.4L inline-4 cylinder such as stalling, hesitation, and excessive oil consumption, can be a concern. Electrical issues and transmission problems also appear to be somewhat common. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs like engine or transmission replacement can be costly. Reviewing vehicle maintenance records and performing a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
