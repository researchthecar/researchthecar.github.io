The 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe is a popular compact SUV known for its affordability and practicality. It offered two engine choices: a 2.7L V6 producing 185 horsepower and 183 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.5L V6 generating 200 horsepower and 219 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciated the Santa Fe's comfortable ride and spacious interior, while common complaints often revolved around fuel economy and some reliability concerns, particularly with higher mileage examples.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt can fail prematurely, especially if maintenance is neglected. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, and, in severe cases, engine damage if the belt snaps.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt according to the manufacturer's recommended service interval (typically every 60,000 miles) along with the water pump, tensioner, and idler pulleys.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ depending on labor costs and whether related components are replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve cover gaskets, leading to oil consumption, burning smell, and potential oil spots under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft position sensor could fail, leading to a check engine light, rough idling, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    *   Solution: This can be a difficult issue to resolve, and the proper course of action would be a full engine inspection to diagnose the cause. Depending on the source, possible solutions include replacing valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Shift Flare**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced a "shift flare", which is a momentary rise in engine RPMs between gear changes, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change *might* help. A more permanent fix may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) to $2000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can manifest as shuddering or vibrations at highway speeds, poor acceleration, and difficulty maintaining speed uphill.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's often recommended to rebuild the transmission while doing this, since the transmission must be disassembled to access the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, particularly when carrying heavy loads, causing a lower ride height and potentially affecting handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear coil springs and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn or damaged strut mounts can cause clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts along with the struts for optimal performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700 per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows can stop working, often due to a failed motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor and/or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks may stop working, either intermittently or completely, due to a failed actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace the door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the undercarriage, around the wheel wells, and along the rocker panels, especially in areas with harsh winters or coastal climates.
    *   Solution: Rust repair varies depending on the extent of the damage. Options range from sanding and painting small areas to replacing entire body panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on severity and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking and splitting of the dashboard, especially in sun-exposed areas.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (cover) to $1000+ (replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may leak, get stuck, or fail to open/close properly.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the sunroof motor, tracks, or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe has some common issues. Engine issues range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing sensors to more costly timing belt replacements or addressing oil consumption. Transmission problems can range in cost from fluid changes to full rebuilds. Suspension issues are common due to the age of the vehicle and can affect ride quality and handling. Electrical issues, such as power window and door lock failures, are also fairly common. Interior and exterior issues, like dashboard cracking and rust, are typical for vehicles of this age, and rust is more prevalent in certain climates.
