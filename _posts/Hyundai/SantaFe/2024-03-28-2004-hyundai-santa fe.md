The 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe is a mid-size SUV that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The base engine was a 2.4-liter inline-four that produced 155 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine was a 3.5-liter V6 that produced 200 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Santa Fe was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordable price. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, poor fuel economy, and dated interior.
