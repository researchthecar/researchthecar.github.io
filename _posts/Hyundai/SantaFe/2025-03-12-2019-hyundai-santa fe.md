Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe, categorized by major component and engine/transmission configuration, adhering to the requested format.

The 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe is a mid-size SUV that offers a comfortable ride and a good amount of standard features. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine generating 235 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Santa Fe's spacious interior and user-friendly infotainment system. Some common dislikes include the base engine's perceived lack of power and occasionally reported issues with some of the electronic systems.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall or hesitate, particularly during acceleration or when idling. This can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: In some cases, software updates to the Engine Control Module (ECM) have resolved the issue. Other times, fuel system components (fuel pump, injectors) or sensors (crankshaft position sensor, mass airflow sensor) may need to be inspected and replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: This issue can be difficult to resolve definitively. It might involve replacing piston rings or even the entire engine in severe cases. Hyundai issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) related to oil consumption issues in some of their engines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking or pinging sound may be heard, especially under acceleration. This can indicate pre-ignition or detonation.
    *   Solution: Using higher octane fuel might temporarily alleviate the issue. However, a proper diagnosis should be performed to rule out issues with the fuel injectors, spark plugs, or the engine's timing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation, rough or jerky shifting, or slipping between gears are all potential issues.
    *   Solution: A software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may resolve the problem. If that doesn't work, the transmission may require internal repairs or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect and potentially replace the rear sway bar links, bushings, or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset might temporarily resolve the issue. Software updates may also be available to address the problem. If the issue persists, the infotainment unit might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain quickly, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Have the battery and charging system tested. A parasitic draw may be present, requiring further investigation to identify the source.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic tailgate may not open or close properly, or it may stop midway.

**Summary**

The 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe has some potential issues, with the engine and transmission being the most concerning areas. Engine issues, particularly oil consumption and potential stalling, can be costly to repair. Electrical glitches, while less severe, can still be frustrating. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. It's crucial for potential buyers to be aware of these common problems and to have a thorough pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
