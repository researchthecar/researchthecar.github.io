The 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe represents a significant redesign for the model, moving into its fifth generation. It offers a bold new exterior design and a more luxurious interior. The Santa Fe is available with two primary engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L Turbo Hybrid engine producing 178 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque when combined with the electric motor. Both engines are paired with automatic transmissions. People generally appreciate the redesigned interior, enhanced technology features, and increased cargo space. Some common dislikes include the divisive exterior styling and potential reliability concerns associated with new model years.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly is crucial. If consumption is excessive, a dealer visit is recommended for diagnosis, potentially including oil consumption testing. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (if piston ring replacement is required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the engine stalling unexpectedly while driving, leading to a loss of power and potential safety hazards.
    *   Solution: The issue may be related to the fuel delivery system or engine control unit (ECU). A diagnostic check at a dealership is recommended. Software updates or component replacements (fuel pump, injectors) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the component.
