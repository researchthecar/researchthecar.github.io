**Introduction:**

The 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe is a midsize SUV available in both 5- and 7-passenger configurations. It offers a choice of two engines: a 2.4-liter inline-four and a 3.3-liter V6. The 2.4-liter engine produces 175 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.3-liter V6 generates 290 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic and a 5-speed automatic with Shiftronic manual shifting.

Owners generally praise the Santa Fe for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly features. However, it has received some criticism for its lack of power from the base engine and its excessive fuel consumption.
