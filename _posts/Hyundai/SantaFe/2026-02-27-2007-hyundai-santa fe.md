## Engine

### 2.7L V6 Lambda G6EA
**Oil Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level.
- **Solution:** Replacement of leaking gaskets (e.g., valve cover, oil pan) or seals.
- **Cost:** $200 - $600

**Timing Chain Tensioner Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup or at idle.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the timing chain tensioner and potentially the chain and guides.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500


### 3.3L V6 Lambda G6DF
**Oil Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level.
- **Solution:** Replacement of leaking gaskets (e.g., valve cover, oil pan) or seals.
- **Cost:** $200 - $600

**Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Check Engine light, rough idle, decreased engine performance, rattling noise.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the faulty VVT actuator.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Automatic (H-Matic)
**Harsh Shifting / Slipping**
- **Symptoms:** Jerky gear changes, delayed engagement, slipping between gears.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or full transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2500+


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering feel, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**Premature Strut/Shock Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, reduced handling.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn struts or shocks.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Malfunctions**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows not working, interior lights flickering, door locks acting erratically.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000


### Alternator
**Early Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Dimming headlights, battery warning light, difficulty starting.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


## Exterior

### Standard Body
**Rear Hatch Struts**
- **Symptoms:** Rear hatch not staying open, difficulty lifting.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the rear hatch support struts.
- **Cost:** $100 - $250


## Interior

### Standard Cabin
**HVAC Blower Motor Resistor**
- **Symptoms:** Fan only works on highest setting, or not at all.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
- **Cost:** $100 - $200

### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe generally presents a reasonable reliability record for its age and segment. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the engine, particularly oil leaks and, in some cases, timing chain tensioner or VVT actuator problems, especially with the larger engines. Transmission issues, while not universal, can manifest as harsh shifting. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts may require attention as the vehicle ages. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or premature alternator failure, are also noted. Exterior and interior issues are less frequent, with rear hatch struts and HVAC resistors being the most common minor complaints. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early warning signs are crucial for maintaining the Santa Fe's reliability.
