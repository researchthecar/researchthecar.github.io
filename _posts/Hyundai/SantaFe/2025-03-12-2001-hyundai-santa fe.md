The 2001 Hyundai Santa Fe marked Hyundai's entry into the SUV market. It was generally praised for its affordability, practicality, and relatively spacious interior. However, it wasn't without its flaws, and owners have reported a range of issues over the years. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 149 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L V6 engine producing approximately 181 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual (depending on the engine and trim level). Some common dislikes included the sometimes-underpowered performance of the base engine and some concerns about long-term reliability.

**Summary**
The 2001 Hyundai Santa Fe, while affordable and practical, presents a range of potential issues related to the engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and body. Engine and transmission issues can range from manageable (oil leaks, harsh shifting) to severe (timing belt breakage, transmission failure), with costs varying accordingly. Suspension and electrical issues are more common and generally less expensive to address. Rust can be a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Overall, a pre-purchase inspection is crucial to identify and assess the severity of any existing problems.
