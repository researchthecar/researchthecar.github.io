If a small, hard object (for example, a coin or pen) has fallen between the seat back and seat cushion, it could damage the buckle release button. This will cause the buckle to not latch when the seat is returned to its normal position. Consequence: If the buckle cannot be engaged, the occupant will not be restrained during a crash, which could result in serious injury or death. Remedy: Dealers will inspect the front seat belt buckle and install a protector plate. Owner notification began November 10, 2003. Owners who take their vehicles to an authorized dealer on an agreed upon service date and leave it there continuously until the recall work has been completed shall be reimbursed for reasonable transportation expenses if alternate transportation is required.

**Summary**

The 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe can be a relatively affordable vehicle but has age-related reliability issues. Engine issues like timing belt failure are crucial to address and can be costly if neglected. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic, are also common. Suspension wear and electrical issues can add to the cost of ownership. Rust, especially in colder climates, should also be a major concern. The severity and cost of repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific issue and the vehicle's condition, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision and maintenance budget.
