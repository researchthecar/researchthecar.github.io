Alright, here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe, organized by category and engine/transmission options, based on available information.

The 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe is a mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and value for money. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, a turbocharged 2.5L inline-4 cylinder engine that produces 281 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid 1.6L inline-4 cylinder engine which produces 226 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate the Santa Fe's stylish design and generous standard features, while others find the base engine underpowered and the infotainment system somewhat complicated. Common gripes include issues with the DCT transmission and some electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Cylinder Engine (191 hp, 181 lb-ft)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil changes or top-offs between scheduled services. Symptoms may include low oil level warnings and visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: Hyundai recommends monitoring oil consumption and performing an oil consumption test. If excessive consumption is confirmed, repairs may involve replacing piston rings or other internal engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of the repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbocharged Inline-4 Cylinder Engine (281 hp, 311 lb-ft)**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the engine stalling unexpectedly while driving, particularly at lower speeds or after idling. This can pose a safety risk.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to identify the cause of the stalling are necessary. Potential causes include fuel system issues, sensor malfunctions, or software problems. Repairs may involve replacing faulty components or updating the engine control unit (ECU) software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (Matched with 2.5L Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted rough or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during gear changes has also been reported.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) software update may resolve some shifting issues. If the problem persists, mechanical inspection and potential repairs to the valve body or other transmission components may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) (Matched with 2.5L Turbo Engine)**

*   **DCT Jerkiness at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint with DCTs in general is jerkiness or hesitation at low speeds, especially in stop-and-go traffic. This is due to the nature of the dual-clutch design, which can be less smooth than a traditional automatic at very low speeds.
    *   Solution: While some DCT behavior is inherent to the design, software updates may improve shift quality. In some cases, clutch replacement may be necessary if the problem becomes severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, including the touchscreen display, may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Try restarting the infotainment system. A software update may address the issue. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,200+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the blind spot monitoring system. False alerts or failure to detect vehicles in the blind spot are common complaints.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the BSM system, checking sensor alignment, and replacing faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the sensor and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found
