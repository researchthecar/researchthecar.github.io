The 2017 Hyundai Elantra GT is a hatchback version of the popular Elantra sedan, offering more cargo space and a sporty driving experience. Two engine options were available: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 cylinder engine producing 162 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L turbo engine was available with a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praise the Elantra GT for its value, practicality, and comfortable ride. Criticisms often revolve around the less-than-stellar fuel economy compared to competitors and some reported issues with certain components.
