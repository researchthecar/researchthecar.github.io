Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2018 Hyundai Elantra GT, organized by category and powertrain configuration, following your specified format.

The 2018 Hyundai Elantra GT is a hatchback version of the popular Elantra sedan, offering more cargo space and sporty handling. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 161 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 (Elantra GT Sport) producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 1.6L turbo engine was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT).
