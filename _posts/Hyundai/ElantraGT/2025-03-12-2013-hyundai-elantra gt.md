The 2013 Hyundai Elantra GT is a hatchback version of the popular Elantra sedan, offering increased cargo space and a sportier driving experience. The Elantra GT came equipped with a 1.8-liter inline-4 cylinder engine, producing approximately 148 horsepower and 131 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciated the Elantra GT's fuel efficiency, agile handling, and generous standard features for its price point. Common complaints often revolved around the sometimes harsh ride quality, road noise, and the relatively uninspiring acceleration despite the decent horsepower numbers.
