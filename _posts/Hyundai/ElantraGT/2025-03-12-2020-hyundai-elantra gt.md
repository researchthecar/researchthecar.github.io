The 2020 Hyundai Elantra GT is a hatchback version of the Elantra sedan, offering increased cargo space and sporty handling. It came with two engine options: a 2.0L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 161 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L turbo came with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners appreciate the Elantra GT's practicality, fun-to-drive nature (especially the N-Line with the turbo engine), and generous features for the price. Common dislikes include the DCT's low-speed behavior, some cheap interior materials, and the lack of certain advanced safety features on lower trims.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a knocking or pinging noise coming from the engine, especially under load or during acceleration. This can be more noticeable with lower octane fuel.
    *   Solution: Try using a higher octane fuel (89 or higher) as recommended in the owner's manual. If the problem persists, the dealer may need to inspect the engine for potential issues such as carbon buildup or faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (fuel change) - $100+ (diagnosis and potential repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If excessive consumption is confirmed, a dealer inspection may be needed. Potential fixes could range from replacing valve stem seals to more extensive engine work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100+ (diagnosis and potential repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.0L Engine)**

*   No Issues Found

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) (Paired with 1.6L Turbo Engine)**

*   **Jerky Shifting at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint with the 7-speed DCT is jerky or hesitant shifting, particularly at low speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. This can manifest as lurching or delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: A software update or TCU (Transmission Control Unit) reflash may improve the shifting behavior. In some cases, replacing the DCT clutch pack may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (clutch pack replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or knocking noise coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps or uneven surfaces. This is sometimes attributed to the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rear shock absorbers and their mounting hardware for damage or wear. Replacing the shock absorbers may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (shock absorber replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates for the infotainment system. A dealer may be able to diagnose and repair any hardware or software issues causing the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $100+ (diagnosis and potential repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. Replacement of the camera unit might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (camera replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling or squeaking noises coming from the dashboard, door panels, or rear hatch area.
    *   Solution: Locate the source of the noise and attempt to dampen or secure the affected components. Dealership service departments can also attempt to address these issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY fix) - $100+ (dealer diagnosis and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Hyundai Elantra GT has a few common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns relate to the 7-speed DCT's low-speed behavior, the potential for engine knocking on the 2.0L engine, and excessive oil consumption on the 1.6L turbo engine. Suspension noises and infotainment glitches are also occasionally reported. While many of these issues are relatively minor and can be addressed with software updates or minor repairs, clutch pack replacements in the DCT can be costly. The severity of these issues varies, and it's important to thoroughly inspect any used Elantra GT and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic to identify any potential problems.
