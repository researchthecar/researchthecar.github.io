The 2014 Hyundai Elantra GT is a compact hatchback that offered a practical and stylish alternative to the sedan version. It came equipped with a 2.0-liter inline-4 G4ND engine producing 173 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. It was offered with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Elantra GT's sporty handling, spacious cargo area, and feature-rich interior. Common complaints include a somewhat stiff ride, average fuel economy for the class, and some reported electrical issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L G4ND Inline-4**

*   **Engine Knocking/Ticking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported hearing a knocking or ticking sound coming from the engine, especially at idle or low speeds. This can be an early indication of rod knock or other internal engine damage.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the knocking sound is crucial. If rod knock is confirmed, a full engine rebuild or replacement is often necessary. In some cases, a faulty oil control valve or issues with the hydraulic lash adjusters can cause ticking noises that can be resolved with replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (engine replacement). $200 - $800+ (oil control valve or lash adjuster repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced the engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can help identify the source of oil consumption. Potential causes include worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or cylinder wall damage. Depending on the cause, the solution may involve replacing the affected components or performing an engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, especially between certain gears. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement can sometimes resolve minor harsh shifting issues. If the problem persists, it may indicate issues with the valve body or solenoids inside the transmission. In such cases, replacing or rebuilding the transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush). $500 - $3,000+ (valve body/transmission repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the transmission slipping, meaning the engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed. This can be caused by worn clutch packs or other internal transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Similar to harsh shifting, a fluid flush may provide a temporary improvement, but transmission slipping typically indicates a more serious problem. A transmission rebuild or replacement is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to lock or unlock properly, or intermittently functioning. This issue is often attributed to faulty door lock actuators.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Instrument Cluster**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster (speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, etc.) stops working or displays incorrect information.
    *   Solution: The instrument cluster needs to be replaced or repaired by a specialized shop.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the sunroof, often during heavy rain. This can lead to water damage inside the cabin.
    *   Solution: Clearing the sunroof drain tubes or replacing the sunroof seal. In severe cases, the entire sunroof assembly may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag warning light illuminating on the dashboard, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the airbag system to identify the cause of the warning light. Possible causes include faulty airbag sensors, wiring issues, or a malfunctioning airbag control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Hyundai Elantra GT is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some common issues. The most concerning problems relate to the engine, specifically knocking and excessive oil consumption, which can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting and slipping, are also relatively common. Electrical problems, such as faulty door lock actuators, and some exterior/interior issues such as sunroof leaks and airbag lights also appear. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the severity of the issue. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
