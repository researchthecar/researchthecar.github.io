The 2016 Hyundai Elantra GT is a hatchback version of the popular Elantra sedan. It offered a blend of practicality, fuel efficiency, and features. Engine options included a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Elantra GT for its cargo space, sporty handling, and value for money. Common dislikes included the somewhat firm ride, some cheap interior plastics, and occasionally lackluster fuel economy compared to EPA estimates.
