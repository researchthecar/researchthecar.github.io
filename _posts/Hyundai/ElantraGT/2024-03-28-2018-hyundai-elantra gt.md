The 2018 Hyundai Elantra GT is a compact hatchback that offers sporty handling and a comfortable interior. It is available with two engine options: a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that produces 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder that produces 161 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque.
