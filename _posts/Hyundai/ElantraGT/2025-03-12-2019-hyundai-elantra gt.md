The 2019 Hyundai Elantra GT is a sporty hatchback praised for its practicality, good handling, and standard features. It came with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 161 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 generating 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L turbo was offered with a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners generally appreciate the Elantra GT's cargo space, fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.0L), and comfortable ride. Some common complaints include the DCT's behavior at low speeds (jerky shifting), the infotainment system's lag, and the interior's relatively basic design compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**1.6L Turbo Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Blue exhaust smoke might be present.
    *   Solution: In some cases, dealers perform an oil consumption test to determine the severity. If excessive consumption is confirmed, possible fixes include replacing piston rings or, in more severe cases, the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.0L)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) (paired with 1.6L Turbo)**

*   **Jerky Shifting/Hesitation at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DCT can exhibit jerky or hesitant shifting, particularly at low speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. This is a common characteristic of DCTs and not always a sign of a malfunction, but some owners find it bothersome.
    *   Solution: A software update or transmission control module (TCM) reflash can sometimes improve shifting behavior. In some cases, clutch replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DCT has been known to suddenly fail in a small percentage of cases. This may cause the vehicle to suddenly accelerate, or it can lose power and become unable to drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the DCT transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorbers Leaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the rear shock absorbers leading to fluid leakage and a bouncy ride. This issue seems more prevalent in colder climates or with frequent rough road driving.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (touchscreen, navigation, etc.) can freeze, become unresponsive, or exhibit significant lag. This is a common complaint.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset, updating the infotainment software, or, in some cases, replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the vehicle's battery draining prematurely, especially if the car sits for an extended period.
    *   Solution: Checking for parasitic draws, replacing the battery with an upgraded AGM battery, or ensuring all accessories are turned off when the vehicle is not in use.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Driver Seat Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Driver seat has a tendency to break down over time from constant use. This occurs often with the cushion or lumbar support and the seat frame itself.
    *   Solution: Replace the seat cushion, lumbar support, or the whole seat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headliner begins to sag as glue fails over time due to heat or humidity.
    *   Solution: Replace headliner or glue the headliner back into place.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Hyundai Elantra GT is generally a reliable vehicle. The most significant and potentially costly issues revolve around the 1.6L turbo engine's oil consumption and the 7-speed DCT's shifting behavior and potential for failure. Suspension issues and some electrical glitches with the infotainment system also appear to be recurring problems. While the DCT issues can be concerning, the relatively low cost of other repairs and the Elantra GT's overall value proposition still make it a worthwhile consideration, provided potential buyers are aware of these common complaints.
