### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Hyundai Azera generally presents a solid reliability record for its class and age. The most commonly reported technical issues tend to be related to the engine's oil seals and timing components, particularly on the V6 engines, and some transmission-related concerns like harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster problems, can also arise. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor are not immune to failure. However, many of these issues are not indicative of catastrophic failure and can be addressed with timely repairs. Overall, the Azera is a reasonably dependable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas for inspection.
