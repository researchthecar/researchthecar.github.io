### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Hyundai Azera is a generally dependable vehicle, particularly for its segment. The most commonly cited issues tend to revolve around the powertrain and some electrical components. Engine oil and coolant leaks are not uncommon as the vehicle ages, and transmission issues like harsh shifting can arise. Suspension components, such as control arm bushings and strut mounts, may require attention. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can also occur. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not typically indicative of a fundamentally flawed design. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate these potential problems and ensure the Azera's continued serviceability.
