The 2009 Hyundai Azera is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and generous features list for its price point. Engine options included a 3.3L V6 (263 horsepower, 257 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.8L V6 (263 horsepower, 255 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Azera's smooth ride and quiet cabin but sometimes criticize its somewhat bland styling and handling. Reliability is generally considered good, but certain issues do surface consistently.

**Engine**

**3.3L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil light illuminating or noticing a significant decrease in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels diligently and addressing any leaks are crucial first steps. If consumption is excessive, piston rings may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.8L V6**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners sometimes report hearing a knocking or pinging sound, especially under acceleration or when the engine is under load. This can be related to carbon buildup or potentially issues with the knock sensors.
    *   Solution: Using higher-octane fuel might temporarily alleviate the issue. Cleaning the fuel injectors and intake system to remove carbon deposits can help. If the problem persists, the knock sensors themselves might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or delayed shifts, particularly between certain gears. Slipping during acceleration can also occur.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change, ensuring the correct fluid type is used. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal wear within the transmission may require more extensive repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $2,000 - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging/Weak Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners notice that the rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, particularly when carrying passengers or cargo. This can lead to a bouncy ride and reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear springs is the common solution. Upgrading to aftermarket springs designed for heavier loads might be considered.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Clock Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the clock spring can cause the airbag warning light to illuminate, the horn to stop working, and the steering wheel controls to malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clock spring assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Seat Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power seats may stop working or only move in certain directions. This can be caused by a faulty motor, a broken switch, or damaged wiring.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause of the problem and replacing the faulty component (motor, switch, or wiring).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture accumulating inside the headlight housings, leading to reduced visibility and potential damage to the bulbs and electrical components.
    *   Solution: Sealing the headlight housing or replacing the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may fail to open or close properly, or it may make excessive noise during operation. This can be caused by a faulty motor, damaged tracks, or broken seals.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause of the problem and repairing or replacing the faulty components (motor, tracks, or seals).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators may fail, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking electronically.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2009 Hyundai Azera is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues like excessive oil consumption, transmission issues, and electrical glitches. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission replacement, can be costly. Addressing these issues promptly can help prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's overall reliability and value. The severity of issues ranges from minor inconveniences like a faulty clock spring to more significant problems requiring major engine or transmission work.
