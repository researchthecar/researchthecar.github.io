*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnosis is required, possibly pointing to valve body issues or internal wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $2,000+ (transmission rebuild or replacement).

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay when shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse. The car may hesitate before moving.
    *   Solution: Can be caused by low transmission fluid, a faulty solenoid, or internal transmission damage. Check fluid levels and condition first. Then consider a transmission service.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid top-off) - $2,000+ (transmission rebuild or replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits unused for a few days. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic drains by testing the current draw with the ignition off. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.

**Summary**

The 2014 Hyundai Azera is a generally reliable car, but owners should be aware of potential issues related to the engine (stalling and oil leaks), transmission (harsh shifting), and electrical system (battery drain, infotainment issues). Suspension and interior issues such as seat motor failure are also potential problems to consider. While most issues aren't catastrophic, they can lead to repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, especially if major components like the transmission need replacement.
