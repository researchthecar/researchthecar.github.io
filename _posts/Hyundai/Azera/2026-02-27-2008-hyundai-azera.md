### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Hyundai Azera generally presents a solid reliability record for its class. The most commonly cited issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, specifically oil leaks and potential timing chain concerns for both V6 engine options. The automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit harsh shifting. Suspension components like sway bar links and strut mounts are typical wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module or alternator, are also noted. While not immune to problems, many of these are repairable and not indicative of a fundamentally flawed vehicle. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can significantly extend the life and reliability of the Azera.
