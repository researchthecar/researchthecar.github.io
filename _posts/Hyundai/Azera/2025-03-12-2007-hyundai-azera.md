The 2007 Hyundai Azera is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and generous features for its price point. It offered a smooth driving experience and a well-appointed cabin, making it a popular choice for consumers seeking a value-oriented luxury car. The Azera was available with two engine options: a 3.3-liter V6 producing approximately 235 horsepower and 226 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8-liter V6 generating around 263 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the Azera's comfort and features, some common complaints include electrical issues, suspension problems, and occasional engine-related concerns.

**Engine**

**3.3L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.8L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. The noise may disappear after the engine warms up. Can eventually lead to engine misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioner, and possibly related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, check engine light illuminated. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) P0335 and P0339 are often present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shaking or vibration during light acceleration, often between 30-45 mph. The shuddering is felt most when the transmission is attempting to lock up the torque converter.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush might temporarily alleviate the issue. However, the eventual replacement of the torque converter is often the only permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200 (fluid flush), $800 - $1,500+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or erratic shifting between gears, where the engine RPMs increase significantly before the transmission engages the next gear.
    *   Solution: Initially, a transmission fluid flush and filter change. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200 (fluid flush), $500 - $1,200 (valve body), $2,500 - $4,500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces. Reduced ride comfort and handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts. It is often recommended to replace struts and shocks at the same time since you will already have the suspension disassembled.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (per pair, including struts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits noticeably lower than the front. This can cause a harsh ride, reduced handling stability, and potential damage to the rear shocks and struts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Climate Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The climate control system may fail to blow cold air or blow hot air intermittently. The blend door actuator is a common culprit.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows stop working or operate slowly and erratically.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

    *   Solution: Sunroof lubrication. Replacement of the sunroof motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $20 for lubricant. $200-$600 for motor replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Hyundai Azera, while generally a comfortable and well-equipped car, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine problems like timing chain issues in the 3.8L V6 can be costly. Transmission problems such as torque converter shudder can also lead to significant repair expenses. Electrical issues and suspension problems are more common and, while typically less expensive, can still be frustrating. Overall, potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify and address any existing or potential problems before purchasing the vehicle. Addressing these issues promptly can ensure a more reliable and enjoyable ownership experience.
