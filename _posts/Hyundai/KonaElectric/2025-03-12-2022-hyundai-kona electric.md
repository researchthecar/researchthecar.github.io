The 2022 Hyundai Kona Electric is a popular subcompact SUV known for its affordability, long range, and practical size. It is only available as a fully electric vehicle, powered by a single electric motor. The motor produces 201 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Kona Electric for its peppy acceleration, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. However, some common complaints include limited rear passenger space and a relatively small cargo area. Due to it being an electric vehicle, it does not have an engine and transmission.

*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Software Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the BMS software, leading to inaccurate state of charge (SOC) readings, premature battery degradation warnings, or even unexpected power loss. This can manifest as the car displaying a higher or lower range than is actually available, or the car shutting down unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: A software update is typically required to recalibrate the BMS and address the underlying issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under warranty. If out of warranty, could cost upwards of $100+ for diagnostic and reprogramming.
    *   Recalls: 23V-185

* **Motor Control Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of complete or intermittent failure of the Motor Control Unit (MCU). Symptoms can include a complete loss of power, error messages related to the motor, or inconsistent performance.
    * Solution: The Motor Control Unit typically needs to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under warranty, if out of warranty, can cost thousands of dollars.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Premature Battery Capacity Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have observed faster than expected battery capacity degradation. This results in a reduced driving range compared to the original specifications. Factors like climate, charging habits, and driving style can influence battery health, but some Kona Electric owners have reported more significant degradation than anticipated.
    *   Solution: Hyundai will evaluate battery health and, if it falls below a certain threshold within the warranty period, may replace the battery pack. Preventative measures include avoiding frequent fast charging and maintaining a charge level between 20-80% for daily use.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under warranty if capacity degradation is excessive. Replacement out of warranty can be very expensive, often exceeding $10,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: A software update may resolve some of these issues. In other cases, a hardware replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update usually free at dealership. Infotainment unit replacement can cost $500 - $1,500 depending on the dealer.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced excessive drain on the 12V auxiliary battery, leading to starting problems or the inability to access vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include faulty sensors, aftermarket accessories drawing power while the vehicle is off, or a defective 12V battery. Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty component is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the cause and parts needed.

**Summary**

The 2022 Hyundai Kona Electric is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners have reported issues with the Battery Management System software, infotainment issues, 12V battery drain, seat comfort, and charging port doors. The most concerning issue is premature battery degradation, which can significantly impact the vehicle's range and value, but it is usually covered under warranty if excessive. Repair costs vary depending on the issue, but major electrical component replacements can be expensive if not covered by warranty. Owners should monitor their battery health, and stay on top of software updates to mitigate potential problems.
