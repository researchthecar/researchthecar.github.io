**Summary**

The 2020 Hyundai Kona Electric offers an attractive package, but potential buyers should be aware of the reported issues. The high voltage battery pack issues, while not affecting every vehicle, are a significant concern due to the high cost of replacement. Electrical issues with the 12V battery and charging system are also relatively common and can be frustrating. The automatic emergency braking problems are serious due to the safety concerns. Infotainment glitches are less critical but detract from the overall ownership experience. Overall, it is best to check out as many options as possible before purchasing one.
