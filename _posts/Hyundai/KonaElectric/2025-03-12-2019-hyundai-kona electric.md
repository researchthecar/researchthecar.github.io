The 2019 Hyundai Kona Electric is a subcompact electric SUV lauded for its long range (EPA estimated 258 miles), nimble handling, and user-friendly technology. It features a single electric motor producing 201 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque, paired with a single-speed reduction gear transmission. Owners often appreciate its practicality, efficiency, and engaging driving experience, but some common criticisms include a relatively small back seat, limited cargo space, and in some cases, battery-related concerns.

**Electric Motor**

* **High Voltage Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the high-voltage battery pack, including complete failure or reduced capacity leading to significantly decreased range. Error codes related to the battery management system may be present. Some users have reported issues with the earlier LG Chem battery packs.
    * Solution: The battery needs to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $15,000+
    * Recalls: 2020-09-14 (Campaign Number 20V594000) - potential internal short circuit due to manufacturing defects in certain high-voltage batteries.  This could increase the risk of fire.
2021-03-05 (Campaign Number 21V124000) - Same issue as the previous recall but a software update will temporarily limit the battery charge to 80% to mitigate fire risk until the batteries can be fully replaced.

**Single-Speed Reduction Gear Transmission**

**Electrical**

* **12V Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have experienced issues with the 12V auxiliary battery draining prematurely, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or requiring frequent jump starts. This can be caused by parasitic drain from various systems within the car.
    * Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic drain. Replacing the 12V battery with a higher-quality AGM battery may also help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the complexity of the parasitic drain issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Charging System Errors**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some users have reported problems with the vehicle's charging system, including error messages during charging, inability to charge at all, or slow charging speeds. This can be related to the onboard charger, the charging port, or the charging cable.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the charging system to identify the faulty component (onboard charger, charging port, or cable) and replacing it. Software updates have also been released to address charging-related issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the component that needs to be replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Cracking Tail Lights**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed cracks appearing in the tail light lenses. This issue seems to be more prevalent in certain climates.
    * Solution: Replacing the cracked tail light assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may intermittently freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot. This can impact access to navigation, audio, and vehicle settings.
    * Solution: A software update may fix the problem. If not, the system may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if a software update resolves the issue) to $500+ for replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2019 Hyundai Kona Electric is a generally reliable vehicle, but a few key issues stand out. The most concerning, and potentially costly, is the high-voltage battery, which can suffer from reduced capacity or complete failure. This is covered by recalls in many cases, but owners should be aware of the potential for this expensive repair. Other common issues include 12V battery drain, charging system errors, and infotainment system problems. The cracking tail lights are a more minor but still irritating problem. The overall severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs. While the battery issue can be very expensive, many other problems are relatively affordable to address.
