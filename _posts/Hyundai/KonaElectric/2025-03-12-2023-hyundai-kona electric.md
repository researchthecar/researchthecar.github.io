The 2023 Hyundai Kona Electric is a subcompact electric SUV that offers a fun driving experience, decent range, and a stylish design. It's powered by a single permanent-magnet synchronous motor, which produces 201 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque. The Kona Electric is generally praised for its quick acceleration, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. However, some common complaints include a relatively small back seat, limited cargo space, and the potential for long charging times depending on the charging station. The vehicle only comes with one motor and transmission option.

**Electric Motor**

**Single Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor (201 hp/291 lb-ft)**

*   **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the vehicle suddenly entering "turtle mode," significantly reducing power output. This can occur under various driving conditions and battery charge levels, and the dashboard displays a turtle icon. This issue is frequently accompanied by error messages such as "Check Electric Vehicle System."
    *   Solution: In some cases, restarting the vehicle temporarily resolves the issue. However, a permanent fix often requires a visit to the dealership for diagnosis and repair. Potential causes include faulty battery management system (BMS) software, issues with the motor controller, or individual cell problems within the high-voltage battery pack. A software update may be sufficient, but hardware replacements might be necessary in more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause. Software updates may be free. Hardware repairs can range from $500 for a sensor to several thousand for a motor controller or battery module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery Pack**

*   **Premature Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing more rapid battery degradation than expected. This manifests as a noticeable decrease in the vehicle's range over a relatively short period. Several factors contribute to this, including frequent fast charging, consistently charging to 100%, or exposure to extreme temperatures.
    *   Solution: While there isn't always a direct "fix," best practices can mitigate further degradation. These include limiting DC fast charging frequency, avoiding charging to 100% unless necessary, and parking in shaded areas during hot weather. If the battery degrades beyond a certain threshold within the warranty period, replacement or repair may be covered under the vehicle's battery warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement outside of warranty can be a significant expense, potentially $8,000 - $20,000 depending on the battery size.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash entirely. This may affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions integrated into the system.
    *   Solution: A simple reboot of the infotainment system may temporarily resolve the problem (usually by holding the power button). However, if the issue persists, a software update from the dealership is typically required. In rare cases, hardware replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are generally free at the dealership. Infotainment unit replacement could cost $500 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported difficulty charging their Kona Electric, including the vehicle not recognizing the charging cable, slow charging speeds, or the charging process abruptly stopping. This can occur at both public charging stations and with home chargers.
    *   Solution: First, try a different charging station or cable to rule out external factors. If the problem persists, the issue could be with the vehicle's onboard charger, the charging port, or the battery management system. A visit to the dealership is required for diagnosis and repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the component. A faulty charging port might cost $300-$500 to replace, while an onboard charger could be $800 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In some cases, owners have reported the Automatic Emergency Braking system engaging unnecessarily, even when there are no obstacles in the vehicle's path. This can be startling and potentially dangerous.
    *   Solution: A dealership visit is required to diagnose and recalibrate the AEB system. This may involve adjusting the sensitivity of the sensors or updating the system's software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Recalibration might be covered under warranty. Otherwise, expect to pay $100 - $300 for diagnosis and recalibration.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Hyundai Kona Electric, while generally a well-regarded EV, can experience some issues. Electrical problems, particularly those related to the infotainment system and charging, are common and can be inconvenient. The potential for reduced power/turtle mode can be a significant concern. While some issues are relatively minor and easily resolved, others, such as battery degradation, can be more serious and costly to address. Before purchasing, prospective buyers should research warranty coverage and inquire about any known issues with the vehicle.
