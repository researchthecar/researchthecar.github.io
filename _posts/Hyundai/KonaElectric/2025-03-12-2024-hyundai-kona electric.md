The 2024 Hyundai Kona Electric is an all-electric subcompact SUV that offers a blend of practicality, affordability, and decent range. The 2024 Kona Electric is powered by a single electric motor that produces 201 horsepower and 188 lb-ft of torque and is paired with a single-speed reduction gear transmission. It comes standard with a 64.8 kWh battery pack, offering an EPA-estimated range of 260 miles. People generally appreciate the Kona Electric's responsive acceleration, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. Some common dislikes include the limited cargo space compared to some competitors and the charging time, which, while improved, is still longer than refueling a gasoline car.

**Summary**

The 2024 Hyundai Kona Electric appears to have a mix of minor and more serious potential issues. The most concerning are potential issues with the MCU, battery degradation, and AEB. While not necessarily widespread, these would be the most costly to address outside of warranty. The infotainment and interior trim issues are more common and relatively less severe. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and ensure the vehicle has a thorough pre-purchase inspection, especially regarding the high-voltage system and battery health.
