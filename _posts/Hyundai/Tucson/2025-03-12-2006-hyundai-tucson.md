The 2006 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV that offered a blend of practicality and value. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 (140 hp, 136 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.7L V6 (173 hp, 178 lb-ft of torque). The 2.0L was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.7L came exclusively with the 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate its affordability, fuel economy (with the 2.0L), and comfortable ride. Common complaints include the relatively low power of the 2.0L engine, some cheap interior plastics, and potential for rust.

**Summary**

The 2006 Hyundai Tucson has some known issues, with rust being the most prevalent and potentially costly to address. Engine issues are relatively minor, but timing belt replacement is crucial for the 2.0L. Transmission issues, while less common, can be expensive to repair. Suspension components like strut mounts and bushings tend to wear out with age, leading to noise and handling problems. Electrical issues such as power windows and door locks are also common. The severity and cost of these issues range from relatively minor and inexpensive fixes to more serious and costly repairs, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2006 Tucson.
