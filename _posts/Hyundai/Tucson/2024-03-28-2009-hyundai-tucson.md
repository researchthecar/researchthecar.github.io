**Introduction to the 2009 Hyundai Tucson**

The 2009 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable and affordable driving experience. It is available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-four that produces 140 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7-liter V6 that produces 173 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission.

Drivers appreciate the Tucson's spacious interior, user-friendly infotainment system, and agile handling. However, some reviewers note a lack of power from the four-cylinder engine and a somewhat stiff ride quality.
