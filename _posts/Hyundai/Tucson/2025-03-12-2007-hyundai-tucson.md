The 2007 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV that offers a blend of practicality and affordability. Available engine options include a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing around 140 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.7L V6 engine generating approximately 173 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices consist of a 5-speed manual (only available with the 2.0L) and a 4-speed automatic transmission, which is standard with the V6 and optional with the 2.0L. Owners generally appreciate the Tucson's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and ease of parking. However, common criticisms include unimpressive fuel economy, especially with the V6 engine, and some reports of reliability issues as the vehicles age.
