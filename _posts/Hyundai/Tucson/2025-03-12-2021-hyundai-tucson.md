The 2021 Hyundai Tucson represents the beginning of the fourth generation of this popular compact SUV. It's lauded for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and ample features for the price. However, some owners have reported experiencing certain issues. The standard engine is a 2.5-liter inline-4 producing 187 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid powertrain is also available, combining a 1.6-liter turbocharged engine with an electric motor. Some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, specifically connectivity problems with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and some minor build quality issues. Some owners have also reported issues with the vehicle starting in cold temperatures.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

* **Engine Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. This may be indicated by the low oil pressure warning light illuminating, or by visually checking the oil level on the dipstick and finding it significantly lower than the full mark.
    * Solution: A dealer inspection to determine the rate of oil consumption is recommended. If consumption is deemed excessive, potential solutions could involve replacing piston rings or other engine components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the engine repair or replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced stalling or hesitation, particularly during acceleration from a stop or at low speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    * Solution: Diagnostics may include checking the fuel system, ignition system, and sensors (such as the mass airflow sensor). A software update to the engine control unit (ECU) might also be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (paired with 2.5L Engine)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears (e.g., 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd). This can be more noticeable during cold starts or during periods of heavy acceleration.
    * Solution: Some owners have found that a transmission control module (TCM) software update can improve shift quality. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission overhaul may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    * Solution: A software update from the dealer is often the first step. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue) - $1,500+ (for infotainment unit replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Connectivity Issues (Apple CarPlay/Android Auto)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty connecting to Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, intermittent disconnections, or failure to recognize the connected device.
    * Solution: Check the USB cable, ensure the phone's software is up to date, and try a different USB port. A software update to the infotainment system from the dealer may also resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if cable or phone software is the issue) - $100+ (for dealer software update).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially when the vehicle is not driven for several days. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    * Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify the source of the parasitic drain. Possible causes include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a defective battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and repair needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Automatic Tailgate Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The automatic tailgate may fail to open or close properly, or may stop midway through its operation. This can be caused by a faulty motor, sensor, or hydraulic strut.
    * Solution: Inspection and replacement of the faulty component (motor, sensor, or strut).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the component needing replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises emanating from various areas of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    * Solution: Locating and addressing the source of the rattle. This may involve tightening loose fasteners, adding padding, or replacing worn components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the source and complexity of the repair).
