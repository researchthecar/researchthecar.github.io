The 2016 Hyundai Tucson marked the beginning of the third generation of this popular compact SUV. It offered a more stylish design and improved features compared to its predecessor. Engine options included a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine delivering 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine was paired with a traditional 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6T was mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praised the Tucson for its comfortable ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and generous warranty. However, some common complaints revolved around the DCT's behavior, particularly jerky shifting at low speeds, and reported issues with the engine.

**Engine**

**2.0L Nu GDI I4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly while driving, especially at low speeds or when coming to a stop. This can be intermittent and without warning.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by a faulty Idle Air Control valve (IAC), mass airflow sensor, or fuel pump issue. Diagnose the root cause with a scan tool and replace the failing part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Gamma Turbo GDI I4**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking or pinging sound coming from the engine, especially under acceleration. This can indicate pre-ignition or detonation issues.
    *   Solution: Ensure proper octane fuel is used. Could also indicate carbon buildup on valves, requiring a fuel system cleaning or walnut blasting of the intake valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Paired with 2.0L Engine)**
*No Issues Found*

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) (Paired with 1.6L Turbo Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerky Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or jerky shifting, especially at low speeds and in stop-and-go traffic. Hesitation upon acceleration is also common.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer might improve the shift quality. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush or even replacement of the clutch pack may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $2,000+ (clutch pack replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn or damaged rear shocks, sway bar links, or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain prematurely, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a short period of time.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested to rule out a faulty battery. Also, check for parasitic draws by testing each fuse individually for a draw when the car is turned off.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or may become stuck in either position. This issue is more common on models equipped with the smart liftgate feature.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts, motor, and sensors for damage or malfunction. Replacement of the faulty component is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot while driving.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. If the problem persists, a software update from the dealer may be necessary. In some cases, the infotainment unit itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $800+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2016 Hyundai Tucson, while generally a reliable vehicle, does exhibit some common issues. The most prevalent concerns are related to the 7-speed DCT, specifically harsh shifting. Engine knocking and suspension noises are also reported. While not all issues are severe, the potential cost to repair the DCT can be significant. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and thoroughly inspect the transmission during a test drive, especially on models equipped with the 1.6L turbo engine. Overall, the severity and cost of repairs range from minor inconvenience to potentially expensive transmission work.
