Okay, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2012 Hyundai Tucson, organized as requested, based on available data and focusing on reported problems beyond normal wear and tear. The 2012 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV offering a blend of practicality and fuel efficiency. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing around 165 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.4L inline-4 engine producing about 176 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Tucson for its styling, fuel economy (especially with the 2.0L), and value for money. Criticisms often centered on the ride quality (some found it firm), and the sometimes-sluggish acceleration, particularly when the 2.0L engine was under load.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls unexpectedly while driving or idling. Can occur intermittently, making diagnosis challenging.
    *   Solution: Troubleshooting to identify cause (sensor failure, fuel delivery issues). Replacing faulty components like the crankshaft position sensor or fuel pump relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Engine Knocking/Tickling Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise coming from the engine, often more noticeable at idle or low speeds. May indicate rod knock or other internal engine damage.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the source of the noise. This can include checking the oil level, listening to the engine with a stethoscope, or even performing an engine tear-down. Depending on the severity, the solution may include a complete engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+ for initial diagnosis, $3,000 - $6,000+ for engine replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky gear changes, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. Hesitation or delay when shifting gears.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush/change using the correct fluid type. If the problem persists, further diagnostics are needed, which may involve checking the solenoids, valve body, or other internal components. A complete transmission replacement may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush, $500 - $1,500+ for solenoid or valve body repair, $2,500 - $5,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Coil Spring Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear coil springs can break, leading to a noticeable sag in the rear suspension, uneven tire wear, and a clunking or rattling noise from the rear when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the broken coil springs. It's recommended to replace both rear coil springs at the same time to ensure even suspension performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (for both springs and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Intermittent Radio/Navigation System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio or navigation system may intermittently lose power, freeze, or display errors. This can be caused by a faulty head unit, loose wiring connections, or a software glitch.
    *   Solution: Check wiring connections and fuses. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced. A software update may also resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ for diagnostics and wiring repairs, $300 - $1,000+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS/Traction Control Light Illumination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABS and/or traction control light illuminates on the dashboard. This could be due to a faulty wheel speed sensor, a problem with the ABS module, or a wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to determine the cause of the light. Replacement of faulty wheel speed sensors or repair of the ABS module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for wheel speed sensor replacement, $500 - $1,500+ for ABS module repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may leak, fail to open/close properly, or make excessive noise during operation.
    *   Solution: Clean and lubricate sunroof tracks. Replace faulty sunroof motor or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for cleaning and lubrication, $200 - $500+ for motor or seal replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning system blows warm air, or fails to cool the cabin effectively.
    *   Solution: Check refrigerant level, inspect for leaks. Replace faulty compressor, condenser, or other A/C components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for refrigerant recharge and leak detection, $300 - $1,000+ for component replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Hyundai Tucson, while generally a reliable vehicle, can be subject to certain common issues. Engine knocking/tickling noise and engine stalling could indicate major and potentially costly repairs. Electrical problems with the radio/navigation, ABS/Traction control, and mechanical problems with the transmission and suspension are also significant and could be expensive to fix. Addressing these potential issues proactively is important to ensuring a dependable driving experience.
