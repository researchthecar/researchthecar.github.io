Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2018 Hyundai Tucson, categorized by component and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2018 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable ride, a user-friendly infotainment system, and good value for the money. However, some owners have reported issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The Tucson offers two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 producing 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L turbo engine is paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Some common praises of the 2018 Tucson include its stylish exterior, comfortable seating, and ample cargo space. Criticisms often revolve around the sometimes sluggish acceleration of the base engine and the occasionally jerky behavior of the DCT.
