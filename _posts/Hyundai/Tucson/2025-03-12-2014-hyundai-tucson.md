The 2014 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV that was offered with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque and a more powerful 2.4L inline-4 generating 182 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciated the Tucson for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and value for the money. Common complaints included subpar fuel economy and a somewhat unrefined powertrain, particularly with the base 2.0L engine.
