Alright, here is a breakdown of the common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2010 Hyundai Tucson, categorized by component, and including engine/transmission specific problems.

The 2010 Hyundai Tucson represented a significant redesign for the model, offering a more stylish and modern crossover SUV. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 140 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque and a more powerful 2.4-liter inline-4 engine generating 176 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual (2.0L only) or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Tucson was praised for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and attractive design. However, some owners have reported issues with engine problems, electrical glitches, and other reliability concerns that could impact its long-term ownership experience.
