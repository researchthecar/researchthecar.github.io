The 2022 Hyundai Tucson represents the fourth generation of this popular compact SUV. Available with a 2.5L inline-4 gasoline engine producing 187 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, a 1.6L turbocharged gasoline engine paired with an electric motor creating the hybrid powertrain, and also a plug-in hybrid option.
