The 2023 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV lauded for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and generous features for its price point. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4, a 1.6L turbo hybrid, and a 1.6L turbo plug-in hybrid. The 2.5L engine produces 187 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid options prioritize fuel efficiency and offer a different driving experience. What owners generally appreciate is the Tucson's value, spacious interior, and modern technology. Common dislikes include the sometimes sluggish acceleration of the base engine and some concerns about the infotainment system's complexity.
