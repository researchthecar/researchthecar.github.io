### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Hyundai Tucson generally presents as a reasonably reliable compact SUV, with the 2.0L engine being particularly robust. The 2.7L V6 may encounter oil leaks over time. Automatic transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, are not uncommon and can be costly to repair. Suspension components like struts and ball joints may require attention as the vehicle ages. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and instrument clusters, have been reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, while not immune to common automotive wear and tear, the Tucson offers a decent value proposition if well-maintained, with most issues being repairable without breaking the bank, though transmission repairs can be a significant expense.
