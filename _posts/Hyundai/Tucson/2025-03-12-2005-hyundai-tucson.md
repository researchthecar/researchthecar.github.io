**Summary**

The 2005 Hyundai Tucson, while generally a reliable vehicle, has its share of common problems as it ages. Engine issues such as timing belt failures (2.7L V6) can be costly to address if neglected. Transmission issues like harsh shifting can also become a significant concern. Suspension components like strut mounts can wear out, leading to noise and compromised ride quality. Electrical problems such as power window motor and ABS sensor failures are common, and rust can be a concern in certain climates. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchase.
