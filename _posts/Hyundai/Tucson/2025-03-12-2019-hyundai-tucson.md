The 2019 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV offering a blend of practicality, comfort, and value. Engine options include a 2.0L inline-4 producing 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.4L inline-4 generating 181 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Tucson for its user-friendly infotainment system, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. However, some criticisms include the base engine feeling underpowered and occasional transmission hesitation.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls unexpectedly at low speeds or when idling, sometimes accompanied by a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Software update to the ECU (Engine Control Unit) to correct fuel delivery issues. Replacing the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor has also been a common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Piston Ring Failure and Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: High oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be present. Engine knocking or ticking noises could develop over time, and possibly engine failure.
    *   Solution: Perform oil consumption test to confirm the issue. Replacing the pistons and piston rings is a common repair and potentially replacing the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: 2019 Hyundai Tucson Recalls: NHTSA Campaign Numbers: 20V240000 (Engine Compartment Fire)

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or when attempting to pass.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and refill with the correct fluid type is a good start. A software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) to improve shift logic. In severe cases, replacement of valve body or the entire transmission may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a few days of non-use, resulting in difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic draw by testing individual circuits. Potential culprits include a faulty alternator, a module not going into sleep mode, or a defective aftermarket accessory.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or randomly reboots while driving.
    *   Solution: Software update to the infotainment system. Replacing the head unit is another potential solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Replace the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per headlight
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leak/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension feels bouncy or unstable, especially over bumps. Visible fluid leaks from the rear shock absorbers.
    * Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers. Replacement in pairs is always recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (for both)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2019 Hyundai Tucson has some common problems that potential owners should be aware of. Engine issues, especially with the 2.4L involving oil consumption, can be costly. Transmission issues with harsh shifting can be addressed with software updates or fluid replacements but can become more expensive repairs. Electrical issues are common and are on the lower end of repairs.
