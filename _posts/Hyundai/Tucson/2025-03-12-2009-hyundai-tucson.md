The 2009 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV known for its affordability and practicality. Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder producing approximately 140 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7-liter V6 delivering around 173 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions are a 4-speed automatic (for both engines) and a 5-speed manual (primarily paired with the 2.0L engine). Owners often appreciate the Tucson's comfortable ride and spacious interior for its class. Common dislikes include perceived lack of power with the 2.0L engine, fuel economy that is not the best, and some concerns about long-term reliability.
