The 2011 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV known for its stylish design, fuel efficiency, and value. Available with two engine options, a 2.0L inline-4 producing 165 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.4L inline-4 generating 176 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual (limited availability with the 2.0L) or a 6-speed automatic transmission.

The transmission can exhibit harsh shifting, and electrical issues like battery drain and airbag malfunctions can occur. Suspension components, particularly the rear coil springs, are also prone to failure. While some issues can be relatively inexpensive to fix, engine problems can be quite costly.
