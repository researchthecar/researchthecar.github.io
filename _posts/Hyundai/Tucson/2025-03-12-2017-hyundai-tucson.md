The 2017 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV offering a balance of value, practicality, and features. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque and a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 generating 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, although a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) was available on models equipped with the 1.6L turbo engine. Owners often praise the Tucson for its comfortable ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and ample cargo space. Common dislikes include lackluster acceleration with the base engine and some reported reliability concerns.
