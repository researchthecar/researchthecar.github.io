The 2013 Hyundai Tucson is a compact SUV known for its value and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.4L inline-4 generating 182 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Tucson's comfortable ride and ample cargo space, but some have reported concerns about engine issues and electrical problems.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls while driving, especially at low speeds or when coming to a stop. May be accompanied by rough idling.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the throttle body, updating the engine control unit (ECU) software, or replacing the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knocking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking, or knocking noise coming from the engine, especially when cold. This could be a sign of piston slap or early connecting rod bearing wear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm the location and cause of the noise. If severe engine damage is found, engine replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for diagnostic, $3,000+ for engine replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rapid decrease in engine oil level between oil changes. Possible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Hyundai issued Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) 21-EM-004H to address this concern. Repair options include engine replacement under warranty if the vehicle meets the specified criteria (mileage, date of first use, etc.). Out-of-warranty solutions may involve piston ring replacement, or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (under warranty) - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: 23V-651 (Partial engine failure, increased fire risk)

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts between gears, particularly noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and potentially replacing the transmission fluid. May also require reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission overhaul is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for fluid replacement, $500 - $1500+ for valve body, $2,000+ for transmission overhaul.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs up, but the car doesn't accelerate properly. This can be intermittent, or may occur in specific gears.
    *   Solution: Requires transmission diagnosis to determine the cause. Options include valve body replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ for valve body, $2,000+ for transmission overhaul/replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the rear suspension when driving over bumps or uneven road surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn sway bar links or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not in use. Requires frequent jump-starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the parasitic drain. Common culprits include a faulty alternator, aftermarket accessories, or a malfunctioning electrical component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Door Locks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks fail to operate properly, either intermittently or completely.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty door lock actuators.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag warning light illuminated on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Requires diagnostic scan to determine the cause. Common causes include a faulty clock spring in the steering wheel, or a malfunctioning seatbelt pretensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the faulty component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Hyundai Tucson has some reported issues, particularly with the engine and transmission. The 2.4L engine appears to be more prone to issues like excessive oil consumption. The transmission can also exhibit rough shifting or slipping, which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues such as battery drain and malfunctioning door locks are also reported. While some of these issues are relatively minor, engine or transmission problems can be more severe and expensive to fix. Buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection done by a qualified mechanic to check for these potential problems.
