**Introduction:**

The 1992 Hyundai Scoupe is a compact sports car powered by a 1.5L SOHC inline-4 engine producing 89 horsepower and 95 lb-ft of torque. It was available with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The Scoupe was praised for its sporty handling and affordable price but criticized for its lackluster performance and cramped interior.

**Engine**

**1.5L SOHC Inline-4**

* **Intake Valve Sticking:** Valves can stick due to carbon buildup, leading to misfires, rough idling, and reduced power.
    * Solution: Remove and clean the affected valves.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
* **Head Gasket Failure:** The head gasket can fail prematurely, causing coolant and oil leaks.
    * Solution: Replace the head gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Synchronizer Wear:** Synchronizers can wear out over time, leading to difficult shifting, especially into 2nd and 3rd gears.
    * Solution: Replace the worn synchronizers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Valve Body Failure:** The valve body can malfunction, causing erratic shifting or transmission slipping.
    * Solution: Replace the valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $1800
* **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter can lock up prematurely, causing shuddering or transmission slipping.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1500

**Suspension**

* **Strut Failure:** Struts can wear out over time, leading to reduced ride comfort, poor handling, and tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace the worn struts.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300

**Summary:**

The 1992 Hyundai Scoupe has several potential issues, particularly with its engine (intake valve sticking and head gasket failure), transmission (synchronizer wear and torque converter failure), and suspension (strut failure). These issues can be costly to repair, ranging from a few hundred dollars to over $1000 in some cases. However, the Scoupe remains a popular choice for budget-minded enthusiasts seeking a sporty compact car.
