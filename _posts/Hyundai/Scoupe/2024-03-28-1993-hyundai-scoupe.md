**Introduction**

The 1993 Hyundai Scoupe is a compact sports car that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base model came with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that produced 82 horsepower and 96 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine was also available, which produced 113 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.
