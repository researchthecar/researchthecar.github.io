Okay, here is a breakdown of potential issues and complaints related to the 2024 Hyundai Grand i10, formatted as requested. Please note that this is based on information available up to the current date and may evolve as more vehicles accumulate mileage and time on the road. As a newer model, comprehensive long-term data is still emerging. Also, specific issues can vary based on geographic region, driving conditions, and maintenance practices.

The 2024 Hyundai Grand i10 is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and relatively spacious interior for its class. Engine options typically include a 1.2-liter Kappa petrol engine producing around 82 horsepower and 84 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are usually a 5-speed manual or an Automated Manual Transmission (AMT). People generally appreciate the i10's maneuverability, ease of parking, and value proposition. Common dislikes center around its modest power output, basic features in lower trims, and potentially limited safety equipment depending on the specific market.

**Engine**

**1.2L Kappa Petrol Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, check engine light illumination. Could be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors. Diagnosis using an OBD-II scanner to pinpoint the affected cylinder is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the number of cylinders affected and if it needs to be taken into the shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warning light, the need to frequently add oil between scheduled oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: First, perform an oil consumption test to confirm the issue. If confirmed, the repair might involve replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+, depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding noise when shifting, difficulty engaging a specific gear (often 1st or reverse), stiff or notchy gear changes.
    *   Solution: Check the clutch cable or hydraulic system for proper adjustment and leaks. If those are okay, then it may be worn synchros or a damaged clutch. Replace the clutch assembly and/or repair the transmission internals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Automated Manual Transmission (AMT)**

*   **Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable lurching or jerking during gear changes, particularly at lower speeds. This is a common characteristic of AMTs, but excessive jerkiness can indicate a problem.
    *   Solution: Ensure the AMT fluid is at the correct level and in good condition. The AMT actuator might need recalibration or replacement. Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes improve shift quality.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension when driving over bumps. Steering may feel loose or vague.
    *   Solution: Inspect the suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.) for cracks or excessive play. Replace worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen becomes unresponsive, freezes, or restarts unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Try a soft reset of the system (consult the owner's manual). Check for software updates from Hyundai. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $800+ (for head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle is difficult to start or doesn't start at all after sitting for a short period.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Check for parasitic draws (devices that are draining power when the vehicle is off). Replace the battery if necessary and address any parasitic draws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poor Quality Door Handle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door handle does not release the door latch when pulled. Plastic can break.
    *   Solution: Replace the door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or buzzing sounds coming from the dashboard area, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle can be tricky. It may require disassembling parts of the dashboard to tighten fasteners, add padding, or replace loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Hyundai Grand i10, being a relatively new model, doesn't have a long track record of widespread issues. Reported issues are relatively minor and are typical of vehicles in its class. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences (like dashboard rattles) to more significant problems (like engine misfires or transmission problems), but none appear to be endemic to the model year at this point. Costs to repair vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage, but most repairs should be manageable within a reasonable budget for a vehicle in this segment. It's essential to stay informed about potential recalls and Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) issued by Hyundai to address any known issues.
