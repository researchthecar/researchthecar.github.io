The 2016 Hyundai Grand i10 is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and practicality, particularly suited for city driving. The 2016 model typically came with a 1.2-liter Kappa petrol engine, producing around 82 horsepower and 114 Nm of torque, or a 1.1-liter U2 CRDi diesel engine producing around 70 horsepower and 160 Nm of torque, depending on the market. Both engines were available with a 5-speed manual transmission, while the 1.2-liter petrol also had an option for a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its compact size, easy maneuverability, and affordability. Common criticisms include its basic interior, somewhat underpowered engine, and limited features in the base models.
