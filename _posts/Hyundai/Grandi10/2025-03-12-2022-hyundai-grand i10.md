The 2022 Hyundai Grand i10 is a popular compact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and surprisingly spacious interior for its class. Available engine options include a 1.2-liter Kappa petrol engine producing around 82 horsepower and 114 Nm of torque and a 1.0-liter petrol engine. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed Automated Manual Transmission (AMT). Owners often praise its ease of driving in urban environments, compact size, and feature-rich offerings for its price point.
