The 2023 Hyundai Grand i10 is a popular subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and nimble handling, making it a practical choice for city driving. Engine options typically include a 1.2-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 82 horsepower and 84 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT). Owners generally appreciate its compact size, ease of parking, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include the relatively modest power output, particularly when fully loaded, and the basic interior trim in lower trims. The following lists the common issues and complaints, categorized by vehicle system:

**Engine**

**1.2L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Engine Noise on Startup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise is present on cold starts, especially in colder climates. The noise usually diminishes as the engine warms up.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the valve train components, specifically the hydraulic lash adjusters. Replacement of faulty lash adjusters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automated Manual Transmission (AMT)**

*   **Jerky Shifting at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AMT can exhibit jerky and uneven shifting behavior, particularly when accelerating from a stop or during low-speed maneuvers. This is more pronounced in stop-and-go traffic.
    *   Solution: Recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM) software. Inspection and possible replacement of the clutch actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing or Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The touchscreen infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or spontaneously restarts. This can happen while using navigation, audio, or Bluetooth functions.
    *   Solution: Software update for the infotainment system. Replacement of the head unit if the software update doesn't resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Premature Corrosion on Brake Rotors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Surface rust and corrosion develop quickly on the brake rotors, even in areas with moderate climate conditions. This can lead to brake squeal and reduced braking performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the brake rotors and brake pads. Consider using higher-quality rotors with corrosion-resistant coatings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard or Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels, especially when driving on rough roads or at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: Identification and insulation of the source of the rattle using foam padding or sound-deadening material. Tightening loose fasteners or clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Hyundai Grand i10 generally exhibits a few common issues. While the engine noise is more of an annoyance than a serious problem, the AMT transmission issue may impact driveability. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and rattles within the interior are also recurring complaints. The exterior corrosion issue is an issue that should be addressed. The cost to remedy these issues can vary, with the jerky transmission and infotainment issues potentially incurring higher repair costs, with the transmission being the most concerning.
